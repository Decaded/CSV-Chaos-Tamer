1,,100CP,Benadryl Cabbagepatch,Invincible,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You have an incredible ability to make inferences and be correct. You truly are a natural at inductive and
deductive reasoning, able to use logic to fill in the gaps in your knowledge, you can guess with
reasonable accuracy when others would be left scratching their heads in consternation. This sort of
deduction is quite useful when trying to reverse engineer advanced technology."
2,,100CP,Genius,Stellaris,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"As expected from someone who broke through a barrier thought impossible by physics, you're a genius.
Your level of study in the three most important fields (Social, Engineering, and Physics) are enough to
have you be known as the premiere in all fields in your Empire."
3,,100CP,Good Enough For Science. Not Aperture Science!,Portal,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Pick one of these two options: one PhD in a subject which actually exists, or 3 PhDs in subjects which
only exist in Aperture. Applied physics of quantum tunneling, multiverse search algorithms, and event
horizon containment are examples of Aperture only degrees. You can buy this perk twice, but it's only
free once."
4,,100CP,Inconsistencies Without End,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You'll have to deal with it every time. Consistent internally but to the greater world a Wonder is a unique
item with no way to be properly defined by real science. Your intelligence has been enhanced, as well as
your ability to use logic and you've gained a rock solid understanding of the fundamental sciences of any
particular field you care to name in this world. After all you need a solid foundation if you are going to
deal with this inconsistent thing they call Inspiration. In addition to all that you have a high level of
patience now, able to wait through dozens of days of tests before committing to decisions if needs must."
5,,100CP,Librarian,Smash Up-Obligatory Cthulhu Supplement,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You have a phenomenal memory and organizational skill, and a real gift for research. It's a rare day
indeed where you can't find the information you need, or at least narrow it down to a single rare book."
6,,100CP,Nigredo,Lords of the Night - Zombies,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"The first step is breaking things down to their basics, before putting them back together. You always
understand how far you can atomize knowledge, and are able to source all the bits.
If you're starting an experiment, you can use this to completely break down your starting premise, break
down what you think you know, find every source for every one of those bits. You will keep discrete
knowledge of what you think every step is doing, what it's checking for. If you get unexpected results,
you'll be able to atomize what those results are, what conflicts with what you know, and what doesn't.
This makes you no more right than you were before, but helps immensely in figuring out where you're
wrong. Likewise, if you one day discover a source of yours was unreliable, you'll know every bit of
information you got from him directly or indirectly, and be able to find every conclusion you're using that
he contributed to.
It won't tell you which ones are manipulations, but you'll know that you have a bias because of
something he said to you in passing because you'll be able to identify every contributor to your every
bias."
7,,100CP,A Spark of Madness,World of Tentacles,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Greatness does not spring from mundane roots. The greatest geniuses are also madmen willing to spit in
the face of common sense, and you have that spark of madness in you. Within your mind is a perverse
wellspring of inspiration, and by immersing yourself in it you gain superhuman focus and the ability to
ignore your basic biological needs such as food or sleep or similar things that might distract you from the
task at hand, though you will need to recoup all of your “debts” once that task is complete. The products
of this “Madness Place” will tend to be skewed towards perverse uses in one way or another, but they
will always be highly effective at their intended purpose. You also gain an impressive maniacal laugh, as
well as the ability TO DRAMATICALLY EMPHASIZE YOUR WORDS!!!! and still be taken seriously."
8,,100CP,Not a Stupid Grunt,Mass Effect,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"That you are not. You are smart enough to be the foremost scientist in your field. This doesn't make you
so, but you could get there on your own with not a terrible amount of effort. Still not as smart as a drell,
but hey, who is?"
9,,100CP,PhDs,Fantastic Four,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Now this is the most obvious thing for you to have, isn't it? You have no less than three separate PhD,
covering any three areas of science you want. You're a leading expert and genius in each of these, a true
giant in the field. But more than these, you find you now also have documents, proofs and complete
records for any other degrees or qualifications you're, well, qualified to hold. So long as you have the
ability, you find that whatever is needed to indicate this just appears, complete with a full story behind it.
These records are entirely genuine, and are treated by everyone just as they would any other similar
documents."
10,,100CP,Savant's Understanding | Beautiful And Terrible,Exalted - The Infernals,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Savant's Understanding (100CP) A good scholar is one that understands quickly, and remembers their lessons well. Gaining a sharpened mind, you will make connections and associations extremely quickly, your burgeoning mind filling with ideas and potential solutions. But remembrance is just as important, so you will find that your memory is clear and enjoy near-perfect recall. Indeed, the memories of life and technology in the First Age, which your Exaltation retains from its past life as a scholar of note, are likewise quite clear. Even better, you will
find it easy to retain absurd amounts of newly acquired information. For some reason, this also makes it
easier for you to construct elaborate monologues to reveal the full genius of your grand schemes.
Beautiful And Terrible (Exalted -The Infernals) (Free)
You will be able to take on some of the demon realm’s splendor and have your visage refined, clearing up
scars, blemishes, modest asymmetry and other subtler imperfections in appearance."
11,,100CP,Terribly Clever,Dungeon Keeper Ami,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You are just so terribly clever, able to quickly think on your feet and spot connections where others
usually cannot. As well as being an overall quick thinker you also find it a bit easier to study and retain
information. You have the makings of a fabulous bookworm."
12,,100CP,Traditional Genius,SB Dragonball Z,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You're a traditional genius, a master of engineering, biology, and a dozen other sciences at the level of
Bulma Briefs in each of them. If you'd been a part of the scientific community of your planet, you'd
probably be considered the pinnacle of their scientists for generations to come. In addition to this your
mind is far greater than the average person, giving you a base IQ of 250 as well as eidetic memory."
13,,100CP,Well Qualified,Green Lantern,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Pick one field of science. You're now a world class expert, a true genius not just in that field, but in all the
fields associated with it. A Xenobiologist would also be a thoroughly brilliant Zoologist and a biologist
overall, not to mention Astronomy. Now you don't get to claim 'Unified Theory' and become an expert at
every field of science out there, but shy of that, this is what you need to become one of the top scientists
out there."
14,,100CP,Scientist: Machinery,Girl Genius,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You have a DOCTORATE! And skill in ACTUAL SCIENCE! That doesn't need you to go crazy to work!
Admittedly, it won't break the fabric of space and time, but meh. Tradeoffs everywhere you go. You're
highly trained in one field, and can easily apply its principles to your work. After all, building a crazed
abomination upon the natural order usually requires at least a smidgen of understanding of which bones
are supposed to go where (Even if you end up changing them around a little). At the very least, you're
also in the genius range of standard intelligence."
15,,100CP,Well Researched,Lords of the Night - Liches,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"The truth of the matter is that, no matter what you're doing, someone else was doing it before you.
People say, don't reinvent the wheel, but the wheel has been reinvented countless times. You are good
at avoiding having to reinvent things already made or discovered, though.
Your mind is like a steel trap. Not only do you never forget anything, you're good at instantly putting
everything you come across into context. This won't make you instantly cross-reference it with
something from a completely different context, but when you think on things and try to figure something
out, find a solution, or need something out of left field you can quickly scan across your entire body of
knowledge for something that could help.
This comes with you already being well studied on a huge range of topics, in this jump and all future
ones you go to. Think of it as roughly ten doctorates' worth of study on a wide range of subjects, with a
new set each new jump.
You can leave minds that might actually be greater than yours in the dust, as they try to achieve
something from first principles that was figured out by an obscure sage thirteen centuries ago, who only
ever put his findings down in a single journal that has been gathering dust in some corner of a minor
family library ever since."
16,,100CP,Enhanced Learning | Cuh-Ray-Zee! | Taunts | Weapon Swapping | Style: Trickster,Devil May Cry,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Enhanced Learning (100CP) Alright kid, you've been hitting the books and skipping parties to study like a
good little bookworm. Had to pay off sometime, right? Learning's as easy as breathing for you now, and
you can retain that information a lot easier than normal. You can walk into an Advanced Calculus
classroom and then walk out with the professor whimpering on the floor ten minutes later. I'm pretty
sure you'll be showing up other scientists in no time! But, uh, do try to go out more, alright? All that
textbook reading isn't gonna do wonders for your eyesight.
Cuh-Ray-Zee! (0CP) The moment you step into the world of Devil May Cry, you, and anyone you brought
with you, will have the innate potential to do incredibly amazing stuff all day long, pal. However, it will
take great skill and effort to pull off anything like blocking attacks with the back of your hand, or playing
an air guitar that actually produces audible sound for others to hear. But never fear, if you train hard
enough, and git gud enough, you too will be able to deflect bullets with other bullets, destroy buildings
by spouting out innuendos, and become a worthy disciple of my ways. And yes, you totally get to see
your rank whenever you're doing anything.
Taunts (0CP) Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelled of elderberries! You are able to come
up with witty dialogue, insults, jokes, and one-liners on the fly. Now, taunting does three very useful
things. First, it will boost your Style rating. I know, I know, that's amazing, and awesome, and all that.
Second, taunting pisses off your enemies. A lot. So much that they'll try to stomp your pretty little face
in. While this may seem like a bad thing, it can also be good for you, as the dumbass you're fighting will
make a mistake in their rage.
And thirdly, a successful taunt will help you get your game on and replenish your stamina. You won't be
able to run entirely on smack-talking suckers while you rip them a new rectal cavity, but it will definitely
ensure that you'll be able to fight for hours, sustained only by the power of your quips.
Weapon Swapping (0CP) The ability to swap between your weapons in the middle of battle. These
weapons are stored in a pocket dimension known only to you, and can be switched instantly with but a
thought.
Style: Trickster (0CP) Ah, Trickster Style, what a life saver you are. This here is the easiest style for
beginners, but don't go thinking that it's some sort of newbie exclusive deal.
Trickster allows you to quickly dash and dodge around enemy attacks in the blink of an eye, allowing you
to quickly weave away from their attacks and get behind them, strike from the blind spot, and then dash
away before they know what hit 'em. You can also do some sick wall running, dash while in the air, and
do a short-range teleport that'll either get you some breathing space, or put you right above your enemy,
ready to deliver a badass plunging attack"
17,,200CP,Living Library,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Won't ever have a need to study again, not for school and god be willing, not for life either. You've got a
quite literally perfect memory. You memorise anything on experiencing it with any of your senses once,
even for a flash. There is no limit to how much memory you can store at a time and even instantly recall
any information that you have memorised with no delay, as if you had already been thinking of it. Of
course, given that you've lived with this for years now, you've long since memorised a vast amount of
information, both academic, practical and trivial."
18,,200CP,Mad Genius,Buffy the Vampire Slayer SB,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You might not think that a world such as this, with great supernatural powers, would also have examples
of great technological genius, but it does. Greatly talented in the fields of science and technology, you
are specifically adept at a field of your choice, such as robotics, chemistry or biology, able to step well
beyond the limits of conventional science in that area. You could instead choose to specialize in
combining magic with technology. Additional purchases add an additional specialty"
19,,200CP,Methodical Approach,Lords of the Night - Liches,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Sometimes the best approach is plodding. It's like you have two extra minds. Not creative or innovative
like your normal thoughts, but absolutely patient, and never stopping, slowing, or growing bored.
If you need a material with a certain set of properties, they can go over everything you know about
material science and systematically work through it until they find such a material. If you need to make a
process more efficient, they can systematically go over all possible iterations, checking them one by one,
simplifying one way, then another, and another, seeing what works and what doesn't.
You always know how many steps you went up or down on a stairway, how long your stride was, how
many windows you passed, and other such points of data. This doesn't give you bottomless memory, but
the machine minds in the back of your head miss nothing, and can ponder anything and everything.
They can even outperform a more brilliant mind, because they never dismiss anything and leave no
stone unturned, even ones a more intuitive thinker would overlook. They excel at keeping the facts in
mind, and only the facts. What they lack in creativity or innovation they make up for in being utterly
systematic.
You also find it easier to work methodically through things with your normal thoughts, and when you do
you can work with the machine thoughts, using your intuition and creativity to help them overcome
problems and find solutions faster.
These extra thought trains always equal your normal ones in raw processing, but are otherwise crippled
as described above. However, they will take on weakened shadows of any mental or social enhancing
perks you possess.
For example, if you have the Social Intelligence perk, they will pick up on social data, and can work with
it despite not being creative or intuitive, processing through such data in bulk to help you solve larger
social questions. They won't be as capable as if you focused on those things with your normal thoughts,
but their methodical approach means they can handle bigger datasets then you can, and nothing stops
you from considering the ideas and thoughts they come up with your normal less restricted thought
processes."
20,,200CP,Muggle Technology,Make a Wish,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You know it, general knowledge of upto graduate level in every scientific field is known to you, not only
this, but the knowledge seems very eager to help you and as such whenever you are using magic for
creation of something or other, the knowledge will leap up with helpful facts and connect seemingly
disconnected facts to help in whatever magical creation you are making next. Post Jump, the helpfulness
and eagerness spreads to the rest of the knowledge you have in your mind."
21,,200CP,A Stroke of Genius,World of Tentacles,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"No matter where he goes or what he’s doing, an Evil Genius is almost always the smartest person in the
room, and probably the most perverted too. Your intelligence and creativity stand at the peak of
ordinary human capacity and your knowledge of the sciences is equally vast, covering many different
disciplines from robotics to programming to chemistry. Even magic is well within your grasp in any world
where such power can be learned. But when your genius is fueled by depraved inspiration you can push
these fields into the realm of comic book super-science. You might design machines that use orgasms to
brainwash their wearers or discover a new kind of energy produced by sexual desire. The laws of science
may seem hard and inflexible to others but in your hands they bend and flex like a stripper on a pole."
22,,200CP,Omni-Disciplinary,My Life As A Teenage Robot,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"When you're trying to create superpowered Robots, advanced machinery, or biological Monsters you
can't afford to stick to one field, and being a jack of all trades isn't quite enough either. This perk not only
gives you genius level knowledge in every scientific field as compared to the real world, but it also makes
it so none of your knowledge and ability will suffer from branching out in this way, in fact as you pursue
one field your knowledge in all the others will get a little clearer and easier to apply as your general
understanding of the universe expands."
23,,200CP,Pioneer,The Games We Play,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You're not just a scientist, you're a true innovator, a pioneer! You just don't know the meaning 'limits'. No
matter how much a science advances, how many discoveries or inventions are made, there is always the
next horizon, and you never fail to know how to start chasing it. You have an instinct for advancing any
fields you're interested in pursuing. Any failures are only new avenues to explore, and if all else fails, one
branch of study eventually leads into another. You have an unlimited imagination and innovation, being
able to tackle problems and questions in ways most people can't even imagine, let alone attempt. No
matter what you start on, you find yourself making new and varied advances if on a regular basis,
comprehending more and more as you go."
24,,200CP,Premier Education,Girl Genius SB,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"The Spark does a lot, but it helps to have the right education. Village Sparks working with chicken entrails
tend to die to pitchforks much more than city sparks working with sound principles. And now yours are
the soundest of them all! This perk provides you an incredible, unbelievably thorough, advanced and
extensive education in it, such that your knowledge and skills related to it are unquestionably along the
absolute best in the world. This world being what it is, the field in question can be anything from biology
to Space-Time analytics, Necromantic Construct Design and Engineering. The narrower the field the
better your understanding of it, but as an absolute minimum this perk would provide you a top of the
line, first class education like the kind you can get in Rome, Paris, Beetleburg or Castle Wulfenbach. You
can buy this perk any number of times for more fields to be educated in. Comes with fully acknowledged
Doctorates."
25,,200CP,Robotics,Rick And Morty,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You have spectacular ability in the fields of engineering and most notably robotics and find that making a
robot to pass the butter at the breakfast table is a viable alternative to getting up."
26,,200CP,The Ancients Wanted It Used,Hypno App Fantasia,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Why wouldn’t thousands of years old lost technology be in an easily understandable format that takes
only minutes to work out how to use? It’s almost like you think things are meant to be difficult here for
you or something. When it
comes to lost magic or technology, events align to make it simple for you to figure out how to use it and
all its little features. As long as the main purpose is for something lewd. Whether that’s on the original
technology or just your purposes, that’s what you’ll find so effortlessly easy to learn. The rest? If it’s
mostly perverted in purpose already, that stuff follows easily. Otherwise you’ll just find yourself
unnaturally talented and still need to put in some hard work. An ancient language might take a month to
decipher as opposed to years but the instructions to a variety of chemicals that alter the body in
perverted ways take just minutes to understand."
27,,200CP,Unusual Specialization,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"There are fields of knowledge and advancement that a person is renowned for, and it's usually for a
reason. You are now one of those people, a leading expert in something that the world looks to when
they have questions regarding it. Whether this is Gamma Radiation, or Wormhole Physics, or Modular
Design, or any one field of knowledge you deem fit so long as it would fit in this world. You may take this
perk multiple times if you wish."
28,,200CP,The Voice of Ingredients,Toriko,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Ingredients in the series somehow have a 'will' of sorts. Through currently unexplained phenomena,
there have been Ingredients in the series that seem to have a 'voice', which 'calls' for certain people and
'guides' them into how to prepare the Ingredient in question. People who possess the ability to hear the
Voice of Ingredients are shown to have an affinity towards Ingredients. The Ingredients also seem to
have 'preferences' for those that eat it as many believe that rather than a Chef choosing the Ingredients,
the Ingredients 'choose' the Chef. Those with Voice of Ingredients will find that ingredients that “speak”
to them always are the freshest or well aged, taste better then usual, and so on. This extends to other
worlds where ingredients don't have Voices."
29,,200CP,New World Mind,Rance 03,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Some people call you genius, others madman, few of them know the truth, that you have the mind of a
revolutionary designer. Weapons, castles, ships and other countless inventions. The moment you gaze
upon those constructions; you know how to improve their designs to make them better than the rest.
With the right conditions you could make them advance in a month what would take hundreds of years.
Then again, having the knowledge and being able to make it a reality are two different things."
30,,300CP,Mechanical Genius,Final Fantasy IV,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Your ability to understand machinery is on a different level entirely. Working with a metal you've never
touched to brace a machine? Cakewalk. New attachments on a precariously balanced airship? Might take
a day, less with an assistant. You know machines, and exactly how to calibrate them to your exact
specifications inherently without needing to actually run the numbers. It just works."
31,,400CP,Engineering Mastery IV,Essential Body Modification Supplement,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Learning speed increased by x1000, applies to design and fabrication fields. At this level, you can become
an Expert (equivalent of a college degree and a few years of experience) in an hour and a world-class
master in ten hours. See the Notes section of the Essential Body Mod Supplement for details on how
learning speed is modified by different factors."
32,,400CP,Genius-Level Intellect,Bleach - Reborn Remade,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"On par with the likes of Urahara, or Mayuri, you have an amazing intellect. Managing to reverse engineer
specialty soul products in short time periods (like the Squad 0 hotsprings), to accurately predict the exact
items you'll need for a battle before it begins."
33,,400CP,Genius,Fantastic Four,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"What can I say? You are one. You have a brain that leaves supercomputers, all the supercomputers
looking like an early 1900s adding machine. The speed at which your brain processes information is
legendary as is your sheer intelligence and inventiveness. You could pioneer entire branches of science in
your basement, or build equipment capable of affecting and manipulating the building blocks of the
universe with nothing but what you could find in an ordinary 21st century lab. Any and all designs and
items, be they technological or otherwise, leap for the chance to unveil their secrets to you, allowing you
to understand every detail with just a glance. And more than understanding them, you have an
instinctive gift for breaking such things down, improving them and copying stuff from one to the other.
Just... don't become useless, Jumper."
34,,400CP,Genius,Rick And Morty,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You may not be the Rickest of Ricks but you are the smartest person in your own universe. Your capacity
for invention is mind-boggling and even highly advanced alien civilizations barely hold a candle to you."
35,,400CP,Creatively Minded,Trials in the Tainted Space,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Geniuses might spend time in labs and clean environments, but there’s a saying: “necessity is the mother
of invention”. And you have a powerful affinity for using technology and materials in unorthodox ways.
You can strip parts from technology or combine things together to create useful tools or devices, or find
uses for materials that most wouldn’t consider, like using a giant horse dildo as a wire in a circuit, or
resetting a goo-girl made of repurposed nanobots so that you can use the medical nanobots as a healing
agent. You also have a gift for salvaging technology and devices for future use, or for getting technology
running again."
36,,400CP,Genius Intellect,Eureka-Warehouse 13-alphas,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You are one of the greatest minds to ever live. Well, that might be a touch hyperbolic, but you are most
definitely deserving of the title genius by local standards, which are higher than most. Your raw mental
processing, calculating, and problem solving ability is at least one, and usually several, orders of
magnitude above the common man. Try not to let it go to your head."
37,,400CP,Genius Researcher,I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"The gates of knowledge have been open to you since the first time you laid your eyes in the world and it
only grew closer to you since then. There's no exaggeration when saying that technology advanced 100
years with your contributions alone; from A.I. with will on their own, chips that can mind control people,
robotic limbs or weapons that can evade all the current security systems. There's no telling how much
you can develop with the right motivation and resources."
38,,400CP,Great Man,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"There's no dullards to be found here. You're a great mind and there's no doubt about it. A mind to match
the likes of Nikola Tesla or the other Great Men of these modern times, you have intelligence and
creative ability beyond any common man by far. Your knowledge of the sciences is vast, covering many
different fields to quite great depth.
One day you might work on plans to transform how the world sees energy, the next on weapons that
could rock the military world to its core. You're knowledge outside of the sciences is quite limited,
perhaps they never interested you as a child, but you do have two special qualities of your own.
Either way, you're a brilliant and creative man but the first special advantage is great talent for improving
and iterating upon the inventions of others. So long as another made it, you find yourself naturally
realising how and where it could be improved, finding it easy to accomplish these further developments
and even having some skill at taking the parts you like of a technology and applying them to something
else.
The other special trait you gain is to instead focus on the advancement of technology yourself, making
new technology comes far faster to you, especially if no one else has explored the present field. You'll
find the strange, the fantastical and the considered-impossible to be much easier for you to make
possible and even feasible. You can buy this perk again to gain the second benefit.
* Perk cost includes buying this twice."
39,,400CP,Info Processing,Starcraft II - Nova Covert Ops,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You are not always stuck in a lab, you are useful in more areas than just that. You can process
information, sensor readouts, intercepted communications, and more importantly, you can apply such
knowledge. While others would use such data for tactics, you see opportunity for scientific
advancement. The more information you have access to, the better opportunities you see for
salvageable materials, technologies, or data. And you can use those to relatively quickly implement a
usable and useful technology."
40,,400CP,Jack of All Trades,Andromeda,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Like Hohne you are a prodigy at learning all fields of science and engineering. Learning what would take
geniuses years in weeks. You can push the limits of science and engineering to new heights, but it will
still take time to learn everything that is out there.
Capstone Boosted: Master of all - You are now like Seamus Harper and can learn anything that would
take geniuses decades to learn in days. You can still learn non-scientific/engineering things in weeks or
months instead of years thanks to your impressive learning skills. Given enough time and knowledge
there is nothing you can not claim to be greatest in."
41,,400CP,Jeune Ecole,Honor Harrington,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"When it comes to building new and improved things, there is no one quite like you. You're a genius
among geniuses. While your skills cover a large spectrum, you specialize in communications and
weapons, being able to design systems and weaponry decades in advance of your closest peers.
While this perk provides you no help when it comes to making whole ships or shipyards, within your field
you're practically unmatched. You could take a normal design and come up with a hundred new ideas,
and they will all be completely feasible ideas that will actually be massively helpful to your side. Getting
them produced may be expensive and time consuming, but once they're ready they will be decades
ahead of the curve."
42,,400CP,Leading Light,DCEU,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You've got the brawn already, now it's time for you to get some brains. There are few minds like yours on
Earth, as you're smart enough to produce an incredible array of advanced technology if you put your
mind to it. You've got an in depth knowledge on almost every field of science there is and know how to
turn that knowledge into working technology, such as the devices and vehicles that Batman uses to fight
crime with. You're even able to, with a lot of time and effort, reverse engineer alien technology. It'll
probably take a few months to do so without some seriously high tech laboratories but it's not out of
your reach. If you just want to figure out how some alien tech works, it shouldn't take you more than a
few minutes though."
43,,400CP,Life or Death,Subnautica,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"They laughed when you studied the life sciences, but you'll show them! You are now an expert chemist
and virologist, capable of whipping up dangerous mixtures on command. Toxic warheads, advanced
medkits, and poisons capable of killing Leviathans are now in your mind's eye. You'll need access to
various chemical sources, but I'm sure you'll find what you need if you keep your scanner out."
44,,400CP,Like a Robot,Invincible,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Your mind is a masterpiece. You think faster than a normal human being; you can process in a second
what would have before taken you a minute. You have the ability to split your mind in twain to
concentrate on more than one thing at a time. In the beginning you would be limited to dividing your
mind into 10 different streams of thought, each of which has the full processing power of your entire
mind. Given time however, something on the scale of decades, you will be able to split your mind
exponentially more, giving you enough subdivisions to run the world, control an army, and a police force
of millions of separate robot suits all the while manipulating global politics. Given even more time, who
knows how far you could take this."
45,,400CP,Mad Geneticist,Rick And Morty,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Sometimes science is more art than science and you find that this is doubly true when it comes to
genetics. When you have a vague idea of the attributes you want to impart from a species you find them
remarkably easy to splice into a different species. It won't even backfire that often. Probably. Be careful."
46,,400CP,Master of Engineering,Dishonored 2,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Within your lofty cranium rests a mind the likes of which only appears once or twice a generation. Ideas
dance through your mind like brilliant fireflies all you have to do is reach out and grasp them. Visions of
whirling gears and pumping oil; of lightning bottled in cages of glass and copper; of crystal lenses and
formulas that write themselves...the spark of invention drives you to produce marvels ahead of their
time - indeed with effects that seem to outstrip the technology of the device itself. Build a combat
automaton from cogs and steel, record whole conversations on a single punch card, devise security
systems which can recognise specific people, all these and more. If you merely had the funding and the
time to refine these visions into physical form, you could unleash your marvels onto the world and you,
too, could be spoken of in the same breath as Sokolov, Roseborrow, and Jindosh."
47,,400CP,Modern Insight,God Catching Alchemy Meister,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"One of the greatest advantages of humanity in this world and the best weapon for any alchemist:
creativity. The wonders of the mind, the imagination that eventually lead to dreams becoming reality.
For a creator has no better tool than his own mind, and yours is a well of ideas without end. Each
meeting, each view is but a mountain of new ideas forming in your mind, each better than the last.
When it comes to innovation, your works are assured to be the best around. Now, you only need enough
time, materials and skill to make those dreams a reality."
48,,400CP,Omega-Level Intellect,Doctor Who,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"By taking this perk you have become one of the most brilliant entities to ever exist. You now have a mind
fit to shake the universe, one that even the greatest intellects of an entire race of hyper-intelligent
beings with a unique perception of time, space, and reality would be forced to acknowledge as a peer...
or more. You are able to dismiss as trivially easy the sort of challenges that lesser geniuses would
consider their life's masterwork. You have essentially no limits on what you can comprehend, design, or
build except available knowledge, resources, and time... and the inherently hard limits of whatever
reality you might happen to be in, of course. Although even those can be bent, if not broken. This perk
does not grant you any knowledge you don't already have but from now on there will never be anything
that you cannot comprehend with sufficient effort. It won't always be easy, it might take more than
mortal lifetimes of study and research to unravel the truly fundamental mysteries of existence, and for
things on Jump-Chan's level or higher 'sufficient effort' is defined as 'post-Spark'... but your intellect is
now potentially infinite. Technology of all kinds, no matter how advanced, yields its secrets to you with
barely a glance at the relevant bits and this type of learning speed carries over in all other fields of
expertise. Your mind is a quicksilver-brilliant thing, capable of computations and interpolations that leave
the finest computers in the galaxy, any galaxy, looking like an abacus being operated by a chimpanzee.
Your capacity for multitasking is similarly scaled, making you capable of things like flawlessly solo piloting
an infinitely complex spaceship that would normally take half a dozen geniuses to operate and other
minor tricks of similar kind."
49,,400CP,Quick study,Factorio,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"So much to learn, so little time. You absorb new information at a ridiculous rate, retain it perfectly, and
can recall anything on a moment's notice. Your optimized mental processing vastly increases your
intelligence, and offers protection against drugs, damage, or other things that would impair your mind or
tamper with your memories."
50,,400CP,Scientific Mastery IV,Essential Body Modification Supplement,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Learning speed increased by x1000, applies to scientific fields. At this level, you can become an Expert
(equivalent of a college degree and a few years of experience) in an hour and a world-class master in ten
hours. See the Notes section of the Essential Body Mod Supplement for details on how learning speed is
modified by different factors."
51,,400CP,Technician,Alpha Centauri,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Learning has become easier for you now, especially in the field of natural science and engineering, you
absorb and retain information like a sponge and can mix and match theory and experience with much
greater skill."
52,,400CP,The Crazed Toymaker,Revelation Space,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"In the time of readily-available high technology and smart fabrication, there are two qualities that win
fights: Overwhelming firepower, and pure deviousness. I can't speak for the former, but of the latter you
seem to have an inexhaustible supply. Designing and building deadly trinkets is your forte, little horrific
nick-knacks that kill not through big booms but through precision, trickery and the sheer
unexpectedness of their nature. From tiny disguised drones with neurotoxin injectors, spider mines,
hyperfilament snare-webs and crabbers, all the way up to ship- killing photon-sails and proximity
limpets, you are never lacking the inspiration to invent a new, deadly toy specially designed to slip
through your enemies' defenses and rip their hearts out."
53,,400CP,The Very Model of a Scientist Salarian,Mass Effect,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You've studied species turian, asari and batarian (and more). You're quite good at genetics (as a subset of
biology) because you are an expert (which you know is a tautology). Your xenoscience studies range from
urban to agrarian, you are the very model of a scientist salarian. Can sing a little. Little you cannot give
insight into due to your vast range of knowledge. Little that you have a hard time getting into due to your
vast starting base. You could brute-force the vast majority of ""impossible"" scientific endeavors in this
world with your relentless application of logic."
54,,400CP,Xenobiologist,DOOM 3,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"The denizens of hell are equally terrifying and magnificent, in their own way. You have been extensively
trained in the biological sciences, yet even your understanding is merely a starting point for these
strange beings. Superhuman strength and resilience, the ability to manifest and control confined plasma
charges, teleportation you don't know how they do it. But you will. Your talents grant you immense
insight into any biological system, and through study and research, you'll eventually be able to
understand even the most bizarre and alien biologies and, with enough skill, even replicate them. Hell is
the way forward, and you intend to study it every step of the way.
This Perk grants you a 50CP stipend which you may use in the Mysteries Of Mars or Hell's Might sections
found further in this document."
55,,400CP,Exemplar,Girl Genius SB,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Indeed, it might be an understatement. You’re now… more, Jumper. More than what you were and more
than what any mortal can be. While the most evident and powerful effects of this perk are seen in
Sparks, no beings can go entirely unaffected by something like this. Firstly, you are now the absolute
peak of everything you can be. Human, dragon, clank or Jäger, you’re unquestionably among the ten
finest specimens of your kind in existence. Indeed, this perk, in addition to paying the full 800 CP price
above, would let you even be an extra-dimensional being like a Dreen or somesuch, limited by and large
only by your own imagination. But that aside, you’re the finest, most capable beings of your kind
anywhere out there. Physically, mentally… in every way that counts, your actions come across as deeper,
more important, your everything screams of something that defies any and all mortal limits. Indeed,
none apply to you now. Any limits on your training, physical capacity, mental enhancements… any limits
on anything relating to you ceases to exist. You can grow without end, continuing in an endless growth
regardless of how much or how little sense it might make.
Exemplar Boosted: Your talents with the sparks cross the basic boundaries all the way, transforming you
into something altogether beyond. You have had the second breakthrough, the transformation that
makes you from a Spark into true Spark Royalty! You are like one of the Immortal God-Queens of old, of
which only a precious few remain today.
You’re not a fully grown, matured God-Spark like Albia, but you’re further along than Agatha or Lord
Snackleford. Along with having psychic powers like levitation and telepathy, you can release blasts of
pure energy to scour your foes from the earth. You can see in more than three dimensions, and even
interact with beings beyond the mortal plane in several ways. You have the power to shapeshift freely,
going from giant to normal in an instant, and acquiring any colour, appearance or form you desire.
You can possess willing subjects, and break any mind control or subversion on your subjects. You can
control energy in various forms, most of them rather unspecified. Most importantly, of course, your
talents with actual Sparking transcend any ordinary sparks entirely, being almost as much beyond them
as they are beyond mundane scientists. You have a surfeit of ideas, almost as if you can do anything! You
don’t even need to bother with Madness Places very much anymore, that is, being ‘Suspended in an
Eternal Moment of Supreme Clarity’. You do retain your ability to scare lesser minds out of their skin just
by talking.
Oh, and you gain a rotating Halo of any symbols of your choice, turning around your head in an endless
circle. Basically, you have somewhat weaker versions of any powers displayed by Albia, even those not
mentioned here. And you would grow to match her as soon as you acquire enough experience. You can
hide the obvious bits of this, but why would you want to?"
56,,500CP,Mega Attributes: Intelligence,Trinity: Aberration,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Outperform even the most advanced supercomputer clusters. You receive one of the following
Enhancements for free:
Taint resistance: Your grey matter is extremely durable. Any form of insanity you had before eruption is
healed, and neural dysfunction as a result of Node growth will be greatly reduced. Your brain will also be
far better at self-repair and working around injuries or drugs that impair mental functions.
Analyze Weakness: Nothing is perfect, and you can easily identify flaws in what you can observe. This
requires at least a basic understanding of the mechanics behind something, but you are otherwise not
limited in what this Enhancement can apply to. Anything from structures to complex systems to
bureaucratic procedures.
Mental Prodigy: You naturally grok a particular field of study. Learning new skills, making advancements
and intuitive leaps within this area comes easily to you. Your chosen field might be anything from a
specific scientific field like engineering or medicine, finance, forensic science or military tactics."
57,,500CP,Scientist | Elder Immortal,UQ Holder,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Elder Immortal (300CP) Not some young thing anymore, are you? No, you've been here for quite a
while. Centuries in fact. Instead of starting as a hot blooded youth, just coming into their immortal life,
you'll begin as an immortal who has already been present in this world for several hundred years. While
this has certainly given you a wealth of background memories, provided you chose to have any, the main
effect this has is that it has boosted certain perks to account for centuries of use, practice and study.
These perks will be marked with an (EI) in their title and their effects will be described in a second
paragraph below the main perk description. If you choose a Demihuman option that has powers of it's
own, Elder Immortal will also give similar levels of skill and experience with them as it would do the
perks and immortality options.
Scientist (200CP) The power that you need is all there in your head already. The many disciplines of
science and academics became your swords and spells to use against your foes. With a brilliant mind
able to keep up with humanity's best, you've taken on a very wide degree of learning in a variety of
different fields. Enough that even without specialising in a specific study, you can do things like creating
combat capable robots, jetpacks, laser weapons, short ranged teleports and a variety of other devices
able to mimic lower strength magic.
Focusing on one field in particular might let you threaten a moderately strong wizard or fighter with your
creations. You do need to put in the time and resources to create things however. With this, you'll start
with a few decent creations to help you in battle, such as some capable firearms and armor or a
powerful robotic assistant you created.
Elder Immortal Boost Centuries of study, research and cribbing from every other genius you can have left
you quite the astounding genius. Your mind boosted into the stratosphere by training and
enhancements, it's allowed you to come to be close or even an equal to legends like Chao herself. With
enough time and money, there is little that is impossible for you to create through science. Time and
dimension travel, space elevators to connect Earth and Mars, machines or cyborg bodies capable of
destroying entire cities. It's all possible, though some can still be pretty time consuming, and choosing to
specialise will greatly aid your speed and talent."
58,,600CP,9.3TB Equation,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Being synched to a Valkyrie Core enhances your mental abilities allowing you to quickly process the large
amounts of information generated from the battlefield. With this perk this mental boost is increased
allowing you to process vast amounts of data or become practically omniscient in the local area with the
right sensors. Even when desynched to your Valkyrie Core your mental abilities will be boosted although
to a lesser extent. You also learn new skills and abilities slightly quicker in addition to not worrying about
having a stroke from trying to process too much data at once."
59,,600CP,A Spark of Genius,Girl Genius SB,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Or you might be an absolute, incomparable genius in general, I guess. While anyone who takes the
Scientist Origin may be a weak spark if they wish to, this is where you go for the good stuff. You now
have, and thus are, one of the strongest Sparks on the planet now, an absolute, blazing genius like
Agatha Heterodyne,either of the Wulfenbachs, Dr Vapnoople, or others at the same tier.
The Spark, that something that makes the wonders of this world possible, is plugged into your mind and
soul, inflaming it, filling it with a fire that boosts your mental facilities to unbelievable extents such that
many things that should be impossible... suddenly aren't. While you specialise in some field to
extraordinary degrees, like being able to create artificial sparks if you choose 'Von Neumann Clanks',
your genius is unbound by the petty concerns lesser sparks suffer from, allowing you to shine equally
bright in every field from Microbiology to Trans-Dimensional Aeronautics.
You have an instinctive grasp for scientific principles, can reverse engineer technology more or less just
from seeing it, and have a head for calculation and numbers that defies belief. You can decrypt data in
your head, have a completely flawless memory, and are in general the quintessential Mad Scientist.
Complete with a gift for cackling and rants that can terrify anyone who isn't, by the way.
When in the Madness Place, especially, you have an outright effect that allows you to warp time and
space in a small area around you, letting you do weeks' worth of work in hours, and outright warp, twist,
spindle the mutilate the very laws of physics as you craft your wonders... and horrors. Apart from the
SCIENCE!, you have a charisma that borders on mind control, as anyone without a spark, or an
exceptionally strong willpower is drawn into your orbit by your sheer force of will, ready to help and
serve wherever they can. Your body is also somewhat better than most, allowing you to go all those allnighters
without food and fight off highly trained fighters while barely paying attention.

60,,600CP,Brain the Size of a Planet,Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You are now possessed of a brain that is, metaphorically speaking, the size of a planet. How it fits in your
head is anyone's guess, but it's big enough to store quintillions of years of memories flawlessly, instantly
recall anything you've ever seen, heard, thought, dreamed, imagined, or learned, never degrade, and
output it into any format you can conceive of. Not only that, but you can deliberately forget anything
you've ever learned... and be perfectly aware you've deleted it... and undelete it later if you feel like it,
though you can never be compelled to do that last. You could even schedule it to undelete itself at some
later date. Anyone attempting to access your memory without your permission is liable to get lost in the
nigh-infinite maze of idle wonderings or catalogues of all the itches you've ever had and never be heard
from again. Of course, a brain isn't only for memorizing things, and so you've now got the equivalent
mental processing power of one hundred billion genius level human beings. Does not come with
crippling depression about how small the thought processes of mere mortals are."
61,,600CP,Comic Book Science,DC Multiverse - Earth 11,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You're extremely intelligent, easily one of the smartest people on the planet. You could build a massive
company from scratch and revolutionize the sciences if you so choose. Your genius allows you to
remember everything you've ever seen in great detail, hold multiple trains of thought at once, pick up
new information and master skills very quickly, and build futuristic technology that seems to ignore
conventional physics. Intellectually, you rival Lex Luthor and Ms. Terrific."
62,,600CP,First Thinker,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Now we're getting somewhere. Among your particular species, you're a revolutionary one-of-a-kind
mind that calling you a genius would be severely downplaying your potential impact on the universe. You
are a paragon of knowledge and technology among your kind, to the point when they say 'on the
shoulders of giants' you are very much that giant. A human at this level could advance the technology
level of Earth by a dozen levels in less a few years, while a Galvan with this level would be one of the few
minds Azmuth would call an equal. Whatever the case, you know how to innovate and advance
technology light years ahead of the norm, elevating your species potentially millennia ahead of where
they are now. Things like faster than light travel, laser weapons, completed starships and techno-organic
constructs? For many, those things are groundbreaking and new. For you, they're only the tip of what
you can accomplish."
63,,600CP,Genius Intellect,Young Justice,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Despite your apparent age, you possess one of the greatest minds that the world has ever seen. Your
ability to come up with ideas and invent is nearly unparalleled, and actually building your inventions is
child's play. What's more, your inventions have a lot more room in terms of following conventional
physics; you can create things like teleportation devices, collars that nullify superpowers, and more."
64,,600CP,God Father,Supergod,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Impressive as they are, the Super Gods were made by human hands. For all their great powers, they
originated with human ingenuity. Great minds like yours are what created these beings. You are
incredibly intelligent, among the greatest minds humanity has ever seen, and the foremost expert in the
entire world on a specific kind of science. Biology, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, whatever you
chose to be centuries ahead of the rest of the world in is what you are currently working on a project to
create a Super God from. With your experience, you are especially skilled at creating monsters out of
your chosen field of science but even outside of that purpose, you are absurdly skillful in creating
effective technologies based on your choice."
65,,600CP,Legendary Master- Intellectual,Rimworld,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You're an expert at research and scientific advancement of all kinds. There is no technology beyond your
capability for reverse-engineering or eventually decoding. So long as you have a clear goal in mind for
the development of a piece of tech you can eventually manufacture it. All research work you complete is
not only doubled but is also impossibly easy to understand to even the most simple-minded luddite.
With your blueprints even a group of tribal humans could find the stars within their grasp. Sidenote:
actually doing so is another story altogether."
66,,600CP,Malkuth Theory,The Games We Play,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You possess the greatest power of all, that of the human mind, ever seeking knowledge and
understanding. Your mind, scientific ability and sheer talent are like something out of a legend, and a
terrifying one at that.You're a genius on a level that leaves the greatest of geniuses despairing at their
unworthiness. Forget the greatest minds of this age, the very Archangels and their creators would have
found themselves jealous of the sheer ease with which sciences of all kinds and colors come to you,
nature almost eager to reveal its secrets. You start out at the limit of this era's understanding of science,
with what amounts to a degree in everything, but worry not, the vast and wondrous creations of the
Angels and Archangels are far from being beyond your reach, with it being only a matter of time before
you reach the same levels in them. After this world you don't get any knowledge ex-nihilo, but your skills
translate perfectly to all branches of study you ever encounter, providing you equal talent and potential."
67,,600CP,One in a Trillion,Infinite Stratos,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Only one other person in the world possesses the grand level of intelligence you now find yourself in
possession of, Tabane Shinonono. Comparing you to any sort of normal human mind would be a joke,
because you're decades ahead of the rest of the world. You think faster, better and so far outside the box
they'd need to measure in miles. You don't know anything more than you do right now but with a mind
like this, it'll be a matter of weeks before you're zooming past the experts and making the beginnings of
something special. Mighty robots, dimensional pockets, space flight and true artificial intelligence are all
just the beginning."
68,,600CP,Over-Science,How A Realist Hero Rebuilt The Kingdom,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"A genius. That's what you are. Your creativity, thinking outside the box and intelligence are comparable
to greatest minds of history like Da Vinci or, in this world, to Maxwel. While you aren't someone to make
spaceships with the current technology of this world, your creations are more than enough to bring a
new industrial revolution to the continent. That's it, as long as you can produce and market your
inventions."
69,,600CP,Philosopher Scientist,Grant Morrison's 18 Days,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"In the Silver Age, the Great Sage Vishwamitra decreed that Trishanku (born Satyavrata of the Solar
Dynasty), the King of Ayodhya, was to be let into heaven with his mortal body. When denied this by the
gods, Vishwamitra crafted a new heaven for Trishanku to rule over as the new Indra. Only the
beseechments by the gods prevented this from becoming reality.
You are not quite the equal of Vishwamitra, for he was a giant among men even in the Days of Silver. But
you are among the closest that exist in this base era. Yours is the mastery of all the sciences and arts of
the world, from the biological expertise to the chemical and the magical, needed to craft all the wonders
and miracles that exist in this time and place.
With this blessing your intelligence, speed of thought, and aptitude towards any and all fields of science
and magic both are heightened to tremendous, absurd degrees. Your memory is limitless and
unalterable, and your ability to recall it instant and flawless. You can think and do any number of things
at once, possessing truly unlimited multitasking.
Combined with Yajnatek, you will be able to summon and bind gods, lay down bindings of fate in the
forms of boons and curses, craft great works of magic that make and break empires, and more. At the
same time, your scientific aptitude would let you craft gadgets and wonders like the Vimanas, Godly
weapons and armor any deity or Super warrior would be proud to wield, or even wonders like the Rishi
Computer Markandeya, or even works like the Maya Mahal, the palace of wonders from where Yudish
once ruled.
You can also combine any and all of your gifts, crafting together technology, psionics and magic into
works that can do anything either can, as well as machines to cast magic, and others that combine the
best of both worlds to achieve even greater results."
70,,600CP,Sane Science,Superman the Animated Series,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Biology, chemistry, engineering and physics are your tools. Progress is your purpose. With your intellect
and enough time and resources there is nothing you can't accomplish. From cloning to robotics,
nanotech to hard light, computer programming to space travel, anything is within your reach."
71,,600CP,The Art and Science,Endless Pantheon,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Magic and Science, two sides of the same coin. You are a master of both, now. You are a genius without
peer, skilled almost beyond comparison at any and all forms of 'book' learning. Your skills in magic equal
that of the best Wizards of the White Council, and your skills at Science are comparable to those of the
finest scientists among the goa'uld, and they only grow from here. You learn in hours and days what
others need months for, be it languages, branches of science or schools of magic. You're also extremely
good at teasing the maximum possible efficiency out of things, be they technology or magic, such that
your spells have refinement and precision virtually unmatched. This can be both practical, such as using
super-fine lasers where others would use torrents of flame, or in terms of your long term work, such as
software that you can write utilizing unbelievably little resources to be extraordinarily effective and
robust."
72,,600CP,The Ever Expanding Tree,Stellaris,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Science is something that people do not think of very much, in their minds it is almost like magic, simply
looking into something and after an undisclosed amount of time, poof! You however know that is not
how Science works, you know that it is a doctrine for which to follow when one wishes to understand
the Universe safely and efficiently. You have mastered this doctrine, and because of it your ability to
discover new technological heights is virtually infinite allowing you to continually discover more and
more technologies without any limit. To add to this you can even branch out seemingly useless pieces of
technology into something completely unfathomable. For example you could use the basis for a toaster
to create a giant space station that superheats planets. While this may seem almost fantastical, the
general rules of research still apply, and because of this you must still conduct actual research and
experiments."
73,,600CP,The Mind,Megamind,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Ah, the good stuff. You arrive from the same planet from Megamind unless you don't. Either way, just
like him you are a grade-A, five star genius on a comic book level, unmatchable and brilliant by all. Not
only can you create things like invisible vehicles, death rays lasers and illusion generators, you are also a
genius of the equal degree in all other fields, finding it just as easy to bioengineer a fish into sapience as
to build a huge robot. Moreover, you can do all this on your typical city-level mostly unsuccessful villain's
resources. You can get by with even the most limited or inferior resources, even if you might end up
making wheels out of bent license plates now and then. You're particularly good at making tech that
interacts with superpowers, be it replicating them, recreating them with samples from the holder, or
boosting, weakening or even disabling them."
74,,600CP,The New Doctor Bowman,Freefall,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You've read the works of Feynman, Newton, Einstein, and John Von Neumann and honestly, they don't
hold a candle to you. Your brilliance is such that in most every field of study you can easily become a
household name and when you choose a particular discipline it really shines through. Even if you
managed to keep your personal details and identity secret, what you've created will not just be
mentioned in history books but may become a defining point in history. Works well to increase your
learning speed as well as enhance effects of other perks that increase both general intelligence and
knowledge of specific fields of study."
75,,600CP,Urkel's Intellect,Family Matters,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"You are beyond brilliant. With a standard public school education and the resources of a middle-class
teenager, you could invent technologies that previously only existed in science fiction. The best way to
describe your mental prowess is to say that you are a comic-book genius, potentially capable of inventing
technology to allow cloning, neural downloads, teleportation, shrink rays, genetic manipulation, or even
time travel. What is more, you possess the same level of ability in all sciences and technologies that you
put any effort into, whether it be computers, robotics, biology, chemistry, physics or any other. Any gains
made in one area are equalled in those other fields."
76,,600CP,Virology,Prototype,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Looking at it from a technical standpoint, viruses are just devices that carry genes, they enter the
nucleus, insert their genome, and then the host cell does everything else for them. This characteristic
makes viruses one of the most favored devices in genetic engineering, as they can go and infect multiple
cells. The folks at Gentek know this, and focus solely on them, but you have a leg up on them. By
extensive study (but still far less than a computer could) you can decode the entire genome of a lifeform,
and decode and isolate the genes responsible for any and every trait that they possess. Want the
eyes of a goat on the body of a snake? Or possibly just the strength of a rhinoceros? Do not look away,
study and decode today!"
77,,600CP,Wakeman Tech,My Life As A Teenage Robot,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"This perk gives you the ability to create technology on par with that made by the esteemed Nora
Wakeman. At a base this gives you a unique talent for making absurdly efficient technology that can
reshape itself and compress down into impossibly small shapes and sizes. With enough time and study
you can replicate anything she ever built or equivalents to them, including XJ-Units."
78,,600CP,We're Going To Change The World Peter,Spider-Man PS4,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"Few are the men that can look down on the world like you do. Your mind is one of those that will be
looked back on in centuries time as one of the greatest in history. You have all the potential to change
the world with your intelligence. Create a cure for cancer, true cybernetic bodies, unlock the secrets of
turning matter to pure energy or creating true space flight.
They'll likely take years of work but you well and truly can change the world. But why cure cancer when
you can make superheroes and monsters instead? You might have a world class mind but you also have
truly superb talent for creating technology meant to interact with super powers. Giving, taking or
altering the superhuman powers found in this world.
Making a man have the powers of a spider or creating a monstrous symbiote superweapon or sealing the
negative powers of a poor young child. Even technology meant to enhance, weaken or otherwise
interact with these powers is within your grasp. While you have no experience with magic, you might
perhaps learn to apply some principles from your work here to that field too."
79,,1000CP,And Where to Find Them | You Have Been Reborn,Invincible,Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence,"And Where To Find Them (600CP) You are beyond all doubt a super genius. You are a creative and
intuitive genius that could build futuristic projects, make armours capable of fighting veteran Viltrumites
to a standstill and reverse engineer or better alien technologies that are centuries more advanced than
you are. You are also quite skilled at cloning technologies and enhancing normal people far beyond their
original limits through cybernetics, genetic modification and incredibly sophisticated gear.
Without a doubt you are one of the most intelligent individuals in the world, with a knack for the
physical and mass production sides of science. While you can go beyond the more physical sciences, it
may take you about fifteen years to properly create a time travel device or a device that would allow you
to hop between universes.
Capstone Boosted: Screw being one of the smartest beings on the planet you are without a doubt the
smartest being on the planet. Master time travel technology, hop between universes before brunch,

want to reverse engineer your tech.
You Have Been Reborn (400CP) You have somehow been caught in a time machine accident, and have
been reconstituted with molecules from millions of years in the future. Thanks to this you have become
better than you once were, far better.
You have gained slightly beyond peak human physical and mental attributes, and neither your body or
skills ever degrade in any way due to the passing of time or lack of exertion. Given time and effort you
could easily win the entire Olympics if you'd like, break world records daily, become the greatest Chess
Master in the world, these are all now possible for you. Beyond this however you have gained a minor
ability to use Telekinesis. Able to use Telekinesis to lift a maximum of 10 lbs currently, though should you
train enough this ability will quickly grow seemingly without limit. Given a year or two, you might be able
to lift houses with no effort.
More than this however these future atoms seem to have had an interesting effect on your existing
abilities and will operate as a Capstone Booster on all capstones."
