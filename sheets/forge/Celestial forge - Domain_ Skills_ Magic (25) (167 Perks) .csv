1,,0CP,Magic Powers ,Generic Magical Girl,Domain: Skills: Magic,"For the most part, this ought to be left up to the imagination, but if you took one of the powered origins - Animal Mascot, Deadly Sin, Mahou Shoujo, or Monster - you now possess a small amount of magical power. 
As a Mahou Shoujo, you possess a transformation sequence, which grants strength and speed on par with an olympic athlete. While this is active, you also possess a handful of attacks and a wand weapon, as well as a weak magical shield. As a Deadly Sin, you do not technically possess a sequence, as you gain the power to keep it active 100% of the time. While active - which is always - you possess similar powers to the Mahou Shoujo, but you sacrifice practically all your defenses for increased firepower. 
As a Animal Mascot, you do not possess a sequence. In fact, you don’t have any direct offensive magic at all. You have a limited ability to heal, and a few ‘status effects’ spells, such as sleep or short term amnesia. The kind of thing that might be referred to as ‘white’ magic."
2,,100CP,Tantric Recharge | Carnal Artist ,Generic Hentai Superheroes,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Spells low on power? Running out of that mojo? A quick romp in the hay will fix that for you. Now, sex restores your mana, based on how powerful the person you had sex with is. This will lead them slightly drained. 
Basic: You can detect the magic inside of people and objects.Choose an element to manipulate through magic. It doesn’t have to be one of the four classic elements. 
Carnal Artist (World of Tentacles) (FREE)
Sex is a lot less fun when you don’t know what you’re doing, and that’s just as true for tentacle monsters as for anyone else. This perk gives you a built-in instinct for sex and eroticism and a mastery of related bedroom skills. Even if you were a blushing virgin before this jump, having this perk will give you an instinct and talent for pleasing your partners; whether you’re trying to bring a girl off by milking her tits or leave her hanging on the edge of orgasm for hours on end, you’ll be able to pull it off."
3,,100CP,Tentacles on Demand ,Submission Sailor Moon,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The perfect thing for when you need to tie up a struggling prisoner, this set of tentacles can be summoned out of most flat surfaces, allowing them to hang from the ceiling or rise up from the ground whenever you need a few extra pairs of limbs. The tentacles are about six to ten feet long and have all the strength and abilities that your own limbs do, like shapeshifting or spewing poison, but if they’re damaged or destroyed you’ll have to wait 24 hours to summon them again. You get six tentacles per purchase and can purchase this item multiple times to get additional tentacles, though Youma only get discounts on the first purchase. "
4,,100CP,The Magic Touch ,Evening Starter,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Guess what, Jumper, you’re a Wizard! Well — you can use magic, anyway. With the aid of tomes, sorcery emulators, or other foci, you can draw upon the powers both ancient and possibly dark in order to cast a variety of spells and curses. "
5,,100CP,Big And Shiny ,Fate/Horse Order,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Servants are such odd beings, are they not? The powers they are summoned with, the way they look, sometimes even their damn gender can be drawn not from what is true, but what people remember about them. Or even what they’d rather look like instead of what they were actually like. As such, you can now modify the appearances of anything you happen to summon, servant or otherwise. Something simple like ‘as drawn by a different artist’ would be the limits for the time being, but if you spend a great deal of time practicing you might be able to one day get their gender wrong on purpose. For now, your summons will simply have a tendency to come out a bit taller and curvier. "
6,,100CP,Magic and Mayhem ,World of Tentacles,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Even an untested demon princeling possesses a talent for magic but some learn to augment the power of their spells by fuelling them with their perverse desires. Any magical powers you have become noticeably more powerful and flexible when used for lewd ends. For instance a standard fireball spell could become half again as powerful as a normal one if you intend to incinerate a heroine’s clothing while also doing so without inflicting unwanted harm on the target herself. This applies to all sorts of magic: from summoning rituals that call forth tentacle monsters to molest your foes, to traps that seal enemies in leather and chain and latex, and even to healing spells that cleanse unpleasant illnesses and infections. "
7,,100CP,Magical... Boy? ,Generic Hentai Magical Girl,Domain: Skills: Magic,"So, while you might expect that the magic here only works on women, seeing as how 100% of the magical girls are, well, girls, that no longer applies to you. You can, in fact, be a magical boy. Spells and techniques that should only work on one gender work on you regardless, as do armor and weapons. Won’t let you walk into the girls locker room as a guy though, but you could make a cheerleader outfit look amazing. "
8,,100CP,Master of the Elements ,Lewd Magic Isekai,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Elemental magic is some of the most basic tools in a wizard’s arsenal, from fireballs and lightning bolts to gusts of wind and shields of earth. But for all that it’s very basic stuff, a skilled mage needs to learn how to contain the damage he causes, harming only the targets he intended and avoiding collateral damage. You have mastered the elements of earth, fire, wind, water, as well as similar elements like lightning and ice magic. Your skills in this field are impressive, not only ensuring that you can defend yourself in battle with all manner of elemental magics but being able to do so with such skill that your spells never inflict damage on anything you didn’t intend to hit. Your fireballs could sear the flesh off of a company of orcs without harming a hair on an innocent elf trapped in their midst, even if you didn’t know she was there. "
9,,100CP,Natural Aptitude ,eratohoK,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You have a natural skill with magic. This immediately opens up the mystical powers of the magic section (see the Abilities section for more detail). You may, with time and practice, possibly even enlighten someone else in the ways of magic. "
10,,100CP,The Potential ,Bible Black,Domain: Skills: Magic,"While anyone can learn how to use magic, you have a special talent in it. Magic just comes easy for you. In fact, it’s so easy that you already start out with your capabilities unlocked. Any magic you wish to learn in the future will be easier for you to both understand and perform (twice the average for that setting). "
11,,100CP,Black and White ,Bible Black,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Normally, you would have to study years to gain the knowledge being gifted to you here. While you aren’t a master of the occult, you are not a novice either. This gives you vast knowledge in both black and white magic and rituals. Black magic tends to be more offensive with its rituals requiring sacrifices of blood, sex, and life in order to accomplish. White magic is more defensive, with the banishment of demons and the healing of ailments being a focus. Rituals of white magic are often long chanting sessions and rather time-consuming. "
12,,100CP,Cleaning Spell ,Winger’s World,Domain: Skills: Magic,"In a world like Winger’s, there is bound to be a ton of messes. This makes it much easier to clean up. While most messes will be completely removed, you can also choose to instead move them to prepared containers. Perfect for harvesting energy after a massive orgy. "
13,,100CP,I Can Read Your Aura,Eureka-Warehouse 13-Alphas,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Everyone has an Aura, and being able to sense them allows you insight into a person's mental and emotional state. Incidentally, Artefacts also have an Aura, and the ability to sense them allows you a unique insight into the correct placement of Artefacts within the Warehouse, to ensure the energies of the Artifacts do not react badly with each other."
14,,100CP,Magic Style: Arc of Embodiment ,Fairy Tail,Domain: Skills: Magic,"It's time to choose the Magical Styles that you have already learned upon entering this world. Whilst most magical styles can be learned with time and effort and the right teacher or source of knowledge, buying them here will allow them to benefit from the skill that Magic Skill ranks grant as well as allow access to extremely rare or lost magics or magics that require certain traits to use. A list of the magics that can be bought as well as their costs can be found at the end of the jump document. It should be noted that some Magic Styles will not be purchaseable through this option. Most of these are Holder Type magics, which all deal with magical items that are offered for purchase in the item section, and some are simply Caster Type magics that are too unique and either offered as part of a separate perk or not at all. This may change in the future as the series progresses or not."
15,,100CP,Magic Affinity ,Pokegirls,Domain: Skills: Magic,You have the ability to channel mana and learn magic which many mistake for a blood gift. Truthfully this ability has existed in humanity long before Sukebe’s experiments but was kept hidden by its users. Some even say Sukebe studied magic long before he first traveled to another dimension.
16,,100CP,Old Patient Magic ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You have learned how to cast charms, wards, and protections over places that grow more and more powerful, stable, and harder to damage with age. A door you reinforced with magic a year ago will be tougher than one you reinforced a day ago, and a scrying mirror you made decades ago will be able to see further than one you made a couple years back. The growth rate may not be much, and it grows slower over time, but it does add up over decades and centuries."
17,,100CP,Elemental Affinity ,Monster Girl Quest,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Your magical power seems in tune with a specific element. You now can develop your control over a certain element and take on properties similar to the element such as those with Fire Affinity leaving vicious burns, likewise, those with Wind Affinity could move at increased speeds, Water could give you mental clarity and Earth can give you strength and resistance to impacts. Such things however require practice and time with your element. You also know how to use this power when applied in sexual techniques like a Fire Affinity making your body perfectly warm to melt your opponent in pleasure, Wind Affinity letting you swing your hips faster, Earth Affinity could give your genitals a pleasantly rough sensation and increase the power of binded attacks, Water Affinity can see you have your insides swirl and perform wavy motion or make your body colder, Light Affinity could give you surreal softness and comfort, and finally Dark Affinity could give you devilish tightening and sucking. Your ability to use your affinity starts off at half that of Luka with a spirit if you do not have prior experience. This also advances your learning rate and strength for spells of your elemental affinity. If you already had a prior affinity for an element from another jump this perk gives you the knowledge to use it in sexual techniques from this world for free but no other benefits, in which case purchasing it grants the full benefits and strengthens that affinity. This can be taken multiple times."
18,,100CP,Energy is Energy ,Winger’s World,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Mana, Chi, Ki, Winger... Energy is energy. You can use Winger Energy to power any spell, technique or such that needs it."
19,,100CP,An Arcane Gift ,A Change In Tactics,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Of the many gods that exist in this world the majority were once dragons, from Naga and Grima to Duma and Mila and many others besides. Small wonder, when even infant dragons all but radiate arcane power. Your heritage has granted you a natural gift for magic, enough that you could wield simple spells without the use of tomes or staves simply by willing the power in your blood to action, though you still benefit from such aides if one is available. This talent also translates easily into skill should you put effort into training yourself, and you’ll find that you readily master many different kinds of sorcerous power, including those you acquire in worlds besides this one. "
20,,100CP,Faithful Servant ,Fate/Horse Order,Domain: Skills: Magic,"I do recall saying that you may or may not be a servant - well, with this, you probably are. You now possess a number of benefits that your status entitles you to, such as the ability to establish a contract with another person. This allows you to use their magical energy as your own and the ability to turn intangible - useful for many reasons, only some of which are perverted. However, this also gives them three command seals to use on you, orders you cannot deny. ...I said you had the basics of being a servant, not that you were worth turning into one. Any powers and abilities you may have been expecting are not here, and are something you will have to earn on your own merit. As of right now, even Mata Hari would be better in a fight than you. "
21,,100CP,Hero of Archanaea ,A Change In Tactics,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Though they come from many different backgrounds the Shepherds are all battle-hardened heroes and heroines. Not one among them is a stranger to the battlefield, and nearly all of them will become known as the world’s finest warriors one day. You have a high level of skill with one magic style of your choice, equivalent to several years of training and live combat experience. What’s more, your skill with your chosen fighting style grows at the uncommonly fast rate of a gifted prodigy, enough so that you could easily become the equivalent of a master swordsman within a few years with this perk alone. "
22,,100CP,Hero of the Staff ,Lewd Magic Isekai,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You weren’t even born in this world but the moment you laid hands on a magician’s staff you felt the gift of magic ignite in your blood, as if you were born to be a wizard. You have a natural talent for using any sort of magical power you might encounter, both here and in all future jumps to come. Whether it’s the kind of magic you learn from a book or the kind you can only be born with you’ll always have a natural affinity for learning how to use it and be able to attain a respectable degree of power and skill with it. You’ll still have to go about learning how to use that magic on your own time, but you’ll never meet a magic system that you totally suck at or simply can’t use at all. "
23,,100CP,Lewd Magician ,Lewd Magic Isekai,Domain: Skills: Magic,"“To be a magus is to walk with death”, said... some mage, at some point, who was taking themselves way too seriously. Magic is great for saving the world and stuff but it’s even more fun to have when you use it for sexy things! You’re a depraved genius at finding lewd uses for magic that was (probably) never meant to be used that way, even helping you invent new spells or modify existing ones to make them
safe to use in the bedroom. Any spells that you use or redesign in this way become prone to misfiring only in amusing and harmless ways if you happen to screw up casting them as opposed to whatever messy accidents you would usually have to deal with when misusing arcane power."
24,,200CP,Anima | Force of Personality ,Ravenwood,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Anima (200CP) The power of your own soul. Wisps of spiritual energy bound to yourself, able to be shaped into quasi-physical garb or used to reinforce that which you already possess. Each shaped bit or aspect of yourself acts as a receptacle for the wisps you possess, and filling them increases the strength provided, but limits the amount you can put elsewhere. However, it only takes a few moments, vital in any battle, to shift these wisps around and change the boons they provide.
Force of Personality (0CP) Your core personality is reinforced and you gain an awareness of any influence on your mind beyond completely natural methods, making it difficult for anything to change you from who you are. This also provides an awareness that gives you insights into others and gives a bit of extra personal charisma"
25,,200CP,Common Magic ,Nexus 2.0,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Light is something everyone has, regardless if they are a fighter or not. As such, even the most common laborer will use it to their advantage. You find your abilities are easier to use when turned towards a profession that doesn't involve fighting. Crafting, farming, construction, cooking, and any other profession is able to benefit from your various abilities with great ease."
26,,200CP,Conceptual Fertilization ,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The secret art of Conceptual Fertilization is one that may seem a bit strange and even unnatural to those not as invested as you in the mystic arts but...well, they don't complain so much when you show them the results. Conceptual Fertilization refers to a very rare magical ability that allows one to combine two things during the creation process of one of those things, transferring the qualities of the second thing onto the first. Combining the blood of a dragon with a infant in the womb to grant them the magical power of that dragon as they grow up, for instance. With time and further mastery, it may even be possible to combine more than one thing in this way, though one cannot begin to think of the sacrifices the failed attempts might cause. Additionally, you find that you are also able to perform this process on other things in their creation process, not just living beings, allowing you to infuse weapons or other objects in the process of being created with the traits of other things."
27,,200CP,An Excellent Source Of Mana ,Fate/Horse Order,Domain: Skills: Magic,"How horrid of you. Instead of making friends with the animals, it seems you’re more skilled at taking them apart or utilizing resources drawn with them. Magical spells using foci or potions using ingredients created from the flesh of beasts are more powerful in your hands. You could use it to get away with using substandard parts for just as much oomph, or you could entice a Phantasmal Beast to fuck you in order to get a truly useful ingredient, their cum. And their everything else if I’m being honest, but I doubt you can kill it so easily. Lastly, you do actually know a handful of magicals spells that use these ingredients - mostly bedroom things and alterations to your appearance, but there’s a poison or two in here as well. "
28,,200CP,Aroused Accessibility ,Winger’s World,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Your spells and devices work better when you are aroused. Magic comes to you easier and the words flow with less error. Technology does what its supposed to without bugs or malfunctions and spells will be more powerful. Course, you’ll have to deal with the increasing arousal eventually. "
29,,200CP,...Beware the Abyss Staring Back. ,Evening Starter,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Delving further into the depths of occult knowledge, this allows you to do two things. First, it allows you the ability to work with ritual-styled magic, which can affect entire areas (normally the size of a large building). Secondly, this allows you to digitize all magic tomes and grimoires in a manner that allows for their usage in rituals or with sorcery emulators. "
30,,200CP,Blood is Magic... ,Evening Starter,Domain: Skills: Magic,"This quaint ability is something all Witches are able to do. The ability to regain magical power through the bodily fluids of others. Without a Magical Back-Up Battery, this is a rather inefficient process, but it is still viable. While you could gain quite a bit of magic from the blood of others, it is considered quite a taboo. Normally, the blood would need to be fresh and become worthless if allowed into blood packs or unenchanted storage mediums. You, however, can gather magic from blood just perfectly without those drawbacks. Still, if blood is too much for you and you’re into that sort of thing, the easiest and most benign way to regain magical power is through semen, the fresher the better. "
31,,200CP,Body Modification ,eratohoK,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You have delved into the forbidden magical arts of modifying someone’s body. You can easily cause people to grow a penis (or vagina and breasts) temporarily or permanently, cause someone to begin or stop lactating, change their hair colour and hair length, and modify someone’s height and weight (within normal limits of their race). It can even be done on someone who doesn’t consent – do be careful with this. "
32,,200CP,Classic Magic ,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Not everything can be about sex, sadly. Pick one of the four basic elements, wind, water, earth, or fire. You are now an accomplished user of that particular style of magic. In addition to that, you’ve also got a smaller array of other things, such as divination, potion making, curses, all those sorts of things which can actually be used for sex. "
33,,200CP,“Dual Cultivation” ,Lewd Magic Isekai,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Kids these days have it easy when it comes to learning magic. Even the Hero had to work his butt off for his talents to reach their full maturity but his elf sidekick went from having zero magical talent to being a respectable mage and all she had to do was become his fuck buddy. Like the hero’s elf apprentice you’re able to soak up magical power and expand your arcane talents at a vastly accelerated rate just by having sex with people who are stronger or more experienced than you. You’re able to gain both knowledge and power from your “mentors” this way, with new spells and techniques in their arsenals manifesting in your mind in the form of sudden flashes of insight, though you’ll still need extensive practice to master these spells to the same degree as those you learned them from."
34,,200CP,Lay on Hands ,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You have a moderate amount of training from a religious institute. Whether this makes you a pope knockoff, a sexy nun, or something more eastern is up to you, though you probably aren’t more than a local priest to a nearby town. That said, you can probably exorcise weak monsters, identify others, and use a small amount of magic. "
35,,200CP,Magic Penis ,Generic Hentai Modern,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Moving in the other direction, you can temporarily ‘steal’ body parts, either through copying or through outright theft. Want to have a horsecock for tonight? Find one, and give it a quick pat on the head. Or, be kinky and steal popular dude #39’s and replace it with his girlfriend's vagina. Just for kicks. "
36,,200CP,Magic Tricks ,A Change In Tactics,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Any mage worth his salt can cast battle magic: whether of fire, wind, thunder, darkness or light, all are simple expressions of raw magical power, devoid of finesse or subtlety. There is far more to the powers of faith and reason than mere elemental destruction, and you are a learned master of both these simple battle magics and more complex spellwork. Like any accomplished mage you have the talent and finesse necessary to use all manner of spells and incantations that can accomplish various utility tasks without the use of a tome or staff, such as tracking the location of a marked target, warding against unwanted pregnancies, or conjuring a gust of wind to blow away a bad smell. You may choose to be a master of either sacred or arcane magic, wielding spells of healing and defense and sacred power with one and all manner of elemental might with the other. This perk may also be purchased twice to gain both types of magic, though Mages only receive a discount on the first purchase. 
*this perk counts as being purchased twice "
37,,200CP,Mana Conversion ,Fate/Whore Order,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Normally, Tantric rituals are complicated. You have to do this, they have to do that, and you have to do it at the same time. Obviously your failures are enjoyable, but getting something useful out of it is practically a chore. Luckily, you can now skip all of that nonsense and just directly use the sperm pumped into you as magical energy. This is arguably even better twice over for not costing any of their own energy. I’m sure there’s a lucky guy out there who would be more than happy to get another bond level with you... and dozens of men who would like to fire and forget, and would give you way more energy through sheer force of numbers. Oh, and it doesn’t actually matter where you take it, once it’s inside of you the energy is yours. "
38,,200CP,Master of Rituals ,Bible Black,Domain: Skills: Magic,"In this world, Rituals are the path to great power or works. Spending hours chanting and preparing a sacrifice for the ritual culminating in a result that will either greatly empower the occultists involved or screw them royally (if the summoned demon isn’t cooperative). With this, all of your basic rituals will succeed with little effort. Grand Rituals will have an even greater chance of success than normal. On top of this, any ritualistic offerings will always appease the spirit, demon, or devil you are invoking. You are even able to get away with a lesser offering for most of your rituals, with a necessary life offering being replaced with an offering of blood or virginity if the need arises. Summoning the Devil or a Greater spirit will always require a life offering/sacrifice though. All rituals will take less time than they would have before, with day-long rituals being satisfied in hours or hour-long rituals in minutes. "
39,,200CP,Potion Master ,Lewd Magic Isekai,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Not every master magician is also a master alchemist but you’ve got a gift for the chemistry side of things that’s just as potent as your talent for spellslinging. From health and mana potions to sleeping draughts and poisons you have the skill to whip up all kinds of concoctions both helpful and harmful as long as you have the right tools and ingredients available for them. What’s more, you can also add lewd side-effects to otherwise ordinary potions with no extra time or resources required. For instance you could create a mana potion that also increases the drinker’s breast size or makes her lactate, or create a sleeping potion that also increases the body’s sensitivity. Of course you can also simply make ordinary potions with lewd effects, such as aphrodisiac poisons, and these are especially potent when created in an undiluted form. "
40,,200CP,Power Perversion Potential ,Generic Hentai World,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Of course you learned magic so you could use it for sex, who in their right mind wouldn’t? You can easily repurpose existing spells or techniques for lewd purposes and invent new powers with a fraction of the time and effort it would take another person to do the same as long as those powers are intended primarily for sexual purposes. "
41,,200CP,Scholar of Darkness ,A Change In Tactics,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Though it is often associated with vile powers dark magic is merely a tool like any other form of magic. Darkness is primordial energy and to call on its power is to grasp magic limited only by the caster’s own abilities. You have learned to harness this power for yourself, and your ability to customize and design spells and hexes is greatly enhanced. Using dark magic with any sort of magic system makes the end result much more flexible in possible effects than that system would normally allow, leaving the caster’s own abilities as the primary limiting factor. However breaking those limits or miscasting dark magic spells will inflict backlash on the caster. Your spells will tend to do so in ways that are perverse and inconvenient rather than life-threatening, but don’t push your luck unless you enjoy side-effects like nymphomania or comically-large breast enhancements which can’t be easily undone."
42,,200CP,Sexual Healing ,Generic Hentai World,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You have learned a technique to generate energy through sex with one or more partners and can use this power to heal or recharge both your own and your partner’s health and energy reserves. The more sex you have the more power you’ll get out of it; a quickie or a blowjob will only give you back a small amount of energy, but an hour-long power fuck can top off the reserves of even the most powerful of jumpers. "
43,,200CP,Sorcery and Supremacy ,World of Tentacles,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Lesser tentacle monsters might feed on their sexual conquests just to gain their next meal but a demon king has much grander ambitions than merely surviving another day. You may substitute sexual activity for magical training, allowing you to grow stronger through your sexual conquests rather than traditional study and practice. In addition to growing in power over time you can also develop specific skill sets at a faster pace through your fetishes and choices of partners: indulging in a BDSM fetish will accelerate the growth of your skill in binding and sealing magics for instance, while seducing a magical girl who primarily wields fire magic may lead to some of her talents rubbing off on you. You may apply the effects of this perk to any kind of spiritual or magical power you possess. "
44,,200CP,Summoning ,Rance 02,Domain: Skills: Magic,"There’s no need to dirty your own hands when you can just summon some help to take care of your enemies. The art of summoning magic is your speciality. Right now you can only bound phantom beasts that are marginally weaker than you, but with some practice and experience, you will become able to summon any kind of creature that is weaker than yourself. "
45,,200CP,External Influence ,E.V.O. Search for Eden,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Creepy. You can now use your EVO and any relevant perks to evolve creatures and beings other than yourself. The cost to do so is less than it would take for you to make the same changes, letting you change small handfuls of individuals at a time for the same cost. This ability only works on willing or helpless targets."
46,,200CP,Kiln | Raven | Raven – Tempered ,Ravenwood,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Kiln (200CP) You are what is known as a Kiln, capable of wielding Delfire. Often called scavenger's magic, Delfire is the combination of different forms of magic that has taken on new properties, becoming a small orb surrounded by an oddly colored flame-like aura. This is the source of delfire's name, and they do not emphasize fire over any other element. You are able to store these orbs of delfire within yourself, giving you resistance to disease, poison, curses, and corruption as it is eaten away by the delfire. Additionally, delfire acts as a spell matrix, capable of producing unusual effects when fueled by any type of energy. If you possess the Natural Magic perk, you may create orbs of Delfire by mixing various energies together. Post jump, you will be able to come across new orbs of Delfire naturally if you wish, however it is up to you whether the delfire spawns in the setting.
Raven (0CP) Every villager that leaves the bounds of Ravenwood is accompanied by a raven. These ravens are fairly weak, but incredibly intelligent for animals and are able to act as scouts. You can double the number of ravens you possess by paying 50cp, this may be done multiple times (to a maximum of 16 ravens for 200cp, or 250cp for Denizens). A killed raven returns the next dawn. If you purchase a pet or similar creature in another jump, you may instead import your ravens, all of them, to gain any special traits the pet would offer. If you have the option to import a pet in some way, you may import all of your ravens with a single purchase, all of them gaining the same benefit. Additionally, you may purchase the following modifiers that may be added to your ravens; you may to decide how many of your ravens possess the modifier, including all of them. All such modifiers are discounted to Locals, if this would bring the price under 50cp or the modifier is already discounted, it is free
Raven – Tempered (0CP) Your raven(s) are instead tempered ravens, with a slightly metallic appearance to their feathers, claws, and beak. These ravens possess incredible stamina and recover it quite quickly, which they can use to power delfire or to create a flame-like effect along their feathers that increases their speed, durability, and sharpness of their claws and beak at the cost of tiring themselves quickly. Finally, they are able to hold a single orb of delfire within their body to use, with all that entails"
47,,200CP,Magic Repository ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Fun fact: mice are excellent catalysts for magic rituals since they naturally accumulate and store magic within their bodies. Like mice, you can find it easy to store magic and other energies in your body, essentially increasing your overall storage capacity. It also becomes easier for you to naturally absorb magic and energy from your surroundings. And unlike mice, you aren't locked out from actually using/releasing the magic you build up inside you, so don't worry about that."
48,,200CP,Runic Spell Innovator ,World Seed,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Considering that one simply needs to combine the runes for Blast and Fire to make a fireball, or use the do the same with the Reinforce and Mind runes to create a basic spell to protect against mind altering effects, one might think that runic magic is incredibly easy. Well, one would be wrong. Runes can be considered a programming language of sorts, affecting reality. They are used to program magical devices, and also for Runic Magic, an alternative to Arcane Magic that uses less mana and requires less control over your mana, but only does exactly what you program it to do. Now, as with regular programming, any schmuck can do the equivalent of writing hello world and throw a fireball or two, but anything more complex than that requires intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, and patience. Things that you now possess in spades. And with that and the knowledge of the runic language, infinite possibilities lie open to you: whether it's bashing someone's head in with the Force rune, setting up intricate spell diagrams and runic circles to automate even the most complex of processes, or creating spells of all magical disciplines for anything you can think of and more, someone who truly knows how to use Runic Magic is a sight to behold. And your true talent, the invention and creation of new runic spells and programs, applies to all of these avenues. If you keep at it, no magic will be beyond your reach."
49,,200CP,The Dark Crystal , Azeroth,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Draenei use crystals that are, possibly, native to their homeworld for almost all aspects of their daily lives. Even their technology, magic, and homes are made of these crystals. Certain Artificers are capable of 'Programming' these crystals to do certain things ranging from protecting an entire city in a shield or powering magitek spaceships that can travel the void of space. You now have their knowledge of these ancient arts and are capable of incorporating this magitek into your own technology or magic."
50,,200CP,That's My Fetich! ,Generic Hentai World,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Why do magical rituals the boring way when you can do them the fun way instead? This perk allows you to substitute lewdness for exotic ingredients, rituals, and so on, either for magic or other powers that allow for this sort of thing. For example rather than ritual chanting you could perform a ritual orgy, or use a virgin’s cum as a substitute for a virgin’s blood. The rarity of the ingredients must be relatively similar however: if all you need is magical energy then some tantric sex is fine for providing it, but if you need something like a god-forged diamond from the heart of a star then expect to go questing for something like the crystalized girl-cum of a virgin succubus or something equivalently-rare."
51,,300CP,Rainbow Notes ,Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch,Domain: Skills: Magic,"While mermaids are superior singers, humans invented the art of song to begin with.  You are now gifted in the art of music composition, and can creatively piece together the notes and lyrics for new songs effortlessly.  In fact, your songs are good enough such that, when sung or played by a magical being such as a mermaid, or someone with magical music like a fantasy bard, they have magical powers of their own.  And the greatest thing about music is that it is a treasure that can be shared with anyone.  You can teach your songs, even magical ones, to companions and other pupils willing to learn.  Please also note that the perk also applies to other musical forms outside of singing, such as the piano, as well as other things such as dancing, prayers, and spell chants."
52,,300CP,Arcane Power ,World of Tentacles,Domain: Skills: Magic,"A monster isn’t necessarily strong only in body and monster hunters often have far more exotic tools at their disposal than guns and swords. This perk gives you a measure of power in some form of mystic art common to your chosen setting, such as magic. The specific rules of this system will be down to your setting to determine but it must require the expenditure of a limited power supply such as mana, chakra, ki, spirit energy, or some other source of arcane energy. As with Inhuman we’ll use a tier system to describe your capabilities with this magic system but these tiers only describe the starting point of your power, you are fully capable of developing your skill and power with the abilities provided by this perk. 
For 100 CP you can be a Tier 1 mystic. This tier describes beings with very limited magical power such as newly-awakened magical girls or very weak monsters. Beings with this tier can choose for their magic to be weak but flexible, such as an apprentice wizard who has mastered 4-5 cantrips, or stronger but more specialized, such as a magical girl who can only cast fire magic but can do so strongly enough to fight a 
Tier 2 monster. This tier is at the lower end of what might be considered “street level”. Characters of the Demon King origin receive this tier for free and deduct its cost from the cost of the higher tiers. For 200 CP you can be a Tier 2 
mystic. This tier describes experienced mages and powerful monsters at the upper end of street level. A Tier 2 mage can defend himself against most conventional threats such as men with guns and often has an array of powers at the level of a Tier 1 specialist. A Tier 2 specialist might be a psychic with telekinesis strong enough to knock a small building off its foundations or a magical girl who can pose a serious threat to a full-fledged demon king. 
For 300 CP you can be a Tier 3 mystic, which is the realm of the aforementioned demon kings as well as powerful wizards with years of training and experience. A generalist of this level may have over a dozen separate powers ranging from shields to illusions to fireballs to teleportation, all of it at the level of a Tier 2 specialist, and Tier 3 specialists may be as powerful as a Tier 3 monster, able to pose a significant threat to entire military forces and deal damage to whole city blocks at a time with their magic. "
53,,300CP,Witch ,Taimanin,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Whether through a demonic pact, specialized training, binding a demon within you, or even simply being half-demon, you have gained the ability to manipulate magic. The magical abilities possessed by witches and sorcerers vary but includes things such as divination, crafting magical items or potions, summoning magical armor, casting curses, creating magical creatures, and many other things though most human practitioners only manage to master a handful of abilities. Does not need to be demonic aspected."
54,,300CP,Alchemy ,Queens Blade,Domain: Skills: Magic,You are extremely adept at this world’s alchemy and are a fairly good inventor to boot. This abilitycomes with a clockwork automaton and a controller to control it. It can easily take most warriors in a fight.

Harnesses a magical language to produce a wide variety of effects. Fairly unique in that it can be learned by anyone, even if they've already chosen their discipline. As such, this magic can be purchased regardless of how many others you've bought already, even without Multidisciplinary Magic.
Sorrows: Your talent is equal to that of China Sorrows, the world's most well-known user of this discipline. With this, you have become capable of producing greater effects than before. From producing waves of energy to masquerading as another, you can do it all. You can even carve sigils into your very body without a single worry of a mistake. Using this power, you could even seal others' True Names, provided they meet the requirements for doing so, of course. What you can do now is virtually limitless, as long as you know the right runes. And if the runes you want don't exist, you can always just invent your own.

56,,350CP,Profession: Inscription ,Azeroth,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Enchanting, Inscription, Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Engineering, Leatherworking, Tailoring, and Jewelcrafting. Your first purchase is half off and starts you off at an apprentice level. For an additional 50 CP you start off at a Journeyman level with all blueprints of that level and lower. For another 50 CP you will jump up to Expert with all blueprints of that level and lower. For a final purchase of 50 CP you will be an Artisan (the highest level in the game before this system was removed) with all blueprints for your profession(s) that exist within the game."
57,,400CP,All Magic Affinity ,In Another World With My Smartphone,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Like what it implies, you have an Affinity with all types of magic, including all types of Null magic. This means that you have the (possibly unique) ability to use all types of magic in the world, needing only to know the chant needed to activate it and a general idea of what the magic is supposed to do. For example by knowing that the Gate spell requires the chant of gate and that it is a spell that opens a portal to a place you have already been you would be capable of casting that spell. You carry this ability to quickly learn and master all forms of magic to future worlds and systems.
Leaving that aside your magic is tremendously potent and you have a monstrous amount of magical energy, enough that you could chain cast extremely powerful spells affecting incredible numbers of people without even noticing fatigue, much less actually suffering from such. In fact unless and until someone tells you that magical fatigue is supposed to be a thing after casting a lot of magic you probably won't even realize there's supposed to be a limit on how much magic a person can use."
58,,400CP,Ambient Magic: Stone ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Stone: The most common form of Earth Magic, this magic allows stonesensing, the ability to communicate with and move stone (with permission), communication with and limited protection from volcano spirits, bringing light and heat to stones or crystals, identification of stone as well as nonstone materials similar to stone (Pearl, Coral, etc), increasing the malleability of stone, and even (in extremis) self petrification. It is practiced by Evvy and Jebilu Stoneslicer. Working in stone is difficult, and their ability to shape stones isn't as fine as other craft mages, but the tradeoff is that they tend to last much longer than those of others. Since stones have long memories, scrying the past is relatively easy for stonemages."
59,,400CP,Ambient Magic: Carpentry ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Skills: Magic,"A form of Earth Magic, it allows the magical shaping of wood, the identification of wood, the strengthening of processed wood, the softening of processed wood, and the sensing of weaknesses within wooden objects. It is practiced by Niamara Bancanor, Camoc Oakborn, and Arnen."
60,,400CP,Ambient Magic: Cooking ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Skills: Magic,"A form of Fire Magic, Chef Magic draws power from all aspects of cooking and the manipulation of fire. A Chef Mage's senses of taste and smell are incredibly precise, able to accurately judge both contents and quantities of ingredients. A Chef mage can, in defiance of that age old adage, pull some or all of an ingredient out of a dish with enough concentration. They can enhance flavors, healthiness, or even how much sustenance someone gains. They are also extremely skilled with knives. It is practiced by Jorality Bancanor, Olennika Potcracker, and Gorse."
61,,400CP,Ambient Magic: Glass ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Skills: Magic,"A form of Fire Magic, in which the user creates unique glass objects with magical abilities (eg. scrying orbs or tracker / warning pellets), as well as identification of glass works without sight through the piece's own knowledge of its form. It is practiced by Kethlun Warder. Glassmages can make lenses and mirrors that grant extrasensory abilities, such as the ability to see magic or track footprints. They can also make warded or incredibly strong windows."
62,,400CP,Ambient Magic: Painting ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Although nothing is known of them, it is known that there are Ambient Mages with power over Painting, Pottery, Horses, and Birds. Rumors say there is also an Ambient Magic of Hunting, but that may be little more than legend."

64,,400CP,Ambient Magic: Smith ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Skills: Magic,"A form of Fire Magic, it allows the sensing and manipulation of metals, ores, and other materials used in Smithing (like coal), resistance to fire and burning metal, resistance to smoke damage to lungs, and varying levels of fire manipulation. It is practiced by Daja and Dedicate Frostpine. Not only are Smithmages immune to normal fire and being pierced by nonmagical metal, they can craft supernaturally sharp blades, future scrying mirrors, and any number of charms from engraved metal or twisted wire."
65,,400CP,Aura Surgeon ,World Seed,Domain: Skills: Magic,"One thing that all beings and objects in Neolife possess, and soon those in the real world as well, considering that exposure to mana leads to its manifestation, is an Aura. You could consider it a magical blueprint of how something works. And it truly shows everything: skills, abilities, physical makeup, personality, memory, and much more. Animals and plants have flowing auras, full of twists and turns, whereas processed items like machines have jagged auras, full of hard lines like a 3D circuit diagram. One peculiarity of Aura is that any of its changes are reflected in the being or object possessing the Aura. Xeno-shifters, an advanced Druid class, make use of that to mimic the aura of lifeforms they have studied in order to gain both their forms and abilities, for example.
It is also how Technomancers are able to replicate the effects of implants within themselves, by simply copying their Auras into their bodies. But for all of its potential advantages, tampering with your own Aura can also go incredibly wrong if you mess it up, especially when it involves your brain, such as causing brain damage, death of personality, or just the normal kind of death. It's good, then, that with your skill at manipulating and changing Auras, yours and those of others, mistakes like that won't ever happen. It wouldn't be wrong to call you an Aura Artisan.
So long as you have an example to study, you'll be able to safely and successfully apply any of its abilities or peculiarities either to yourself or somebody else, and even combine parts of the Auras of many beings to create truly powerful forms. After studying a massive amount of different Auras to get a feel for how they work, you'll even be able to go so far as to create original Auras and beings, or change parts of your Aura to give yourself entirely new abilities."
66,,400CP,Create Zombie ,JoJo,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You can infuse a corpse with a small ounce of your blood, twisting them into a vampiric minion of yours called a Zombie. They have the Blood Vessel Needle ability, and any other abilities they used in life. A Zombie can be made from any sort of corpse, so long as the circulatory system is intact. Zombies retain all qualities they had in life, including intellect."
67,,400CP,Developing Power Lines ,Ah My Goddess,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Earth Lines are the very core of a Earth Spirits power; also known as Dragon Streams, Earth Power Veins, Leylines, and Life Streams. These are the natural flows of the world’s core energy, called Earth energy but it's nearly indistinguishable with magical and spiritual energy, the very source of a Earth Spirits power and the connection they have with the world. Whilst it is true that most Earth Lines are immobile and new ones don't appear, without the intervention of a powerful Earth Spirit, God, or Demon you thankfully are a strong enough spirit to do so. You're roughly equal to a God(dess) of the Second Class in raw power and able to move existing lines around to be more in tune with urbane developments or even produce new lines, though such an act would be hugely draining upon the you, on the level of spiritually and magically draining yourself completely in one go to be exact. These Earth Lines can be tapped into by Earth Spirits like yourself, or maybe if your nice and grant permission a few others could gain some benefits of these mystic lines of power, but only an Earth Spirit could use the power found in the Earth Lines to its full potential and non Earth Spirits will find the power on par with a diminished Third Class Earth Spirit."
68,,400CP,Forged Of Gods ,Dungeon Keeper Ami,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The powers of the light have their own strengths of course, among those is the ability to create hero gates through which no evil may pass, you also can now create these portals, with enough preparation it is possible to create hero gates strong enough to pass a small army through. This also grants you the knowledge of how to craft weapons and items out of adamantine, a metal that is made of the remains of a dead god, and even allows you to forge otherwise unbreakable metals as if they were steel."
69,,400CP,From Trinitite to Powerstones ,GURPS Technomancer,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The world of Technomancer does not stand still, and science marches forever onward, even when mana gets involved. And perhaps one of the best ways to march onward is to steal liberally from natural phenomena. You can, by examining a natural magical effect for a few days, figure out how to replicate that phenomena with a spell."
70,,400CP,Ability over Strength ,Evening Starter,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You're not the strongest or the toughest of fighters, but you’ve got a certain flare. Your melee attacks rely upon speed and technique, which you have in spades. However, your real ability comes from your supernatural capability. Any abilities you have that are supernatural in nature (magic, ki, etc) gain greater potency, allowing you to use stronger abilities with less cost. "
71,,400CP,Mind Your Own ,Rance 02,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Not all magic is about blasting concentrated mana into enemies or burn down towns with fire. No, there is an aspect of magic that is more...subtle and elegant. Perfect for those who are against direct confrontation. You chose to further your studies in the art of mind magic, a group of spells that deal with hypnotism, making illusions and generally messing with the brain of your opponents. It will work perfectly on most, just by applying your magic while maintaining eye contact for a second. However, those who are vastly more powerful than you or have great willpower will prove themselves resistant to you, even if not immune. "
72,,400CP,Ageless Talent ,World of Lewd Elves,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Much of a younger elf’s life is spent meticulously mastering a skill, focusing every day for years on improving their performance with an intensity that would baffle most humans. But such diligence pays off well as many elves are considered to be the undisputed masters in whatever field they study in. Choose a skill that you have studied and practiced for most of your lifetime to the point of mastery. An elven alchemist would have a vast knowledge of potions and medicines with a countless variety of effects. An elven archer could hit perfect bullseye at ranges that a normal human would balk at, while an elf swordmaster could fight many foes at once with a grace and lethality that would baffle the average fighter.

74,,400CP,Bitch Witch ,Hypno App Fantasia,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Aren’t you meant to be a shining heroine of might and magic? It hardly seems appropriate to have a class like this. You’ve totally maxed out to 99 the Lewd Witch class, learning all sorts of terribly inappropriate magics. It’s terrible for actual fighting and stats but you’ll have spells for everything from endless orgasms and erasing refractory periods, to changing the size of all the important bits, summoning wriggling slimy tentacles, controlling the minds of others and more! Since it is magic, you’ll only be able to work it on those that can’t resist or overpower you but it gives so much more creativity than just a single relic. Best of all, you’re able to cast any magic you know through lewd actions, replacing any need for speaking or gestures or tools with the fun stuff. Slurp and lick your allies to healthy, empowered states!"
75,,400CP,"Curses and ""Curses"" ",Fate/Horse Order,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Despite the seemingly obvious outcome of a servant fucking a horse, addiction to the horse, abandonment of former lovers, and a bouncing baby ready to fuck more servants, the last of such things is impossible. The body of a servant simply isn't set up to do such a thing. Or more poetically, the dead are not suitable to create new life. Not that anybody worth mentioning cares about or even follows such a rule. And now, neither do you. You've learned a number of magical spells - or 'curses' if you prefer - that alter the body. Amping up lust, allowing for bigger insertion, the remodeling of a servants body to support childbirth... you know, the normal stuff. Mind you, that last one is a killer on your mana reserves. Or, if watching wasn't your thing, you could 'curse' yourself with a bigger dick (read as, hung like a horse) to try and win them back. "
76,,400CP,Magic Prodigy ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You have a gift with magic that comes all too rarely to generations. You can easily learn different schools of magic that have been created, and you are able to find innovative ways to effectively use even spells that are normally marginalized as useless.  Furthermore, you are now able to learn and use any of the magic spells existing in the MGE setting without needing spirit or demon energy for it to work.  You start out with a fair knowledge of and aptitude for all the myriad of magic school – archaeomancy (the orthodox magic system), hieromancy (holy/light/divine rituals traditionally used by clerics/heroes of the Chief God), necromancy (life/death magic), nymphomancy (succubus magic), pharmacomancy (healing) teletomancy (extra-big/strong spells), theriomancy (“beast” physical enhancement), etc. – and if you take the time I’m sure you’ll find more schools and develop your skills further, with the potential to eventually master the full depth of each art."
77,,400CP,Elemental General ,Queens Blade,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You like General Claudette possess a magical affinityto one element that you can effectively wield in combat. Thunder is already taken but you may also pick from fire, water, wind, or earth if you don’t want to copy that. May be taken multiple times. If a Vance you’re also now a general. Good for you. "
78,,400CP,Forbidden Knowledge ,Rance 02,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Well, isn’t this a surprise. You got a little bit of knowledge about magic, regardless of your aptitude for it. What kind of magic? The forbidden one. Curses, rituals with people or souls as payment, sacrificial rites, etc. Some of these are powerful spells, there’s even one to travel across time. Yet, all of these are plenty against most people’s morals and more often than not, with side effects that could prove nefarious and dangerous. What will you do with this?"
79,,400CP,Grand Meister ,Bible Black,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Your skill in magic and knowledge of the occult is on the level of the greatest of names. Merlin, Aleister Crowley, you are on the same level as they are when it comes to your ability. Spells cast take less effort both magically and physically. Rituals are super-charged when you lead them. Sacrifices and Offerings mean more spiritually and magically than they did before. But that isn’t all. You aren’t just a magical powerhouse, but a leader of occultists as well. Those who study magic will look up to you and follow your advice more than before. You are their mentor, their leader, maybe even a figure of worship. "
80,,400CP,I Love It Like This ,Generic Hentai Magical Girl,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The way the Sins generate power is odd. Instead of simply generating it and refilling their reserves, they gain power from indulging in their sin. Mostly that's lust and thus having sex. It could be gluttony and doing things in excess, or greed by taking what others have. Coincidentally, both of those can also refer to sex, though it doesn't have to. Anyways, unlike the Shoujo, they don't stop once they reach a certain point. As long as they continue to indulge, they keep generating power. "

Well, turns out it can also improve magical power (increasing reserves and potency) — with the proper rituals. Well, you know those rituals now and you’re able to improve your magical prowess. And that Taboo about fresh blood? Well, let’s just say no one will complain if you were to drain a few individuals here and there now. You’re a fairly powerful individual now, after all. Just don’t slaughter innocents in mass, though. Some things just simply can’t be ignored. "
82,,400CP,Magician of the Night,Kyonyuu Fantasy,Domain: Skills: Magic,"While magic is not unknown to the world, people who have a talent for it are few and far between. It seems though that, like Nelis or Cuvier, you are one of the few people around who could claim to be an expert in such affairs. Your magical arsenal includes summoning malicious spirits and krakens to attack your enemies, creating regenerating golems and warded rooms that can keep out even Succubi, casting divination spells to predict the future, and even miniaturizing an army of soldiers and hiding them in wine barrels. You also are quite skilled in the erotic magic Emerialia used to enslave people with her body, so try to be responsible with that please. Should you also have chosen to be skilled in magical lore through the Noble Pursuits perk you may even be a match for Prime Minister Historias, the most powerful magician on the continent. "
83,,400CP,Magical Master ,Monster Girl Quest,Domain: Skills: Magic,Magic is a powerful force. You have an astounding ability to cast spells and your magical power is nothing to scoff at either. Capable of powerful spells such as fire hotter than thermite and bolts of frost that can flash freeze enemies less durable than bronze. You also have a collection of lewd spells and can create minor wonders such as shrinking spells or perhaps a stylish living hat that is safe to wear but can act as an onahole that drains victims of their energy; these minor wonders usually need to be in the style of a witch or magical girl. Lastly your pool of accessible magical energy is much higher. 
84,,400CP,Magical Modifications ,Fate/Loli Order,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Let’s be honest, you’re anything but normal. Chaldea doesn’t even hire normal, it only wants the best of the best of the best to assist in their mission of preserving human history. If you didn’t meet that level of skill, they would never have hired you. As it turns out, your talent is for modifying things. Jury rigging equipment, a spell to be fire instead of ice, a curse to inflict pleasure instead of pain. Creating something from scratch isn’t for you, but altering an already existing invention? Well within your grasp. Why, you might even be able to take a hypnosis app and make it even more powerful.

You've picked up a solid but eccentric magical education, covering a wide base of practical spells that might save your life in the field along with a few ""just for fun"" spells, like a curse of shared pleasure and some other lewd bedroom tricks. But more important than merely knowing these spells, you've got enough practice with them to cast spells quickly and reliably even under pressure, like combat conditions. You won't be fighting any kind of servant-level enemies with just this perk but you won't be helpless to defend yourself if an angry Engineer or a troop of celtic soldiers catch you without your servants nearby. "

You’ve got some of that old-fashioned magic in you and you’re able to use many kinds of sexual magic based on whatever your theme might be. Choose a single fetish such as BDSM or mind control as your theme: any form of magical powers related to your fetish becomes much stronger and easier to use for you, and you gain an assortment of magical powers based on your fetish. For instance if you were a bondage youma you might be able to conjure all kinds of magical restraints, controlling them freely and restraining a victim’s magic or other abilities along with their bodies. At minimum these spells are a match for the basic elemental spells that the Senshi use but the more narrowly you define your fetish the stronger your related magic becomes."
87,,400CP,Orgasmic Extraction ,World of Tentacles,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You have mastered using elaborate setups to extract 'orgasmic energy' from one or more donors, which can then be substituted (in sufficient quantities) for other types of energy, be it mana, 'life energy’ or simply massive amounts of electric power. The precise setup, from ritual circles calling tentacles through portals to mechanical rape machines, must be tailored to the specific application it is fueling. It may take hours to complete as it weakens the donor’s ability to resist further climaxes, but only does so when the last of the donors involved is overcome. The rarer, or larger, the amount of energy you require the more that will need to be taken from the donors, and there is a chance that there may not be enough for the intended purpose. However more attractive donors and more 'intense' setups provide more energy and any reserves of the desired energy that the donors possess can be tapped through the setup.

While you may not be much of a mage with this perk alone you're a veritable fountain of magical energy, to such a degree that it has a substantial impact not only on your potential as a magus but also on your sexual virility, endurance, and... well, endowments. You have a really nice cock is what I'm saying, and with a bit of practice you could satisfy even very demanding lovers like Medb and Ishtar, or several less demanding lovers like the Prisma Trio. And if that weren't enough, at the same time that you're rocking someone's world you're also refuelling their mana supplies to their full capacity. The Engineer might have you beat when he's in top form but can his cock power a noble phantasm like yours can? "

The knowledge to create magic seals is now yours to use. Because one really needs to get alternatives against beings that exceed so much the average of the world. These are very powerful seals, capable to straight up confining Dark Lords and possibly even a weakened Demon King. They also work quite effectively at sealing other kinds of beings, be devils, monsters or creatures from other worlds."

You now possess the ability to freely alter your body, within limit. With effort, you can affect others as well, though not as easily. In addition, said modifications need not follow the laws of physics, instead obeying porn logic. To top it off, you know a number of mind altering spells, ranging from 'suddenly very horny' to 'you were always a girl'. As you might imagine, the energy needed to cast these spells can only be obtained from sex. "

You can freely reshape parts of your body, turning hands into claws or swords, sprouting tentacles at will, and altering your appearance freely. Reshaping your body in this way requires you to invest some of your magical energy into it, subtracting from your available maximum until you return to your true form, and the more extensive the change the more energy is needed to maintain it. Apart from altering your appearance you can also hulk out into a powered up form, split yourself into multiple bodies, or even assume a single energy form like fire or lightning if you have magical power on par with a Dark General, allowing you to do things like turn your body into electricity and travel through the power system like Electricus if you had an enormous amount of energy to spare.

In transformed mode, you are much stronger and tougher than normal - you’re able to dish out and take hits that would probably kill other people. Punch a therianthrope through a wall, and survive being punched through a wall. A Heart Warrior’s transformation gives them a magical girl costume and an identity-obscuring ‘blur’ effect around their face. This is why nobody knows the civilian personas of Heart Warriors. They may have a weapon as a part of their costume or powers, like a scepter, sword, or bow. 
Dual Class: Your Heart powers have developed in two different ways - like Bruiser/Blaster or Master/Guardian. You will have the strengths of both classes, but also their weaknesses, though if you pick two classes that make up for each other’s flaws you’ll come out ahead. You don’t have more starting powers, but you’ll have twice the range to choose from. "
94,,400CP,Trap-master ,Omega Labyrinth Life,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The Holy Caves are littered with traps, ranging from the ones you might expect: poison arrows, lightning runes, explosives, to the kind that you could only find at an academy as lewd as La Belles Fleur. Such as temporarily turning the victim into a floating set of panties, causing someone to slip on ‘lube,’ or, such horror, shrinking a woman’s breasts! You are now endowed with the knowledge and ability on how to create all of these traps, lewd and otherwise, at a rate of one every ten minutes. Once set, they are invisible to the naked eye, but magic can detect them. "
95,,400CP,Merge ,Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Want a bigger, better, badder copy of something you already have? Look no further. This allows you to permanently merge items together, even CP items, but the more dissimilar they are, the more potential power is lost in the merge. Two magic swords would usually stack their power, but a magic sword and a magic bow combining would be reduced to one form and reduce the power of the final item a fair amount, though it would still be more powerful than either original. You can't do more than double the power of the strongest original item merged in this way, but you could add lots of bells and whistles that don't directly make it more powerful such as additional elemental affinities. Items that are designed to be merged (like gems) do not have the limitation of doubling their starting power, so if you merge 64 level one gems, you will end up with a level 6 gem."
96,,400CP,Mystic Eyes of Permanence ,Generic Isekai,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Your unusual blood has manifested in the form of a unique set of eyes. These eyes give you the ability to see the structure of magical effects, and spend your own mana to optimize those effects, extending their duration indefinitely. You can create magical flames that burn without fuel, force walls that endure for years, enchantments that never fade, perpetual constructs, and more. Magic you create or modify with the Eyes can still be broken or dispelled, but will remain forever if left undisturbed."
97,,400CP,Natural magic ,Ravenwood,Domain: Skills: Magic,"People are not the only things afflicted with the corruptive influence of the Demiplane, the trees, the stone, the metal, everything possesses some degree of taint from this cursed plane of existence. And now you can use that to your advantage. You possess an innate understanding towards the mystical properties of nearly all materials within (and outside) the Demiplane, and how to shape them. By cutting gems, forming metal, grinding stone, and putting all the disparate pieces together, you can create artificial spell matrices that naturally generate and collect magical energies and can shape them into spell effects. While not often the prettiest things around, these artifacts are capable of granting magic to even the uninitiated. However, it takes precise craftsmanship and extensive design periods to make even basic items.
This perk also extends to the creation of potions. These are much simpler to create compared to artifacts, requiring only the right herbs, water, and a catalyst of magical energy, which can be provided by even the most basic of spell matrices. Additionally, any similar skills in future jumps, can be replicated with study using this perk."
98,,400CP,Portal Creation ,Generic Builder,Domain: Skills: Magic,"While every Builder can eventually learn to create portals through research or scanning enough other examples, you start knowing how to craft portals and you're particularly good at doing it cheaply both in terms of magic and in terms of material. Not only that but you have a knack for creating portals with interesting access restrictions that are almost impossible to bypass if you so choose."
99,,400CP,Portalist ,Timespinner,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Vilete once knew the secret for making portals that were capable of spanning interplanetary distances, and now, you know that secret as well. You have the knowledge and skill to be able to craft portals between different locations in space. Something within the range of a city can be done 'freestyle', using only your own Aura, though you may need to charge up energy beforehand. Longer range portals would need anchors and magical focuses, but you know how to craft such very easily. Through practice and study, the range of your personal portals and permanent portals can both expand, with personal portals eventually reaching intercontinental distances, while your permanent portals could eventually reach between stars.
FREE: Aura - You possess the power of aura. Aura is something that bridges the divide between psychic powers and magic, being halfway between both. You can telekinetically manipulate the world around you to a limited degree, light fires, strengthen your body, boost your reflexes, etc. Aura is primarily used via Orbs, which will be discussed later. Your Aura level is slightly above average, by the lower standards of Lachiem, and slightly below average by the high standards of Vilete. In other words, you are overall very average. However, it is possible for this power to grow, given time, training, and use. As this power is halfway between a psychic power and magic, it can act as a bridge between other powers you have that fall in those areas. If you already possess psychic or magic powers, or if you gain them in the future, this power can draw on those powers' sources for energy, provide energy to them, or be used as a conduit for channeling energy between those powers.
FREE: Paradox Proof - You will not be at risk of being erased or removed from time due to alterations to the timeline. When such changes happen, the area around you will shift to reveal the new timeline, and you will retain general memories of the prior timeline as well as gaining new memories from the new one. Time will bend to ensure that in the new timeline, you aren't in immediate danger following the shift. In this Jump in particular, such a shift will happen moments after someone travels to the past, with any and all changes they make occurring at once."
100,,400CP,Power! Unlimited Power!,Lords of the Nights - Liches,Domain: Skills: Magic,"While many Liches eventually become true believers in the cause, that's not how they started out. Their roots go back to hidden corners where a young wizard with more ambition and curiosity than sense discovered lore they weren't ready for, and started off on a journey to seize true might. Maybe some grow beyond that, but most don't. Whatever is the case, your magical growth is potent and many faceted. You can craft anything a mortal wizard could - any feat of craftsmanship short of the epic is yours. The understanding is solid enough to act as a prerequisite for you seeking more transcendent craftsmanship.
You may also freely add a certain level of metamagic to anything you cast - up to the same limit as what you can cast normally. A Wizard who can cast fourth level spells could freely add up to four circles worth of metamagic without making the spell harder to cast. This empowerment doesn't need to happen in advance, and can instead be applied to spells as they are cast, taking no extra time to do so. Lastly, whenever they deepen their connection to the Arcane, more aspects of magic reveal themselves. Every Arcane 'Feat' they achieve, helps them achieve another three feats of magic - Metamagic, Reserve, Spell Penetration, or something else appropriate."
101,,400CP,Seed Weaving ,Nexus 2.0,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The technique known as Seed Weaving is an advanced form of Seed Sorcery, specifically in the creation of the Seed itself. You cycle Seeds around and through each other, effectively linking them into a sort of braid, which has the effect of growing each Seed slightly faster. However, the main benefit of this technique lies in the increased flexibility, as each Seed may be Cracked to fuel each other rather than simply their own effect, even combining their effects if multiple Seeds are Cracked at once. This technique also frees any Seeds so they may move within the user's Light, allowing it to be moved and used to enhance the body when it normally wouldn't be able to, a fact that makes hunters that know this technique quite dangerous to fight as they can maintain far more Seeds than more restricted Seed Sorcerers. The process to learn this technique is difficult, requiring years of training to accomplish, and most won't be able to do more than a single Weaving at once. You, however, are skilled in the technique, able to weave up to four Seeds in a single Weaving and up to three such Weavings at the same time. You may teach others to use this technique."
102,,400CP,Thaumcraft ,Minecraft,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You are a powerful mage, and can break items down into their pure Aspects, then reweave those Aspects into more useful forms. With time and research, you'll be able to transmute items into other items, create powerful magical items, imbue wands with spells both useful and deadly, and create golem servitors to carry out your whims. Beware, though; Thaumaturgy is a delicate art, and any mistakes can Taint the land, twisting the land to evil and all creatures within it into deadly and malicious forms. The Thaumonomicon, a magical book you'll create early on in your research, will help you get started, and give hints as to what to do next."
103,,400CP,The Ancient Music ,Dishonored 2,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Underlying all of reality and even the Void is a musical phenomenon, and study of this underpinning force is something you have devoted your life so far to. As a result, you can design and build devices to take advantage of a 17-note scale derived from this music - the orgels the Overseers hold in such high regard being the most obvious application. If you are able to reproduce the notes correctly, they will disrupt the effect of foul magicks around you - actually, any magics at all, foul or fair. Singing bone charms will become silent, witches will no longer be able to draw on their supernatural oddities, and creatures made with magic - partially or whole - will be unable to approach you while the notes play. With the right device, you can even use the scale to project blasts of sound to knock back and disorient witches who keep their distance. While the effect is a blanket one, disrupting all magic, friend's or foe's, with significant research you could discover harmonies or sub-scales in order to affect only certain types of magic."
104,,500CP,Spiritual Array Master | Book of Array Diagrams | Cultivation ,The Great Ruler,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Spiritual Array Master (400CP) Making a Spiritual Array is simply a special method of resonating Spiritual Energy. It will activate the Spiritual Aura within the world, creating both offensive and defensive measures. Spiritual Arrays are made up of Spiritual Seals. The more powerful and talented someone is, the more seals they can make. The more complex the array, the more seals are needed. Seal masters are divided into 9 ranks, 1 to 9, each much harder to reach than the last, though the actual ranks are slightly more complicated after the 5th rank. Few people will even be able to reach the 5th rank. Despite it sounding simple, once you get to the threshold of a rank making the next seal becomes much harder, similar to making a breakthrough in cultivation.
You have been trained up to 3rd rank, able to create more than 100 seals. Nothing groundbreaking but impressive nonetheless. But you also have an advantage that would make many envious; you have the potential to enter the Heart Array State at will, allowing you to improve your array skills extremely quickly, as well as increasing your ability in its use while in the state. Keep training and you can eventually enter the higher forms of it like the Heart Eye State which greatly increases your array capability.
Book of Array Diagrams (100CP) Having the ability to create and summon array seals is all well and good, but it is next to useless if you do not know any of the ways to arrange them in order to create an array. There are hundreds of different kinds of arrays one can make and a single misstep will cause your array to collapse. This book that you have found yourself with contains the formula for several arrays of your skill level. This book also gives details into creating your own arrays and a bit into how they work. A good starter guide if you ever wanted to teach others. These arrays will range from defensive ones, to attacking ones, to illusion ones.
Cultivation (0CP) You gain the ability to cultivate, starting off at the Spiritual Movement Stage. The cultivation of the Great Thousand Worlds is Spiritual Power. If you happen to have already cultivated Dou Qi from Battle Through The Heavens, you will find that the Dou Qi has the unique ability to convert itself into the purer Spiritual Power. This means that you can essentially choose to integrate your two cultivations together and boost your Spiritual Power to high levels immediately, or keep them separate. The cultivation of the Thousand Worlds goes several realms higher than that of Dou Qi, so it can become much stronger. There are 12 stages of the cultivation of Spiritual Power, with each stage being split into a variety of levels. In the more backwater places, you would be lucky to find someone who has reached the level of Heavenly Fusion, while in the more populated areas it is not uncommon to find Sovereign class cultivators.
In the Spirit Stage of the Spiritual Energy cultivation path, one has the ability to ingest the Soul Essence of a Spiritual Beast. However, there is a limit to the Soul Essence. As you get stronger, the Soul Essence that you have refined before will gradually lose its effect. This means that most essences will lose their effect before the Heavenly Completion Stage. However, if the Soul Essence that you have refined is powerful enough, the power will still remain even in the later level, giving those that have them an edge.
Reaching the Sovereign Stage marks a major change in your cultivation. One must pass through 3 'disasters' where your body, energy, and soul are refined to a higher grade, yet failure is easy and can carry fatal consequences. Once you reach pass these trials and reach the Sovereign stage you will gain the Sovereign Sea, which is a much more powerful container for your Spiritual Power. The spiritual energy itself of Sovereign Masters possesses unique attributes. Some people's spiritual energies are cold in nature, and some are blazing hot. This is because their spiritual energies have their own sagacities depending on what kind of energies they take in and have attuned it to.
Sovereigns also gain the ability to cultivate a Sovereigns Body which, depending on the rank, can give them great physical power. There are certain Celestial Body techniques one can cultivate to gain a more powerful Sovereigns Body, though they are often closely guarded secrets of clans.
By pouring your Spiritual Power into someone else, you can awaken their ability to cultivate, not that that will do them much good without further guidance."
105,,500CP,Skill Level(Magic&Alchemy related) ,Rance 02,Domain: Skills: Magic,"All living beings with a soul that are born within the Planner Scenario have Skill Levels set by birth. Even those who hail from other planets or dimensions gain this upon entering the world and never lose it. Nearly everything has skill levels, including daily skills such as cooking and cleaning. Skill levels determines the expertise of the person's skill in any given field, or better said, their talent at the skill. While levels are increased the more one trains, skill levels are set in stone by birth, and do not rise or fall. 
Level 0 (Free)  Makes the individual capable of effectively doing the task normally, but without any particular aptitude for it. Most people tend to have dozens of skills at this level. 
Level 1 (100CP) Relative talent that lets the user perform the skill up to a professional level, while it’s not bad by any means, one shouldn’t expect to gain fame with this alone. For example, Sill Plain possess a Level 1 Skill at Magic, while she is decent in the magic arts and can use it effectively in battle, there’s a lack of power and versatility. 
Level 2 (200CP)  At this point the user is a genius at their skill. More than enough to create unique signature abilities. Respected swordsmen like Rick Addison or Rance have a Sword Combat Skill of Level 2, it what lets them create their special attacks. For comparison Shizuka Masou also possess a Level 2 Skill at Magic. 
Level 3 (500CP) This level is basically legendary, and the user is the best of the best at the skill. Few people in history had a skill at this level and their potential is insanely high. As example, Annise Sawatari has the Magic Skill Level 3 and easily overpowers any other mage in the Continent. Even with little finesse and experience, the raw power of her spells can easily exceed the combined effort of 2000 mages."
106,,600CP,Celestial Kabbalah ,Unsong,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You have a deep understanding of the relationships between higher powers and base reality, the mechanisms that make the intangible tangible. What this means for you is that you can intuitively perceive the operations and organizational forces underpinning the universe around you; this includes conventional physics, but also more abstract forces such as destiny, Adam Kadmon, narrative causality, the operations of any magic systems, and more. With this deep insight, you can reach into the beating heart and grinding gears of these forces if you dare and manipulate them, or even carry out works of truly cosmic engineering. You might hedge out natural law, alter the parameters of a magic system and adjust its limits, rejigger the mechanisms of fate and destiny, or even run your own universe by means of magic or technology."
107,,600CP,Crystal Magic ,Avernum,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The magic of the Vahnatai a hidden and enigmatic race, you can manipulate Crystals to use them for magic. It is a powerful art, capable of making anything from magical grenades, to Crystals that act as a focus for magic, to even enshrining a person's soul into a crystal, and more."
108,,600CP,Crystal Working ,Geneforge,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You intrinsically know how to work crystals and form them into useful magical systems, if you observe such a system you would know how to recreate it, and likely how to make it better. This will work on any magic that you understand, as a bonus you know how to create the intricate crystal systems that are part of the geneforge."
109,,600CP,Fleshcrafter ,Claymore,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You know the processes behind the creation of Half Yoma, Abyss Feeders, and even just cobbling together flesh into a rather long lived, and hard to kill body. If it's a secret known to the organization of working flesh anything from humans to Asarakam, you know it all, and can even go beyond in time. You do at least know exactly how to ensure that every half yoma you produce is at a level near the top ranks of warriors within the organization. With a little effort you could find a way to produce them without a stigma, or create ones that don't show their nature through bleaching their body of pigment and turning their eyes silver."
110,,600CP,Doctor Stylish ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Styles are quite special, even among Skills. Makeable, if you know the right way, and capable of just as much power and even some things Skills cannot do. You're a Stylist equal to Fukurou, the creator of Styles, himself. Just by constantly using, considering and playing with a certain phrase, idiom, way of using words or other word-related game, you can create new styles. Things on the level of Provocation Style might take just a few weeks whilst a mid-level style like Label User or Kanji user might take months of repetition. The high level stuff can take years or even longer to make, such as Contradictory Conjunction, but is still possible if you are patient and uninterrupted in your work. You'll also find that you effortlessly master any sort of word-based supernatural power, possessing much more strength than any of your peers would with the same sorts of powers at your normal Level.
Capstone Boosted: The next step of Styles is to take them from being original to converting other things into Styles. You're able to create new Styles by converting existing power and abilities you have into Styles, though this does not remove the original version of the power. The power will still require any energy or material costs as normal and possesses most of the same drawbacks but any sort of physical action required or time requirement is reduced to just a few words needing to be spoken by you. You could be able to cast any of your fire spells simply by saying Fire with different inflections and tones or unleash barrages of blasts of kinetic forces by reciting technique names from martial arts."
111,,600CP,Fantasy Seal ,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You have great aptitude when it comes to creating barriers, sealing, and undoing those seals yourself. What this means is that anything, no matter how strong, can be sealed away by you. Even when you encounter the supposedly “invulnerable” and “unsealable” you will always be able to find a hidden gap, a secret weakness, that makes them vulnerable to your sealing. Breaking seals can be a fiddly, fine process to do if you want to preserve whatever object was used as the sealing instrument, though if you don’t care about that you can always simply brute force it to instantly annihilate the seal. To be able to break any seal, no matter how powerful, is your “cheat skill”."
112,,600CP,Glyph Magic ,Thief,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You've been trained in the secret art of glyph magic. By writing it down on a surface you can activate the magic. Eventually your skill might grow to the point where you can ""draw"" in the air. There are Battle Glyphs that are utilized in battle, such as attacking or for defensive purposes like invisibility. Utility Glyphs allow you to augment something, such as augmenting a statue with animation, or closing another glyph. Stationary Glyphs are permanent, they allow things like locking a door, or a chair to the ground, or perhaps even opening a secret door. These are just some of the possibilities that were presented in the games, but perhaps you will find creative uses for all these glyphs. Additionally you've been granted the secrets of the transformation glyphs used for Glyph Enhanced perk, allowing you to enhance those that serve under you."
113,,600CP,I Am The Architect ,Solo Leveling,Domain: Skills: Magic,"It would be an understatement to call you a genius, Jumper. Your mind is one that only has a single peer in the universe when it comes to your technological and magical knowledge. You have mastered the magics of the Monarchs and Rulers, allowing you to create pocket worlds of your own, opening portals to them, existing into another dimensional space and puppeteering powerful avatars, replicating abilities such as the Ruler's Authority with your own magic, as well the creation of such powerful puppets, capable of dealing evenly with S-Ranked dungeon bosses. Finally, your ability would allow you to replicate the feats of The Architect, creating a System for any ability of yours or others, either obtained willingly or forcibly, to train others into. As the Administrator of this System, however, you could also, at any point, seal or take the powers that you have granted access to at any point. You can combine your previous talents to create 'Quests' and 'items' that would help those 'Players' to level up and get better at using their abilities. You can only have a maximum of eight active 'Players' of this system, but you can permanently separate them from The System once they have matured enough with their powers without them losing their powers"

You're a magical prodigy that could one day reach the same level of power as Bezel himself if you pushed yourself hard enough, but that could take decades if not centuries of studying and practice."
115,,600CP,Merlin Returned ,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Domain: Skills: Magic,"There were ancient tales of your coming, Jumper. Actually, wait, no. There weren't. But there should have been. You were born to greatness, and this reflects in everything you do. Magic is second nature to you. While you don't get any skill or knowledge innate with this perk, nor any gifts or talents that pass down bloodlines or through rituals, you now have limitless talent in every single branch of magic apart from these limitations. Besides that, you are a genius at learning magic too, mastering years' worth of material in days and weeks without even stressing yourself. This growth continues indefinitely, never slowing no matter what. Your grasp of magic and its theoretical framework is such that you can manipulate the very nature of it, and do so with an almost contemptuous ease. You can take apart spells, rituals or even entire magic systems, and put them back together in whatever different arrangement you like, even in entirely new magic systems of your own. Even altering spells in real time is second nature to you, changing their effects, size, scope, everything. As is coming up with entirely new pieces of magic, with due research and innovation.
Finally, to fuel all this, your 'Magical Core', per se, is proportionately vast. You have a humongous amount of magic at your fingertips, stretching far and beyond any known metrics well into the realm of legends like Merlin and the Founders. This perk follows you in the future too, providing you all of these effects in any and all magic you become able to do. This perk is a capstone booster, meaning that it serves to enhance each of the origin capstones in their own ways. The interactions are mentioned alongside the respective perks."

Now older, you've put your heart and soul into refining that artistic talent to the point it became a bit...mad in the process, Jumper. You can manipulate 2D and flat 3D images in impossible ways like making non-magical paintings talk, turning a picture of running shoes into actual running shoes, and if you draw a T-Rex bursting out of the wall with chalk it can attack and drag people into the wall with it, and many more strange things besides. You also have a close connection with the things you draw as well as the 2D dimension and can interact with them in strange ways. Draw a dark tunnel with an exit at the end and you can walk through it like a portal, stick your hand to a flat wall and become a 2D cartoon painting that can move and travel through deep cracks to enter rooms, even create traps just by drawing them where people will step. You can do all this and more, Jumper, so long as you have the materials or viable surfaces, as your artistic talent could make Michelangelo weep if you put enough thought into it."

You possess immense talent for dark magics such as the life-draining Nosferatu or the twisted necromancy that animates the Risen, and can wield these magics without suffering any ill effects or corruption from them. This protection also applies to any similar forms of dark or corrupted power you might acquire in future jumps, allowing you to use your own darkness in place of any outside force that might attempt to corrupt you to its own ends.

In addition to granting you enormous talent for sacred magic, your magical power has innate holy qualities which can be added freely to any abilities you already possess, making them burn away unholy powers such as dark magic with greatly increased effectiveness. Your divine essence also allows you to smite unruly dragons with sword or spell, dealing vastly-increased damage to them. Given many years to grow into your power you could eventually learn to wield your magic as Naga does, even crossing time and space and allowing for the creation of sacred artifacts endowed with your power like Falchion or the Fire Emblem.

No Linking Book will be able to return you to any world but your current jump, so long as your chain continues. Furthermore, without a genuine understanding of the nature of dimensions, any new world you create with a Descriptive Book will be another Minecraft-type world, cursed to Decay into nothingness over the course of a week or so. This can be a handy way to gather resources without disrupting a 'real' world, or a good place to experiment with dangerous things, but nothing more... at least for now. Be sure to keep your Linking Books handy and your Descriptive Books safe; should you lose your Linking Book, you will be trapped within a doomed world, and should the Descriptive Book that defines a world be destroyed while you are in it, you will be destroyed alongside it. Careful searching of these worlds may turn up hints of forgotten lore that you can use to improve your skills, but the rotten fragments of paper you find in these decaying libraries will raise more questions than they answer."

All it would take is following your instincts to allow you to transform it into an Omega Dao. Be careful however because a Dao like this means an even harder time passing the Daomerge.
* Formation in this setting is a means of channelling energy. It takes material and time to set up. Uses include concentrating ambient energy, defensive formations, and joining peoples magic together for more powerful attacks. A Omega dao is the highest class of dao, meaning this perk sets you on the path to becoming literally perfect with the settings version of runes.
* Dao is essentially the laws of heavens that cultivators learn to control reality. Omega laws are essentially merging all your laws into the one law to make it supreme. It is also required for reaching the perk of cultivation. So for example a omega dao of formations would allow you to create universe and multiverses with formations."
122,,600CP,Real v Fake ,Monogatari Series,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Truth, despite what you may have heard, is not a single, clear-cut and defined answer. It is malleable, changing to fit the definition of the one seeking it. Nowhere is this clearer than the debate on whether a fake thing can surpass the real thing or not. You have a certain ability based on what is real and what is fake, depending on which of the three options below you pick from. You may buy this perk multiple times, though each option is only discounted to Specialists.
The first option is to believe that what is real will always trump what is not. You gain the ability to make any real thing automatically trump over any fake copies over that same real thing, such as making a genuine legendary sword always cut straight through any replicas made of that legendary sword, and that these real things will also possess a strong advantage against any fake thing in general, such as a genuinely made shield being much stronger against imaginary bullets or magical fire.
The second option is to believe that there is no actual difference between a fake and the real thing. This allows you to treat good quality fake things as if they were actually the real thing, even if they don't match exactly. Those fake legendary swords, even if they are normally significantly weaker than the real deal, can instead become the real thing in full at your command.
The final option is for you to believe that fake things can eventually surpass the real thing, if they earnestly try for such a thing. With this, you can force fake copies of things to slowly grow in power until they are twice as good as the original real thing and then improve further so long as they are constantly used. Those fake blades might not be as good as the real deal"

Furthermore, you do have an ability for making the best of any magic aptitude you may have, pushing the boundaries of your Skill Level to the maximum. Even if your natural talent only lets you use the most basic spells, you will find yourself being able to put yourself in equal footing with those more blessed for the magic arts, with little trouble.

Your talent for magic is on the level of an isekai cheat skill, its rules and workings seeming plain as an open book to your eyes. Your talent appears nearly limitless to any mentors you may have, but you hardly need them when you can decipher the workings of a spell just by seeing it performed for you, though even you will still need practice to master a new spell. You’re not limited merely to learning and casting spells either: you can grasp the very foundations of a magical world, hacking apart spells, rituals, and even entire arcane systems and putting them back together in brand new forms of your own creation. You could even create your own system from scratch, spliced together from the many forms of magic you’re certain to encounter on your journey, taking the strengths of each part and fusing them all together into a single magnificent whole. "
125,,600CP,Black Mass Production ,World of Tentacles,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Through perverse experimentation and forbidden research you have uncovered the secrets of producing horrors beyond imagining, in numbers beyond belief. Whenever you summon or create creatures, you are able to produce twice as many as you would normally be able, at no extra cost in time, materials, or effort. Creatures that you personally bring into the world can be made be twice as fertile as usual if you wish, increasing their odds of siring or conceiving offspring as well as the chances of multiple spawn per birth. Should you incorporate perverse methods into the production process you can take things further: for instance, a ritual that normally summons a single demon (and would call up two with the basic form of this perk) will instead bring forth three monsters if you perform a virgin(ity) sacrifice, four if you add a couple of extra participants, five with a full-blown orgy, and so on. There is no cap on the number of extra creatures that can be acquired in this manner, so long as you can meet the escalating costs. 
Note: This gives access only to magical versions of this setup. "
126,,600CP,Reshaping ,Geneforge,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Normally applying shaping magic to a living creature in some way other than an attempt at healing them will cause horrific and rather random results. Though much of shaping was developed by doing this, and carefully studying the results, truly modifying a living being to a great degree is impossible to control without carefully crafted essence, or incredibly complicated equipment such as the geneforge itself. You however have an innate ability to understand what you are doing and control the results."
127,,600CP,Cute And Cuddly ,Generic Hentai Magical Girl,Domain: Skills: Magic,"But, a good judge of character, supportive, knowledgeable, those are all secondary. The real thing you need is to be cute and cuddly. For getting the maximum number of hugs that squeeze you into their boobs. Pick an ordinary-ish animal. You now have a miniaturized form that looks like one, stuffed animal looks optional. When in that form, it's basically impossible to detect any actual powers from you, other than a limited shape-changing ability. Better yet, you'll get a power boost after exiting it, and the longer you stay in that form, the bigger the boost. "
128,,600CP,Demon Sorcerer ,Submission Sailor Moon,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Youma are creatures born from Chaos and magic, and the greatest of their number, like yourself, have immense talent for the arcane arts. A Senshi’s magic might be the power of a planet given form but yours is the power to dominate and enslave the universe, bending even the laws of physics with your iron will. While your spells lack the raw power of the Senshi you have far more flexibility in your magical arsenal, from simple energy blasts to flight and teleportation to curses and seals and much more. This is to say nothing of all the more perverse uses for your magical power, such as brainwashing ordinary men into lustful beasts. What’s more, your demonic nature allows you to use lust as a medium for magical power: not only do your own spells become more powerful the more lustful you become, but your enemies also become less resistant to your magic as their own ardor grows. A Sailor Senshi or other beings resistant to magic might normally shrug off a curse but bring them to orgasm a few times and you’ll rip through their defenses like wet paper and turn their bodies into playthings for your spells. "
129,,600CP,Dragon Blood ,Rance 03,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The lost power of the dragons still exists within you. Once a powerful and wise race, they were wiped out by the gods for being too pacific and peaceful. Yet, their strength was a real deal and what remains on your blood is prove enough. First off, your level cap is doubled (unless you didn’t have one in first place), while also receiving a medium-grade boost to all your gains when leveling up or training. Last but not least, you also possess a dragon alt-form in which all your abilities, stats and powers are multiplied hundredfold. "
130,,600CP,Emissary of Light ,Milk Hunters,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Pretty Cures are those empowered by the Queen of the Garden of Light to fight against the forces of the Dotsuku Zone. This gives them the ability to transform into Pretty Cures. This transformation grants the girls greater physical abilities, the ability to shoot energy attacks, and a cute outfit. If you’ve ever watched a magical girl anime, I’m sure that you’re familiar with the concept. Unlike Nagisa and Honoka, however, your power is completely internal, so you won’t need to use a Card Commune and the Queen Card to transform. You also don’t need a partner to transform, being able to do so on your own. "
131,,600CP,Ritualist ,Ravenwood,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Ritual magic is an extensive form of arcane practice that allows those using it to accomplish great works even as fairly weak mages. You have gained considerable knowledge, both practical and theoretical, on the workings of ritual magic and, by extension, sacrificial blood magic. This allows you to create far reaching and incredibly powerful spell matrices that can be supplied over time by anyone, or fuelled by the life force of sacrificed creatures or blood. Such spell matrices last much longer than common spells, able to persist for weeks on a single casting. Additionally, each casting can be built up over time, allowing it to be stretched out in small portions that, if interrupted, can be restarted without losing all the progress made on the ritual. Even fast rituals, using sacrifices of life force (from yourself or a suitable sacrifice), can be quite persistent, lasting hours where a similar spell would only survive minutes. This is extensively used by the races of the demiplane to create Rituals of Propagation, complex rituals that can be used to turn humanoids into another race, designated by the ritual design. An individual may undergo multiple such rituals, but may become unstable, either physically or mentally, if too many are done without enough recovery time between such uses, which can take several years. You and your companions will automatically recover at the start of each new jump."
132,,600CP,Grey and Gray ,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Morality is an odd thing, and one you could debate about for days on end without an answer. Maybe there isn’t one, especially given this sliding scale. By pointedly focusing on something or someone, and injecting as much opposing energy into it as you can, you switch it’s metaphorical alignment. Casting your most powerful ice spell at a fire sword will make an ice one, healing a zombie will revive it, or having a priest sleep with a succubus might turn it into a (minor, weak, and probably about to fall) angel. "
133,,600CP,Guardian ,Submission Sailor Moon,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Aha! I knew there was something familiar about you! You’ve secretly been a reincarnated prince of the Moon Kingdom this whole time! In the blink of an eye you can transform into a superpowered alter ego like Tuxedo Mask or the Moonlight Knight. While transformed you gain physical abilities equal to any of the Senshi or a powerful youma, becoming tough enough to shrug off being hit by a truck and strong enough to lift and throw one. You can also cast a variety of spells such as illusions and teleportation, allowing you to support the more battle-focused Senshi from a distance. You can even conjure small objects such as roses, knives, or playing cards, and use them as deadly thrown weapons capable of being enchanted with simple magic, the perfect thing to help break the heroines out of traps or distract their enemies for a crucial moment. "
134,,600CP,High Elf ,World of Lewd Elves,Domain: Skills: Magic,"When the goddess was making an elf kind she paid special attention when crafting the High Elves, whose purpose is to serve her as guardians of their kind and priestesses of her will. As a result High Elves have a slew of powerful traits and abilities that have them stand out from normal elves. Your bloodline, in addition to granting you a powerful raw talent in magic and a lifespan measured in millenia instead of centuries, also allows you to sense the flow of the world’s magic around you, detecting any irregularities so that they can be corrected. The most potent ability of the High Elves however, is that they each are born with a divine connection to the goddess, and through that connection can cast potent ‘miracles’ that she channels through your body. While many of these miracles are of a more minor note, such as healing the sick or restoring the stamina of an exhausted elven warrior, occasionally she even deigns to grant powerful boons to her chosen, allowing them to call down vicious storms or arouse the spirits of nature to attack your enemies. Additionally, since they share a direct connection with the Goddess, other elves were spiritually programmed to treat them and their words with religious reverence that exceeds even the authority of elven monarchs, so you have a lot more social leeway and influence for whatever tasks you need done. As an added bonus, since the Goddess desired her chosen to stand above other elves, you are surprisingly tall too and possess much longer (and more sensitive) ears than the common elf. While High Elves are uniformly female, I’ll allow you to become one as a male if you so wish. The miracles the goddess grants you are especially potent if you are bathed in her divine mana near the Divine Trees. Be careful though as the farther you go from the Divine Trees (and the mana of the goddess) the weaker your miracles will get. If say, some random humans were to knock you out and bring you back to one of their cities or a magically warded area you’d be vulnerable to whatever deviant desires they may have. Any High Elf who finds themselves in this situation will find the voice of the goddess oddly silent to their pleas for help. Oddly enough the few lust corrupted High Elves that exist claim that the Goddess has not abandoned them, instead gazing over in the perversions they are committing to the point where the High Elf can feel the intensity of her presence. One of these High Elves even went so far as to say that they heard a soft moaning on the other side of their connection to the Goddess. But that’s probably just falsehoods they use to justify their debauchery. "
135,,600CP,Holy Light ,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Skills: Magic,"With survival comes hope, and with hope comes miracles. You possess the ability to channel large amounts of energy with can only be described as capital H Holy. When unleashed, it will act as the bane of everything even tangentially related to demons or other evil creatures, and start to purge their influences from you and those within its range. It won't technically do much for mental trauma, but the events it tries to erase will leave less impact on the minds of the afflicted. "
136,,600CP,Scientific Magic ,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Magicians in Gensokyo are similar to scientists in the outside world. Magic is conducted through trial and error, when one magician makes a breakthrough others find it relatively easy to copy it. This includes you; for you can easily find ways to duplicate any spell you know exists, even translating it from different magic systems into ones you know. This includes magic to extend your life indefinitely, and indeed is part of why in recent years mages have achieved immortality younger than ever before."
137,,600CP,Soul Study ,The Weakness Of Beatrice,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The core of existence, at least for natural life forms. You've put countless long hours into studying that soul that lies at the centre of your being and the souls of other people as well. Slowly, you mastered this art, gaining the knowledge of how to interact with and manipulate the soul itself. You know how to physically interact with and move souls from one vessel to another, to create souls from nothing, to give physical form for souls to inhabit, to directly alter and change the soul itself and even how to bring back souls of those who have very recently passed on, saving them from death. To many, what you do is both a miracle and blasphemy, both of the highest order. To you though, it's just another science."
138,,600CP,Spellmaker ,Morroblivion,Domain: Skills: Magic,You are talented at creating new spells from trial and error. They tend to be relatively efficient in terms of magicka expenditure and can incorporate various effects. Creating new effects is time consuming but possible.
139,,600CP,It’s For a Ritual! ,Submission Sailor Moon,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Even in a world of magical girls and demons, never underestimate the power of a Shinto priest! Much like Rei’s grandfather and his friends you’ve mastered a wide array of holy magics, from rituals that cleanse demons to the making of ofuda and sacred talismans. These are sacred magical arts that heal, protect, bless, and cleanse or seal evil rather than the curses or elemental magics that a youma or a Senshi might employ. However your rituals have a strange quirk to them in that they become much more powerful when employed in lewd ways. For instance you can cleanse a girl of evil spirits with a normal purification ritual or you can make her actively repel and burn demons that try to lay hands on her with a ritual that involves rubbing a sacred aphrodisiac lotion into every inch of her body. What’s more, by employing these rituals with other kinds of magic you might have you can add sacred power to any other magical spell or effect you might know, turning even ordinary elemental magic into sacred demon-slaying magic. You can also choose to employ non-Shinto rituals if you’d rather be powered by some other religion instead. "
140,,600CP,Lineage of Witchcraft ,Evening Starter,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You come from a long family line of magicians and witches, Jumper. Because of this, you have dozens of generations of knowledge and lore in your possession, especially in a specific magic your family found a niche in. This means spells from that niche were many times more potent than some average scrub would cast them. It also means you have reserves of magic power greater than many of those cheating cultists and their inhuman blood. To make it even better, the efficiency and potency of the Blood is Magic... and ...Magic is Power perks that have greatly increased as well. "
141,,600CP,Magical Girl ,Fate/Loli Order,Domain: Skills: Magic,"For all that the Engineer treated the trio as living sex toys at his whim, the fact of the matter remains that Illya, Kuro, and Miyu are still decently powerful magical girls. That said, the three of them had little to no knowledge of or training in the art of actual magic. However, for the sake of simplicity you now have the very basics of what they were able to accomplish. A few varieties of simple magical blasts, a flight technique, a skywalking technique, and a decent ability to sense magical energy. However, since that’s rather lackluster, you’re also extremely inspiring. Your previously noted optimism and cheerfulness are now such that you can infect - er, inspire - those feelings in people who don’t believe in them anymore. Maybe even in those who literally can’t feel them. "
142,,600CP,Memories of Summer ,Fate/Horse Order,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Speaking of a hell of a vacation, let's talk about Chaldea’s cheap ass summoning system. Half the time it doesn’t even give you a servant, spitting shards and fragments of Spirit Origins known as Craft Essence. While you aren’t any luckier with the damnable Gatcha, you have learned to make your own from the... eventful life you’re surely living. With the materials for a summoning ritual, some blood and a bit of silver, you can pull the memories out of your head and into a small crystal. Hand it off to someone and they’ll find themselves empowered by the memory of the times you spent together. A fabulous feast on the beach might cause them to slowly heal their wounds, while downing far too much of a delicious yet dubious concoction might fortify your body against damage, and an grand orgy might increase your stamina and endurance. Unfortunately, each person can only benefit from a single memory at any given time, but you can combine similar memories for a slight boost in effectiveness. "
143,,600CP,Talisman Master ,Talisman Emperor - Mortal Dimension,Domain: Skills: Magic,"While most mortals' exposure to talismans is the small, charm-like items that allow limited use of martial techniques, the Dao of Talismans is a Grand Dao which is the pinnacle of organizing and using other Daos and energy. Purchasing this perk provides you with the benefits of every specialty listed under Master Craftsman, a similar level of knowledge on the creation of the aforementioned minor talismans, mastery of the Dao Insight for Talismans, and the ability to use that Dao to control the power of all of your other Dao Insights to maximize their potential

144,,600CP,Mutant ,Erona,Domain: Skills: Magic,"In the ancient past there once existed a race called the elves, powerful beings with a far greater intellect, physical abilities, magic, and beauty than all of humankind. However, many of that race became enthralled with the pleasure of the flesh degenerating into the creatures known today as orcs and goblins. While they inherited the physical power of their ancestors, they lost all the intellect, magical prowess, and beauty that the elves once possessed. It seems though, some long lost gene has been reactivated in you, granting you intellect far beyond almost every orc and many humans, to the point where you can plan around human tacticians and research and create spells with ease. Your magical abilities are similarly enhanced, and few humans could match your sorcerous power, never mind think a mere orc could surpass them. "
145,,600CP,Omega Artifice,Omega Labyrinth Life,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The pinnacle of mastery at manipulating Omega Power, you can literally use Omega Power to create permanent objects. Naturally, the more powerful the object in question you want to create is the more Omega Power you’ll need, but there are few limits beyond that singular one. Also, whatever you create will be highly receptive to magical augmentation, and you can invent these augmentations yourself using still more Omega Power, or transfer augmentation between items. Either things you find in the Holy Caves or post-Jump. If you should purchase this Perk without acquiring Omega Power Forever, you may apply this Perk to other magical energies: Mana, Ki, etc."
146,,600CP,Perverted Potioneer ,Slave Maker 3,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You know how to create the various potions for sale, in this world. Potions to increase or decrease lust, restore energy, make slaves more obedient, and more.

147,,600CP,Tentacle Knowledge ,eratohoK,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You can easily summon tentacle monsters, turn yourself into a tentacle monster, give people abortion-via-tentacles, even conjure up rooms full of tentacle monsters that will quickly break the spirit and will of most people and reduce them to breeding stock for more tentacles. These tentacles will be your loyal servants and make excellent fodder for an army – indeed since people infested by tentacles can give birth so rapidly you can quickly build a loyal army of tentacle monsters. One person could easily end up birthing the equivalent of thousands of mundane warriors at a time in tentacle monsters. "
148,,600CP,The New Millennium ,Submission Sailor Moon,Domain: Skills: Magic,"These Senshi may be a lot lewder than the original ones but when the chips are down they’re still the guardians of the universe and any monster foolish enough to underestimate them deserves the beatdown they’re about to get. Your Senshi transformation has been massively upgraded into the new Millennium form, and has become an order of magnitude more powerful than an ordinary Senshi. In this state you are capable of channelling enough magical power to wipe out whole scores of youma at a time and can fly at high speeds. Additionally, you can fold other powers you’ve obtained as a Jumper into this transformation, turning them into a part of your Senshi transformation and granting them a similar power boost at the cost of making them unavailable when you’re not transformed. 
Sailor Soldier (Free/Restricted to Senshi) Like every other Senshi you carry the power of a planetary guardian and can transform into a sailor-suited heroine, even if your untransformed state is some other gender. While you are transformed you become much stronger, faster, and tougher than an ordinary human, enough that you could leap several stories in a single bound or fight powerful monsters hand-to-hand. You also wield an element of magic aligned with your planet of choice and can cast spells using that power. At first you will know only a handful of spells, but with time you will grow stronger and more flexible until you gain complete mastery over your element. "

In their hubris most of them wound up assuming forms of limited intelligence or magical ability. Not you. You possess immense magical power capable of great feats like the shaping of the Lust Brands and the creation of whole new breeds of demonic beasts. While you must re-learn all that your magic is capable of, given time and training you might even become capable of interfering with the very fabric of time itself. "

Shianti Origin who select this ability can choose four skills off of this list after paying the cost of the perk. Non Shianti Origin can choose three after paying the cost. Additional skills are 100CP per skill beyond the number allotted by your Origin. Using the Moonstone will enhance the strength and utility of spells from these disciplines.
Sorcery (100CP) This power allows a wizard to transform his thoughts and desires into magical energy. Focusing your energies will allow you to create magical shields or move objects.
Enchantment (100CP) Enchantment enables a wizard to charm or beguile other creatures, and create illusions in the minds of others.
Elementalism (100CP) Minor control over the natural elements of Air, Fire, Earth, and Water. Using this ability requires a trance state. Also, spirits of the Elemental Plane may not understand your request and might answer your call for aid in the manner you did not intend.
Alchemy (100CP) The ability to create potions and solutions to effect objects and individuals.
Prophecy (100CP) Through the use of a meditative state, a wizard can foretell the future. The clarity of the foretelling is tied to the wizard's knowledge of the object or individual in question. Asking about someone or something you know will give more detail than someone or something unknown.
Psychomancy (100CP) The ability to see and read the past by laying hands on an object. Results may be cryptic, and magic can be used to create intentionally misleading results.
Evocation (100CP) The ability to contact the spirit realm and speak with the dead. Spirits communed with may be hostile, requiring the wizard to ward himself, and spirits will require the wizard to perform a task in exchange for any aid rendered.

In particular, this series is quite stressful, I can either give you one that covers the basics of most magic systems or you can choose something more specialized.

153,,800CP,Maker of Magic ,The Weakness Of Beatrice,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The Sage began by learning how to Mix physical things. Then she moved onto magical things. Then she moved onto the soul itself. All of her great works paled in comparison to what she mastered and gave to the world when she first appeared to the public though. Manipulation of the Magic System itself. She turned a traditional system of magic into one like what you'd see in an MMO videogame, changing this magic over two whole worlds. Now that knowledge and ability is yours. You have the ability and knowledge to make widespread changes and alterations to magical systems with a few hours of focus and work. You could make a system based on ritual invocations and sacrifices take on the form of an RPG magic system or vice versa. You can combine systems you already have access to with new ones in however ways you like, add restrictions or even remove limitations and add new aspects, though improving the overall power would require comboing with a stronger magic system you already know. The changes you make are applied to the entirety of the subject Magic System but beings with more power than you are not required to use it, instead being able to rely on the old system if they wish. Those weaker than you are forced to follow all the new rules, unless they themselves can prevent it somehow."
154,,800CP,Restriction/Formation Expert | Cultivation | Formation and Restriction Flags ,Renegade Immortal,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Restriction/Formation Expert (300CP) Formations and restrictions are two different yet similar methods of achieving similar results.
Formations are ordered structures built from materials and powerful resources that can accomplish a variety of tasks, including teleportation across vast distances to pre-set destinations, creating incredibly powerful barriers to keep enemies out or allowing multiple weaker people to work together to create a far more powerful force. One of the most potent examples of formations, one that only late Second Step and Third Step cultivators would know about, is the Realm Sealing Formation, an unimaginably vast sealing formation that separates the Cave World into the Inner and Outer Realms.
Restrictions, on the other hand, require no resources aside from knowledge and the divine sense and they can change according to the will of the user, making them much more dynamic and free-form as compared to formations. The most common use for restrictions is to boobytrap an area, filling a space with manifold restrictions that require long periods of careful study to bypass, lest you step on a blade of grass that will become a storm of blades that simultaneously sets off all the adjacent restrictions and creates a truly dangerous predicament. You have an incredible talent for your chosen discipline, as well as years of experience and a well honed sense of intuition for unknown restrictions or formations. This talent and experience has manifested in a particularly piercing gaze, allowing you see through restrictions, formations and patterns with incredible ease.
Cultivation (0CP) This represents your ability to cultivate, be it your body, your soul, your spirit or stranger things. Whatever the path, you have an average talent with all of them, representing a span of physical potential, mental ability and potency of self. Your willpower is bolstered, enough that the pains and hardships everyone must face are bearable. Focusing on one thing or another for long periods of time is now easy.
Drop-ins start at the first stage of Qi Condensation, but have no method or techniques they didn't buy here. Mortals have no cultivation and thus no method or technique, but still retain the same level of talent as the others, barring any other purchases. Young Cultivators have a method of average value, a small handful of middling techniques and a cultivation mid-way through Qi Condensation. Old Cultivators have a cultivation of early Foundation Establishment, a potent method and a collection of techniques that would make any junior envious.
You aren't restricted in the heights your cultivation can reach, but with just this it's unlikely you'll make it far with just this.
Once you leave this jump you will be able to give other people the ability to cultivate.
Formation and Restriction Flags (500CP) This is a set of formation or restriction flags, created from a great deal of resources, that allow you to easily set up formations, or employ restrictions, on the fly. For 100 CP you receive a set of nine basic formation or restriction flags.
The set of formation flags each have one fairly basic formation that can be set up on any location in moments, and removed just as easily. They contain basic formations such as ones that can gather enough spiritual energy from the surroundings to greatly aid the cultivation of even a Foundation Establishment cultivator, seal areas so that even peak Foundation Establishment cultivators have to go to great lengths to break into them, or link the energies of a set of people inside a certain area so that each of them is as strong as all of them put together, up to the peak of the great circle of Foundation Establishment.
The set of restriction flags contains flags of the same strength except that these contain one restriction each. They contain basic restrictions such as ones that can launch attacks when unauthorized people trespass on certain places, restrictions that can trap locations, doors, chests or items and trigger preset effects when they are interacted with in certain manners, or even restrictions that act like spells and abilities of significant strength and can be used actively in combat.
You can obtain either set for 100 CP and both for 200 CP. Formation Experts receive a basic set of Formation Flags for free and Restriction Experts receive a basic set of restriction flags for free. And both of them can modify and even replace the formations and restrictions in the flags.
For an undiscounted 100 CP you can upgrade all your sets of flags. Upgraded sets have flags that can hold multiple formations or restrictions, up to nine each. The upgraded flags can hold restrictions of any level of strength and the formations or restrictions they hold to start with have increased in strength to the Core Formation level.

However doing so will marginally increase its abilities and give it a new one. You cannot pick said ability but it’ll compliment your own powers well. Any pieces added or replaced on your weapon will be raised to the overall quality of it. 
156,,800CP,Wizard | Soul Source ,Dresden Files,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Wizard (200CP) You're a full-fledged member of the White Council, with all the rights, privileges, and obligations that entails. A lot of times that's more hassle than it's worth, especially with a war on, but there's a lot of resources you can call on when you need to, as long as you're prepared to repay the favor when need be. What this background really gets you is the full training a wizarding background offers, which has left you able to call on the entire array of everything magic is capable of. And, with enough time and preparation, there's very little which doesn't fit within that category. One quick word of warning before taking this background. Once you go Practitioner, you're bound by the Laws of Magic. There's only seven of them, set out by the White Council to prevent the worst corruptions magic poses, and they're there for a good reason. Violating one of the laws isn't just an awful thing to do, it's true black magic - the kind that stains your soul, permanently changing you into the sort of person who does break that law. It's addictive, and the more you break the law the easier it'll be, until you wind up in ""When all you have is a hammer"" scenario. Because of that, there's generally only one sentence for violation: death by decapitation.
1) Thou Shalt Not Kill. Or, at least, not with magic. There's a reason Wardens run around with silver swords, and wizards like to carry handguns as backup. There's a couple of exceptions, mainly centered around clear self defense, but if your magic ends up taking someone out permanently, even completely by accident, you've broken this law.
2) Thou Shalt Not Change Another. In other words, no turning people into newts. There's a bit of a gray area when it comes to transforming yourself, though if you're not a natural talent at it I'd strongly recommend against it, because unless you're Senior Counsel material this sort of magic always ends badly for the target.
3) Thou Shalt Not Invade the Mind of Another. Pretty simple - other people's heads are inviolate, so stay out. The Soulgaze is an exception here, since it's not about looking into the mind but the soul, which is a vastly different experience.
4) Thou Shalt Not Enthrall Another. This one can be a bit tricky; technically, this only refers to uses of magic to directly alter someone's natural inclinations, choices, and behaviors. Threatening to set someone on fire doesn't count, nor does locking them in a magic circle until they agree to your demands, nor catching someone in a Faerie contract. But any time you're stepping into their head and making changes to your liking, you're running afoul of this one.
5) Thou Shalt Not Reach Beyond the Borders of Life. This covers anything related to the subject of necromancy - raising the dead, animating corpses, or even keeping someone from dying when they've suffered a mortal wound. Of course, potential Ectomancers shouldn't be deterred by this; ghosts are just echoes, and magic dealing with them falls well on the right side of the line.
6) Thou Shalt Not Swim Against the Currents of Time. There's not a lot to go on here, because if someone was violating this law, how would we even know about it? It might not even be possible, and this might just be a warning that bad things happen if you try. Still, best to be safe and just leave the time travel to the guys with screwdrivers instead of wands.
7) Thou Shalt Not Open the Outer Gates. You might want to take note of this one, because it's a doozy. This is the only one of the laws that deals with mere knowledge rather than action; you do not research the Outsiders, you do not contact them, you do not ask them for power, you do not go on multiversal road trips for their amusement. Yeah, you're already way afoul of this one, but I won't tell if you won't. Just don't do it here, because the ""local"" Outsiders are Bad News with capital letters.
Now, these rules only apply to mortal practitioners, which means if you're something else you don't really have to worry about it. Of course, that cuts both ways; technically, none of the laws (except Law Seven) apply to anything which isn't human. Burn one of the Black Court to ash with a fireball, raise a zombie T-Rex, and you're still on the right side of the laws, although the Warden who investigates might disagree.
They also only apply to magic as the White Council knows it, which means anything you drag in from elsewhere technically isn't a violation of the first six laws, and won't stain your soul the same way. Of course, they're not going to know the difference, and if they did, it's a violation of the Seventh, so don't go arguing about it.
Soul Source (600CP) Somehow, you've gained the power of Soulfire; the ability to use the energies of your soul to enhance your magic. By infusing a spell with notjust your will, but all your being, it'll be infused with a sort of ""mystic rebar,"" granting it a lot of strength and giving it significantly more structure. Since your self is part of the spell now, it also functions more along the lines of your intentions, rather than just providing you with a raw boost. Of course, this comes at a cost: you're literally burning away part of your soul for power. Souls do heal up, especially when engaged in ""soul-affirming"" activities, but overuse might be worse than fatal."
157,,900CP,Feel It Out | Synchronicity Event ,F.E.A.R.,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Feel It Out (600CP) Your ability to understand machines and designs are more than just knowledge, and anyone who follows your work would know this well. You have a subtle psionic ability to 'understand' the machines and items that you physically touch, to the point where you can understand how it might work. More importantly, what you could do to also make it better. Naturally the more complex or esoteric the item is, the more drastically the time needed increases. But the more information you collect the more ideas and methods you can formulate to begin working.
Synchronicity Event (300CP) [Requires ""Feel It Out""] Curiouser and curiouser. Due to coming into contact with... well, SOMETHING, your psionic abilities have noticeably increased. Psychic powers you may have had are stronger now, with control and development coming more quickly with practice. There is also a boon to this; by taking a few days to 'attune' a person, you may impart upon them the beginning of psionic abilities of their own. You may only gift one school at a time, and they start at the very beginning; if they are to grow and learn as you have, it would be wise to teach them. On the plus side, they'll eventually become as strong as you are, so you'll have quite the pupil on your hands."
158,,900CP,Perverted Mage ,Pokegirls,Domain: Skills: Magic,"You have completed the graduation requirements of the Vale Magical Academy. This includes passing Basic Attack Spells, Basic Defense Spells, and Basic Healing Spells. You have also mastered the Sex and Magic II course which will allow you to quickly master spells of a sexual nature and are exceptionally skilled in perverting regular spells to a sexual purpose. You’re able to come up with perverted copies of spells that you already know or have a copy of in a matter of minutes. Finally, you have succeeded in the final test for three of the Master Courses. The courses are Potions, Attack Spells, Defensive Spells, Summoning Spells, Illusion Spells, Necromantic Spells, Transmutation Spells, Conjuration Spells, Divining Spells, Healing Spells, Enchantment, Plant Studies, and Pokegirl Studies. You may pay 100 cp to have passed the Master’s test for additional courses. For an additional 300 cp you have passed all of the tests. "
159,,1000CP,Technomagical Genius | All Magic Affinity ,In Another World With My Smartphone,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Technomagical Genius (600CP) You are a master of both magic and technology, as well as fusing them together. Your only equal in the history of the world would be the famous Regina Babylon, the genius professor that created the flying islands of Babylon (named after herself) as well as the Frame Gears ... which are basically magi-technical giant mecha. You are her equal in these arts and crafts in every regard, your only limitation being access to resources and personal magical ability if you don't have All Magic Affinity. You can even make gynoids and transfer the consciousness of a person into said gynoid if you felt like it.
All Magic Affinity (400CP) Like what it implies, you have an Affinity with all types of magic, including all types of Null magic. This means that you have the (possibly unique) ability to use all types of magic in the world, needing only to know the chant needed to activate it and a general idea of what the magic is supposed to do. For example by knowing that the Gate spell requires the chant of gate and that it is a spell that opens a portal to a place you have already been you would be capable of casting that spell. You carry this ability to quickly learn and master all forms of magic to future worlds and systems."
160,,1000CP,Magic Knight,Erona,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Corvia’s famed defenders, the magic knights have kept Corvia safe for 700 years against all who would seek to do it harm. Now you too have joined their illustrious ranks and have the training to correspond with your status. First, you have trained your body to peak human fitness, with a sword and armor feeling light and physical exertion being easy. Second, you have gained the ability to wield the power of magic, giving you access to many useful abilities. 
Knight Prodigy (600 CP) Discount Human Requires Magic Knight): (Erona) You stand as an exemplar to what it means to be a Knight. Your magical resistance is so high that all but the most powerful spells or curses have little effect on you, and you can easily strike down beings as tough as orcs with a single sword stroke. Your magical ability is off the charts as well, easily learning a large variety of spells whether it be in healing, attack or just to enhance your already impressive physical capabilities."
161,,1100CP,Mantra Generation | Guide of Naraka | Demigod | Mantra Affinity | A Tangled Web Weaved | Mantra Training and Techniques | Cyborg Hindu Godbody ,Asura's Wrath,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Mantra Generation (0CP) A being with a soul (you do have a soul, right?) can generate Mantra by prayer or feeling emotion. This mantra can be utilized by devices powered by Mantra Technology, or the Demigods of Shinkoku Trastrium.
Guide of Naraka (100CP) You gain a secondary form that of a golden spider. You gain the ability to visit Naraka, the space between the living world and the engine of reincarnation, dangling from a single spool of divine spider silk. When inside Naraka, you may manipulate souls who are attempting to climb the infinite towers and return to their lives, rendering them your catspaws. Finally, when in this state your voice takes on an eerie intonation that subliminally influences a subject's emotional state. The spiderform also helps you think up armor piercing questions and baffling Koans.
You cannot spend more than 24 hours in Naraka. If you do, you must climb out as described in Tower of Naraka.
Demigod (100CP) You are one of the elite masters of Mantra, equivalent to the Eight Guardian Generals/Seven Divinities in power if not actual rank. You have access to the most extensive theotechonological advancements and training techniques. Mantra Levels: Your maximum Mantra Level is what you can safely wield before damaging yourself. If more Mantra is focused your way, you run the risk of exploding, or turning into a planet powered rage monster. Neither of these outcome are guaranteed, of course. Your Maximum Mantra Level begins at 0 before any perks.
Mantra Affinity (100CP) You are empowered by a single flavor of sentient emotion. When acting within the themes of your dominant Mantra, you are capable of peak human feats. You count as both a prayer source and an emotional source of Mantra. There are eight Mantra affinities, Wrath, Violence, Vanity, Sloth, Melancholy, Lust, Greed, and Pride. Without a Mantra Affinity, you are denied the strength of emotion, and must subsist on ordinary Mantra. By taking this perk, your safe Mantra Level is set to 2, and you always count as having a minimum of Mantral Level 1 for purposes of determining such feats.
A Tangled Web Weaved (200CP) You gain a true god's understanding of Mantra's fundamental nature. Strangely, it seems to resemble a spider's web, and you are able to manipulate it into a batch of silken threads. You may spin silk in your spider form, or from your hands. It can be anchored to air itself, and are made of glittering golden Mantra. The strands are nigh unbreakable save by superhuman effort. With skill, care and practice over centuries, perhaps it can be manipulated to more complex tasks than mere ensnarement...
Mantra Training and Techniques (200CP) You have learned or been taught numerous techniques to focus and express your Mantra, rendered as supernatural martial arts and superhuman feats of agility, durability and so on. Meditative Kata can extend your natural lifespan, heal minor wounds and fight off sickness, while strikes and attacks could shatter walls. This increases your maximum Mantra level by 1.
As an added benefit, this perk also allows you to create your own personal Mantra Form. Your first form will take approximately five years of study and meditation to fully construct, but when completed, you will be able to manifest an external mantra interface. To most people, it will look like an ornate halo, evocative of your personality and mantra affinity.
A Mantra Form usually has a core theme, such as improved combat ability, damage resistance, speed or other such boosts. Establishing a form enhances your abilities, even beyond what a given level of Mantra would normally allow. With a mantra form active, you may easily perform superhuman physical, mental and social feats, even before the direct application of Mantra. These stances and techniques however cannot enhance stranger powers such as psychic blasts or arcane magic, short of ensuring you can survive to perform them.
Successfully creating an initial form and manifesting it increases your capacity for Mantra by 1.
Subsequent forms and other perks can increase this cap further, to a maximum of 8. You may use any mantra form you know, but you cannot stack them. Creating a new form takes ten years, times the number of forms you have already mastered.
Your halos can be attacked however, and if knocked aside or even destroyed. If that happens, you immediately drop down to Mantra Level 3, and any excess Mantra is wasted.
Cyborg Hindu Godbody (400CP) You have a genetically, cybernetically and magically enhanced physiology, and the knowledge to propagate this technology. Your capacity to wield Mantra is enhanced, both accepting general Mantra as well as your primary association.
This constructed body can heal itself, or be repaired by yourself or others. Your magical physiology is obvious, but always aesthetically pleasing. You can survive in space without a suit, endure planet busting attacks with sufficient Mantra, and are otherwise ageless. This increases your maximum Mantra Level by 2."
162,,1200CP,Facets of Sockets | Chromafactor ,Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Facets of Sockets (600CP) Gems are both a way of effecting the world and a stable source of power, but they don't actually do anything unless directed. Sockets are the mounting points for gems, and they define how the gem's power is expressed in the world. They don't provide any power, but they provide a path for existing power to flow along in order to achieve specific results. This perk makes you an expert at the types of sockets in the gemcraft world, and also allows you to come up with novel designs in the future. All gemcrafters know how to create Towers, Gem-Traps, Lanterns, Amplifiers, and Pylons, but you can make more efficient versions of them that syphon off some of a gem's spare power to reinforce themselves. Oh, and we'll even toss in Magical Walls for free. Be aware that these structures are made of solidified mana and thus the more of them you have linked to your Orb of Presence (or around your personal fortress) the more building a new one will cost.
Chromafactor (600CP) Different wizards use different colors of gems to enact different effects. This perk allows you to create new gem colors based on any magic that you understand at a fundamental level. The gems can then be used as inflexible but incredibly potent foci for those effects. If a normal sleep spell could cause a strong foe to become drowsy, the applications of a gem that can send entire armies into eternal slumber are hopefully obvious. This also acts as a capstone booster, providing additional benefits from each origin's capstone perk"
163,,1300CP,Magical Arts ,Kuroinu,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Magic is a rather rare talent, possessed by only a few noticeable people such as the Black Queen Olga, the priestess Kaguya, Volt’s henchmen Keanne and of course yourself. 
Those with Kuroinu alignment gain access to Keanne’s particular brand of skills. Whether it be creating magic sealing collars, an elixir that makes a woman's mouth incredibly sensitive, modifying monsters/humans to greater (sexual) heights, or even creating a spell that allows you to command those under its power to follow your exact commands, emphasis on exact. Your powers aren’t just sexual either as you also can create a powerful barrier that greatly weaken a mage and disables their magic. 
Those with the Seven Shields Alliance on the other hand will find a much more noble form of magic. Empowering your allies to stand strong and match the beastmen and orcs in strength while standing up to juggernauts such as the ogres with much greater strength. You can also heal their wounds, at low power allowing those affected to recover from minor wounds much faster from battle damage, and at max power regenerating even lost limbs in seconds, although such powerful healing magic would take a lot out of you. 
Or rejecting both you could always gain powerful dark magic instead, while you are no Queen Olga, you would still have noticeable skill. Dark magic includes things such as raising the dead to act as minions, directly lashing out at foes with your magical power and Queen Olga was able to make the lands around her Black Citadel inhospitable to all but the most stalwart of creatures to deter and weaken her enemies. 
If you happened to buy Voice of God then in addition to your chosen magic you also have learned Kaguya’s ability to craft magical talismans. While these magical creations don’t pack the punch that someone like Olga would have as a mage they still can be used to weaken or even kill those hit with them and you can even give them out to your followers for them to use in a pinch. If you are ever desperate you could always craft a talisman placed on your own body that kills anyone who has sex with you, but a strong enough constitution such as an ogre can always...pierce that protection. 
Voice of God (400 CP Discount Seven Shields Alliance): Perhaps you lead another band of religious warriors similar to Kaguya, are a high ranking member of the church around Celestine, or are simply just some random cult leader that is aligned with the Seven Shield’s Alliance. No matter the case you hold great sway over the religious. The power of this perk is three fold. First you seem to exclude a voice that speaks with god’s Authority and if the god you worship actually exists then you have the ability to speak with them directly or at the very least know what they wish for you to do in a situation. As an added bonus you also seem to have gained the Priestess's God’s ability to communicate with workshippers. Whether God is an actually divinity or just a mage pretending to be one like Shamhaza claims, his power could still serve you well if you ever wanted to found a religion of your own or wanted to inspire those that follow you. "
164,,1500CP,Keeper: Forger of Giants: Enchanted ,Azeroth,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Forger of Giants: Your talents of craft extend to the direct creation and modification of living beings. You have the ability to craft life itself. While you cannot make life from nothing, you can harness any source of life or spirit to create a soul for a living being. Without a source you may still make complicated facsimiles of life similar to A.I. and or elementals. You may forge, re-forge, temper, purify, and heal any kind of mind, spirit, body, or soul cleaning it of corruption, deterioration, disease, tarnish, blemish or error, strengthening it against harm or others interference. While you do have the ability to do the same to even yourself, it will take a great deal of time or power, as you were crafted by the titans themselves and already tempered to such an extent to be able to wage war against the corrupting and chaotic forces of the old gods and elementals. Your ability to craft and uplift bodies and souls allows you to create races up to a similar power and form as the Mogu, Tol'vir, Iron Vrykul, Earthen, and Giants. You have the ability to resurrect any being weaker than yourself into its original body or into a new body up to a form you could create, as long as a beings, mind, spirit, soul hasn't been captured or restrained you can resurrect it freely, even if its essence is being restrained. You have the ability to transition between the realms of the living and the dead, attack incorporeal beings with physical matter and even if a soul is destroyed as long as you can find even a fragment of it or the being that destroyed it you can use the fragment or shatter the destroyers soul to re-forge the original soul, you may need a source of life or spirit to rebuild it as if creating a new soul from scratch.
You May Choose: Priest
Enhanced: Given the same amount of time and effort you could create beings on par with the titanic-watchers themselves, elevate the proto-dragons into full dragons, or raise the dead as Val'kyr. But now given enough time those are not limitations to what you can create, given enough time to forge and craft you could create a being to rival anything, old god, naaru, dragon aspect there is no limit as long as you have the time to forge strengthen and imbue more energy or craft with better materials. The stronger and more skilled you grow the faster this process becomes. The life you create can be given extraordinary abilities to travel between the realms of the living and dead or the dream interacting with such realms with ease. You could craft intangible or incorporeal bodies, or forms made of living lighting. Even without access to spirit you could craft a soul from any of the primal forces creating an arcane soul or a soul of light, while they fundamentally work differently and some scholars may argue with you it is life. Anything you craft will be unfalteringly loyal to you, obeying any order or command you have never trying to betray you. While this is happily and willingly desired by things you create from scratch or imbue with its first wil., the resurrected may only be begrudgingly held to this standard. This specialty applies to anything you can create not just life. No sword you forged could ever harm you unless you wanted it to and if it was a living weapon it may even slice it own wielders throat if they tried to use it against you. You may put limitations on wielders like Odin did with Mjolnir. You are now a font of Light, you may wield and imbue light into all your magic and crafts, while not infinite or even at the level of a Na'ru the light in you will continue to grow and will eventually allow for true light forging.
You May Choose: Paladin"
165,,1500CP,Keeper: Shaper of Worlds: Enchanted ,Azeroth,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Shaper of Worlds: Your skills in the crafting of objects, buildings, and landscapes grants you the ability to forge artifacts and legendary equipment with ease, your crafting capabilities being an order of magnitude greater than they would have been without this focus. You have the ability to craft landscapes, you can easily shape mountains, valleys, rivers and seas to your liking in minutes enriching the earth and sky with magic to amplify and encourage or discourage the flourishing of life or specific species. Everything you build is a masterful work of art, both beautiful and functional beyond compare. The things you create being sturdier and nearly indestructible fighting off the weathering of time and the environment even without the use of magic, a painting you made could be lost in an acid swamp for millennia and barely need a light dusting and drying to make it presentable. You also have an intuitive sense of any crafts you come across instinctively knowing what it once was no matter how rundown it is, even a small shred of a few strands of a quilt would do, having visions of and knowing its full purpose, intent, and how it was used; you have the ability to understand the original creators design and how to improve it both functionally and artistically. Anything you restore qualifies as being crafted by you for the purposes of any effects you have, including your preservation skills and quality skills. Anything you are actively crafting, have crafted, or in charge of can be preserved by your will and an occasional thought, this being an active force protected against harm, decay and entropy. Only beings who directly intend to harm you or the things you have crafted or preserved can hope to damage them and even still such damage is lessened, and you will be able to restore such things later. You may repair and restore things to exactly as they were or an improved state up to your level of crafting; your powers of preservation and restoration can apply to non-crafted things that you watch over such as the environment, climate, weather, and enchantments.
You May Choose: Hunter
Enhanced: You may now craft impossibilities into your lands, cut a mountain or raise a continent into the sky where it will stay, imbue the land with the ability to fight back and defend itself against invaders, build world machines and city forges to aid in the creation of anything you can imagine. Your crafts are as immortal and timeless as yourself, nearly impervious to outside forces. You can build temples to enhance the gather of worship and various types of energy, forge and craft mega structures like sky elevators and dyson spheres, even artificial suns and black holes are within your grasp as long as you have the materials and magics. The prisons you build could trap old gods, multidimensional beings, eldrazi, or the like forever this extends to the point of beings that aren't just stronger than you but god like in their strength to you. You could build a tomb to imprison Sargeras till the end of time long after the heat death of the universe and your prison will still stand. Whatever you build will function as intended no matter how impractical the design is. This comes with the added ability of being able to force higher dimensional beings or entities from other realms into whatever realm you are crafting in. That ghost who can phase through solid objects can't phase through your bricks, or fist, unless you allow it. This comes with more esoteric capabilities like building rivers out of fire, mountains out of smoke, a living tree out of feathers and glass that is still capable of photosynthesis. Your alchemical capabilities are to the point you can not only transmute metals to stone, or vise versa, you could transmute things into organic materials of your liking or something between organic, inorganic, energy, and dreams. You are now a font, well, and battery of Arcane. Short of the titans themselves you are the strongest source of arcane energy. Arcane energy flows from you with ease allowing you to supply this power to whatever you like.

166,,1500CP,Keeper: Weaver of Dreams: Enchanted ,Azeroth,Domain: Skills: Magic,"The titanic-watchers, first of the titan-forged, their bodies were hand crafted by the Pantheon from the material surface of Azeroth before being brought to life by a great infusion of arcane and spirit. Designed to act as a medium between the Pantheon and Azeroth, flesh from one, mind and soul from the other. Traits - All titanic-watchers are immensely powerful beings, expert craftsmen, and masterful warriors wielding magics and skills for the purpose of destroying the old gods, taming the elementals, and ordering worlds from chaos. You must choose whether you are of the stone crafted Vanir or the metal crafted Aesir. The Vanir are titan-forged watchers fashioned from stone with command over the powers of the earth and fire. The Aesir are titan-forged watchers fashioned from metal with command over the powers of storms, wind, and lightning. While all titanic-watchers are already more skilled than even the greatest of mortals dare to dream, all titanic-watchers have specialties. You may choose Warrior or Mage as a class, and you choose one of the following specialties:
Weaver of Dreams: You have the ability to design new spells from scratch if need be, but you have an intrinsic understanding of all forms of magic or spells you come across. While you might not have enough power to actually wield those forces you will absolutely understand them. But what good is knowledge if you can't do anything with it? You laugh at such notions as you can always find a way to improve any magic, making any given spell, enchantment, or ritual more versatility, faster to cast, faster to recover, require less mana or resources, stronger, and increasing the duration; basically, any means by which a spell or enchantment could be improved is improved by double or half as appropriate. But you do not simply cast spells, you craft magic itself, from arcane sources, wielding forces beyond compare, making new spells, enchantments, and rituals as needed. Even on the fly, with comparative capabilities of other magics within that area, your improvisational magic is inspired and artistic in the extreme allowing you to incorporate any kinds of themes for your magics or supernatural abilities. As you are wielding the raw craft of the arcane itself, your spells cannot be countered unless the counter would negate magic itself (a counter fireball or counter any fire magic spell would not work against your fireball, they would have to have a counter for any magic spell, anti-magic effect.) Your magic is more resilient and more easily bypasses defenses, your enchantments take on a life of their own as you are able to weave enchantments into intrinsic natures to create wonders of spell craft such as true alchemy creating new substances, pocket dimensions, magical terrains and sacred places on the order of mythals, legendary spells, and magical items akin to artifacts, and mythical charms. Your magical strength and reserves are increased by an order of magnitude , and this specialty implies to any kinds of magic or similar supernatural abilities you have such as divinity or psionics.
You May Choose: Druid
Enhanced: You can weave magic into intricate reality so as to define the laws and natures of the world it's in and create spaces, realms, and dimensions that overlap with each other. With enough arcane energy magic can even be used to create realities and dreams that are interchangeable making something real into a dream or something that was once a dream into real thereby granting you the ability to craft matter and dreams themselves. Creating something like the Emerald Dream, for the dreams of life and world, or even the shadowlands, for the souls of the dead, would be easy for someone like you, if not time consuming, It took Freya a few thousand years to complete the emerald dream, which still required regular maintenance, preservation, and protection. Not only are you able to create new realms, you can freely travel worlds and sub-planes such as the old planes of the dream or the emerald nightmare. You can build gates to other worlds and planes or simply travel there directly, you can enter the spaces between spaces or even make them yourself. You have an intrinsic understanding of your place in the world and where to find things, lost or known, physical, ephemeral, or even knowledge. You are never lost, can easily find your way home or through any maze or labyrinth uncover all its secrets like child's play. And if someone ever does try to trap or endanger you you may simply step back into one of the realms you've made from anywhere. You have also become a font, or well, and battery of Life and spirit able to wield not only arcane magics, but druidic and shamanic ones as well, imbuing it into your craft. Your spirit energy and life force will continue to grow, which can be enhanced by proper usage of your realms and enchantments.
You May Choose: Shaman
While your abilities and skills are far more vast, varied, and greater than any other races, besides your makers, your power is not. You are stronger than any normal dragon, but the dragon aspects outclass you, it would take dozens of you to kill an elemental lord, and a small army of you may not succeed in defeating an old god let alone killing one. However, for an additional 500 cp you will be a Keeper, personally chosen out of the army of titanic-watchers, imbued with strength beyond compare. Your power is so great that many of the lesser races worship you as a god. Two Keepers working together could kill an elemental lord with relative ease, and a keeper with a small squadron of titanic-watchers could defeat and capture an old god. You may choose one of the following: You gain a second specialization blending them so that both specialization's traits apply to all aspects of the other specialization , or you may gain an unmatched level of combat experience removing the restrictions on your class - any class or profession you gain you become the paragon of that class outmatching anyone with that same class as you to the point of being able to hit one level above your weight/power class with ease you can pick one extra class for free. Either way the strength of all your specializations are doubled and you gain Enhanced capabilities with them. You will be a leader and a tactician capable of organizing thousands upon thousands of people with ease to accomplish specific goals such as war, combating poverty, or finding a cure for a disease. People will be more likely to help you than not, even if they have nothing in particular to gain. Any companions, followers, friends, organizations, and family you had before find their loyalty towards you increased. Things that are a direct benefit to you are guaranteed to have any organizations you control work their hardest to see you succeed."
167,,1700CP,Winger Energy ,Winger’s World,Domain: Skills: Magic,"Winger energy can be found in the milk, semen and vaginal fluids of the person generating it. Which, by the way, you now do. This gives several benefits, besides being a living battery. Most noticable is the growth. The more winger energy you have, the more your body will grow to accommodate. The more energy a person contains, the hornier they get. Usually in the breasts, testicles and cock. Note this growth isn’t permanent and shrinkage will occur as the energy is drained. Which can be done by draining the fluids. More energy is generated over time. By filling a person with a large amount of your fluids, you can jumpstart their own production of Winger energy. If you do the same to an animal, they will transform into a furry/anthro. Note that you can choose not to infect them with winger energy. You can also absorb energy from winger tainted fluids. Note that the energy transferred/absorbed is around 1 out of 10 used. This perk is free while in jump, but you must pay 100 cp to keep after. 
For 400 CP, not only can you infuse someone with Winger energy, but you can pass on your origin from this jump, as well as the 100 CP perk from that origin. As well, your energy transfer/absorption ratio becomes 1/5. 
For 600 CP, you can not only do the 400 CP abilities, but you can pass on any other biological perks you have. At first, they will be 1/100th of the power you have. But the more you stuff them with your cum, the close the perk will become to its original power. As well, your energy transfer/absorption ratio becomes ½ ◦ Unlimited power (600 CP): Congratulations. You have no limit to how much Winger Energy your body can store. You will never have to worry about becoming a level 5 or 6, with sexual organs too big to move. How is this even possible? This should not be physically possible. You are not physically possible! "
