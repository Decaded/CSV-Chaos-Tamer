0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,100CP,Creative Leaps ,Lords Of The Night - Liches,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You might not be as good at putting in the work, or checking all the steps, or keeping up with the research. What you can do, is make wild leaps that are consistent with what you know, jump to simpler solutions, and causally realize more elegant approaches to what seems like complex problems. A smarter mind than yours might figure out what actually has to happen to solve a problem. But seeing that solution, you can jump to how to do the same thing in a tenth as many steps, as you figure out how one action can solve two problems, and set you up to cleanly execute the next step. And your solution will be more robust to boot. You're also more intuitive, able to pick up and realize things without ever knowing why you picked them up or realized them, and more creative in general."
2,,100CP,Efficient Electricity ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Energy. Computers, being devices able to calculate AI paths while simultaneously rendering graphics for players to see, use a decent amount of it. Thankfully, you seem to be extra skilled in the area of computer electronics, able to make devices that not only use smaller amounts of energy for the same work, but are also more resilient than the average gaming device, able to handle electrical surges far better than most."
3,,100CP,REMODELLING ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Why be satisfied with just what you were born with when you can make improvements? Through a variety of methods of experimentation, you are able to directly improve the power and efficiency of living beings or inanimate objects by remodelling them. This can be as simple as making an animal not afraid of powerful people or as complex as turning someone into a powerful cyborg or bringing out latent Abnormal or Minus powers within your own brain, given you can use Remodelling on yourself just as easily. There's not much of a limit on how much you can improve someone but it will take more and more resources the crazier and stronger the changes you are making are.
* Keep in mind the crazy and strong changes are comparative to a world with reality warping conceptual powers galore"
4,,100CP,Savant ,Family Matters,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"There is some area of endeavor in which you are truly brilliant. This could be Waldo's talent for cooking, a particular sport, music, or any other real world skillset. You have the talent to be among the very best in the world, if you put in the work, and will achieve that status in far less time than most. This perk can be purchased multiple times"
5,,100CP,Spanner Hand ,Revelation Space,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You're very good at fixing things...and, it has to be said, breaking them as well. You've a keen eye for the right places on a machine to do some damage; load-bearing supports, sensor clusters, stress bands in the hull. But the reverse still holds: when it comes to up-armoring something, reinforcing it, and ironing out any weaknesses, you'll find the optimal placement for those, too."
6,,100CP,Technical Expertise ,Iji,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You're pretty damn impressive when it comes to all sorts of technical applications. With this, you can better modify your own weaponry, armor and augmentations. Or just be creative and accomplish tasks like rigging an elevator to catapult it's occupants into the ceiling, turning them into paste. Fun."
7,,100CP,The Right Tools ,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"They can be hard to find, but when resources are hoarded and hard to come by you've learned to make do. You can easily improvise for tools and materials you lack by creatively using what you do have, even if that means using scrap to build the tools to build the tools you need. Even if you're lucky enough to have a fully stocked workshop or lab this will come in handy, as you'll be able to do a great deal more with what you have instead of needing to commission or build specialized equipment for every unique little thing. You'll never be empty handed and useless for long."
8,,200CP,Artist's Eye ,Inception,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You've always had a keen attention to detail, but it's about more than just sight. Smells, sounds, if anything the dreams are defined by how they feel. Your skill at paying attention to the minutiae of your environment not only allow you to craft more intricate dreamlands for others to enter, it also lets you spot the details that truly matter. To some, an elevator is just a means to get from one floor to the next, even in the dream. For you? You might realize just what each of those floors represents, and how important it is that you know just what lies within someone's subconscious..."
9,,200CP,Educated guess ,Factorio,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Your subconscious mind works overtime to sort and fact-check everything you know, granting you a sort of poor man's precognition. In the field, your hunches are uncanny in their accuracy (but knowing false information can return wrong answers.) In the laboratory, this vastly speeds up your work as you quickly identify problems, test for the right thing the first time, and are directed to asking the right questions to find the best solutions. The more you know about a subject, the more this perk helps you."
10,,200CP,Excellent Craftsman ,In Another World With My Smartphone,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You are incredibly talented at making things. What kinds of things? All kinds of things. You are simply that talented after all. Anything you personally make, or direct the creation of, will automatically be top-quality, and you never need to worry about making mistakes in the creation process. To get you started you may pick any four mundane skills related to making things, which you start as a master of.
FREE: Magic - Affinity for two elemental magics along with null magic crafting (i.e. runes, enchanting, etc) "
11,,200CP,Facile Frivolity ,Rimworld,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You know just how to use excess resources. This may seem somewhat oxymoronic but whenever you possess a surplus of goods, be it food, medicine, or some crafting good, you will know exactly how best to put it to use. Maybe an extra half centimeter of plasteel insulation will make it so your lightbulbs never burn out! Progress!"
12,,200CP,Fixer Upper ,Dark Cloud 2,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"When they put you through an apprenticeship, the first thing they did was to tell you to take apart a train. Then put it back together again. Then they repeated the process, removing parts bit by bit, and yet every time you still managed to put the train back together. Eventually you've come to realize that you can repair things - all while removing any extraneous parts to ensure that the efficiency of a machine is optimized. Machines that you've tinkered with don't seem to need as much to work as others might."
13,,200CP,Heart of Fire ,Nexus 2.0,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Fire Elementals possess a form of magic called the Ember. This magic grants incredible resistance, bordering on immunity, to heat and flames, though it does nothing for the pain that heat can cause. However, that is merely a side effect. The true use of Ember is as a form of refinement, materials exposed to ember infused flame have their traits enhanced. Food becomes tastier and more nutritious, metals become more resilient, and potions last longer or have an increased effect. This does, however, require the material to be exposed to flame, so this will not work on certain materials."
14,,200CP,Innovator ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You'll never make a name for yourself if you can't innovate - and sometimes, innovation requires you to take risks and make mistakes, even ones which might be catastrophic. It takes effort to gain experience, and it takes courage to put in effort - but you've also got a bit of beginner's luck whenever you start trying to produce something new. You're far more likely to succeed - and consequently far less likely to fail if you go in completely blind, but more importantly than that, you're not likely to come up with a completely useless product in the end."
15,,200CP,Insightful Analysis ,Freefall,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Whenever you build, invent, scan, design, or perform a major repair on something, you have a clear and accurate understanding of it several decades in advance. The errors, issues, bugs, problems and so on that would be discovered with mass production and mass use of whatever item are clearly understood by you, alongside the fixes and preventative measures that would come into play."
16,,200CP,Master of the Forge ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You are a master at crafting everything from simple items to masterwork weapons. You need to devote considerable time to each individual item, but the resulting masterpiece will always be superior to a normal version of that item. You also know how to enchant your works with special enchantments, whether blessings that strengthen you in battle or curses that corrupt you."
17,,200CP,Nanocataylst Augmentation ,Crysis,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"The Nanosuit and it's successor was reverse-engineered from Ceph technology, and retained it's compatibility with their technology, beyond simple common protocols. It was also able to take in fragments of Ceph technology to decipher advances and take aboard specialized nanomaterials for its own use, making it stronger. This technique can also be applied to other types of equipment or symbiont, enabling them to take aboard fragments of other similar pieces of equipment to improve their capabilities. 'Similar' refers to technologies within the same general category. Rifles, Ceph Hardware, technology derived from a specific civilization and so on. Items may belong to multiple categories at once."
18,,200CP,Quick Seed ,Nexus 2.0,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Seeds are normally slow to grow, with more Light potentially cracking it open and wasting the effort. Sapphire goblins, however, have taken what many would consider a hazard and turned it into an art. Any Seed formed by a sapphire goblin is more stable, able to be pushed farther before it breaks open, allowing them to build them up faster. Additionally, in moments of need, a sapphire goblin can overload a Seed, holding it together just long enough to overpower it, before they let it break to use the Seed at a much higher power than normal."
19,,200CP,Robert the Builder ,Invincible,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You can seemingly build and organize anything with far less hassle and for greater results than most would experience. You are able to be the driving force behind projects large enough to affect entire countries or maybe even the world in its entirety. Somebody 'glassed' Las Vegas? Don't worry, you could lead a project to turn it into the world's largest and most efficient solar farm that can provide cheap electricity to Half of America. Some super villain messed with the tides the world over? You, with the help of some geniuses, would be able to successfully direct the building of a secondary artificial moon to set the tides to right. Truly, the sky itself isn't a limit."
20,,200CP,Well-Forged | Greek Body ,Assassin's Creed Odyssey,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Well-Forged (200CP) A misthios lives and dies by the quality of their weapons, and you have a particular edge in that department. All of your weapons and armor will remain in top condition with minimal maintenance, and you instinctively know how to take care of what little maintenance they do need. What's more, your weapons and armor will improve as you do. As you train and become stronger, your weapons will become that much sharper, your armor that much harder, without you needing to do anything beyond training or fighting. This effect can extend to non-violent tools as well.
Greek Body (0CP) You will need to be strong to survive in this world. Your body is close to the peak of human strength, strongly muscled and toned by a lifetime of training. You are especially skilled at the so-called “Leap of Faith”, allowing you to fall from great heights and roll to land with little to no injury"
21,,200CP,Wonder Forging Genius ,Generic Exalted,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Your crafting abilities need to be seen to be believed. From your hands pour forth miracles given form, works of art of peerless and breathtaking magnificence, works of culinary delight that would leave Emperors sullen at the thought that no other foods could compare, weapons that could last hundreds of years of constant use that would leave men feeling honored to have been slain by them, all these and more take shape under the guidance of your hands. You would be welcomed in any land and by any court for the sheer quality of your work, and you will quickly gain national, if not worldwide, fame for your creations if you bother to advertise them at all.
The least of your creations are superior to anything a mortal master might create, and even the simplest and least adorned of your works will be possessed of unmatched efficiency, resilience, and simple elegance.
Purchased with the Savant perk this is taken to an even grander height, leaving even the crafts of other Exalted looking as pale and shameful imitations by comparison, assuming you put forth the same effort they did in learning your base crafting abilities."
22,,300CP,Deity's Weapon | Weapon Synthesis ,Warriors Orochi,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Deity's Weapon (100CP) Naturally, your aura is not your only tool, and neither is it just for show. By imbuing a portion of your aura into a tool, you can turn it into a weapon capable of eating through physical and magical barriers alike. Naturally, as you're infusing a portion of your mystic nature into the tool, with time it will grow to possess magical qualities as well. With a sufficient amount of time passing, you could very well find yourself bearing a mystic weapon, one that has naturally absorbed enough mystic force to rival the greatest of magical weapons. With enough time, all that energy would be enough to make it a weapon of lore. Just don't expect it to happen anytime soon.
Weapon synthesis (200CP) Out there in the Dimensional World, you might not be able to find a blacksmith, in which case, it would probably be good to learn the skill yourself. Forging a spear or a sword? Well anybody can learn that from any blacksmith, here we're going to teach you how to perform weapon synthesis. Yes, it's not blacksmithing as you would expect. So, that weapon of yours. It looks completely serviceable, right? Battle worthy probably, probably killed off great swathes of foot soldiers? There's no need to sharpen it, but what about its inherent qualities? You know that magic enchantment on it? Or that spell it seems to cast every once in a while? Our form of blacksmithing works on those innate properties and spells instead. We don't strengthen the exterior; we strengthen what's inside, and bring the potential of that weapon up even higher. That low-level ice spell your sword casts? Yeah, let's work at it until it casts a stream of frost. It's going to take a while, but anything worth doing is going to take time. Better live with that fact."
23,,300CP,Do One Thing At A Time ,Dinotopia,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"When you focus yourself on doing a single task, your skill and efficiency doubles. Material requirements are unaffected, but time taken is halved and quality is doubled"
24,,300CP,Master Craftsman ,Forgotten Realms,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You are exceptionally skilled at crafting things. At your worst, your results are masterwork."
25,,300CP,Mechanic ,Ragnarok Online,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"While the Mastersmith socketed and improved items, the Mechanic instead focuses on machines namely the mado- gear that they are known for. Their proficiency allows them to improve machines the same way a blacksmith might improve a sword, and Mechanics with extensive experience can slot machines to accept external improvements."
26,,300CP,True Balance ,Earth Girls,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Despite how crude the raw materials seem, the finished weapons and tools of your work are perfectly suited for their job. A hammer you make of stone and wood is just as fine a tool as one you could make out of steel, and a stone spear cuts just as deeply as any you could make of carbon fiber and razor- honed alloy."
27,,400CP,Ancient Empowerment ,Generic Buffy Fanfiction,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"CAPSTONE BOOSTER. Just as the very first slayer was empowered with the essence of a demon, you too have been greatly empowered by an ancient essence. This empowerment comes with the obvious physical enhancement we see in slayers, as literally being a slayer is one way this perk may manifest, so it will come with the super strength, the durability, healing slightly quicker, general threat detection instincts, but that's hardly all you get. Your empowerment reflects your origin, drop ins and fighters get the aforementioned super strength, but sorcerers and engineers can trade this for magical power. You also get this whole Chosen One vibe going about you, such that ritual, magic, or mad science project that uses your blood is now twice as effective. Finally, by having this ""chosen one"" blood, your blood can be substituted for any blood seals meant for specific people. Your blood can open the Seal of Danzalthar even if you're not a vampire, your blood can substitute for lamb's blood in a plagues of Egypt type scenario, your blood can open (and shut) the gateway to Glory's Hell Dimension. This also extends to any item that's restricted by users or race, you can use anything you can get your hands on. You're just really special."
28,,400CP,Ambrosial Artificer ,Macross,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"So many moving parts, so many pieces to the puzzle. It's so... needless. The other tech teams are complete morons. That's why you've learned how to figure out the optimization of your complex machines like Veritechs. What parts you don't need, you find a way to do away with. What parts you DO need, you can use the now-extra space to improve and bolster their performance. Some will call you mad. But the only madness that will come from your work is the rage of your enemies and rivals."
29,,400CP,Behold Haxcalibur ,Modded Skyrim,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Congrats, you broke the crafting system. Anything and everything you make, build, enchant, or otherwise create is now ten times better than it really ought to be. Make an ordinary dagger that does 12 damage? Now it does 120. Pick up an endgame weapon and enhance it for its supposed max of 200 damage? 2000. Guns that hold more bullets and do more damage, magic staffs that massively amplify your magic, armor that shrugs off OHKO's, potions that let you ignore 110% of fire damage, weapons with ten or twenty enchantments. And if that wasn't enough, you'll learn anything crafting related ten times as fast, just to blow the competition out of the water even more."
30,,400CP,Cult Classic ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"It might not be the most popular game ever, but it still has one of the most loyal fan bases of all time. Every product you make has a chance of developing a cult following, with objectively better games having increased chances. Not all that useful, you say? Well, I forgot to mention that your fans will be incredibly susceptible to influence. Want them to attack a politician on social media? Done. Want them to help fund the next game in your series? Done. This is also a capstone booster, see notes below for details."
31,,400CP,Elemental Mastery ,Monster Hunter,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,Any elemental properties your weapon carries are significantly amplified by up to 50% depending on the quality of the weapon.
32,,400CP,Emotional Storms ,Exalted - The Infernals,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Most forms of precipitation and rain in the Demon City derive from the Yozi called Hegra, the Typhoon of Nightmares. She collects the constant fog of dreams that rises from Creation and condenses them into her clouds, to dispense them to the rest of the Demon City. Sometimes, she lashes the terrain beneath her with cold sweat from victims of night terrors. Sometimes, she sends erotic cloudbursts or blizzards of fancy. Anyone who touches her rain and snow, sleet and hail feels the emotions and perceives the visions of Creation's dreamers. So too, may you now infuse your works with emotion and dreams, that all who drink from your hand, all who look upon your works, all who read you writing, all who hear your voice and more besides are affected by the emotions you choose to infuse. Delirious passions, mad fear, and ever-changing visions are yours to grant to all you wish. Such is the strength of these moods and visions that you could drive mortals mad with them, if you are not careful. Though those of stronger make, like demons, will delight in them and revel in the exquisite experience."
33,,400CP,ENGINEERING ITERATION ,Sunrider,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"The highly analytical mind of a prototype can always see a way to improve something. Even with existing materials and techniques, there is always a slightly better way for you to manufacture a certain part or lubricate a joint. The improvements you make to your devices are noticeable and potentially endless, but you quickly find yourself at the mercy of diminishing returns. You can expect the first 50% worth of improvements to be reasonably attainable and up to 75% expensive, but beyond that it becomes prohibitively expensive."
34,,400CP,Evolve Each Day ,Green Worldz,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Every time your weapons are deployed in the field, you gain data. Data on what worked and what didn't, data you can use to make your weapons better. Even if you don't actually get a report from the user or recover the weapon from the field at all, you will still learn how and why the weapon failed, and how you can improve it to ensure such a thing never happens again. At least, not for the same reasons as last time."
35,,400CP,Green machine ,Factorio,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You have a knack for wringing every little bit of efficiency out of a system as possible. Your machines produce less pollution, consume less energy, and work just a little bit faster. On a larger scale, you know how to create a well-organized factory complex that makes efficient use of space, your conveyor system minimizes transport time and is free of bottlenecks, and you easily account for future expansion."
36,,400CP,Inspection and Rework ,Generic Factory,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Whenever you are assigned to deal with quality control, you find that most of the rejections are things that can easily be corrected and you never allow a truly defective product past your knowing gaze."
37,,400CP,Lathe of Heaven ,Chrono Trigger,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"We're always going to need weapons, so the way I see it, you might as well get good at making them. Now? You'll be able to give old man Melchior a run for his money. Swords, guns, armor, even sunglasses - if it's worn or wielded, you can make it a masterpiece. You'll also learn how to make use of any material, bringing out its best qualities and minimizing its weaknesses. You could make bone sharper than steel, gold sturdier than titanium, and take a legendary material nobody's ever seen before, and figure out how to forge it, what to alloy it with, and how to craft that alloy into an impossibly sharp sword or some amazing shades."
38,,400CP,Machine empathy ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Long exposure to strange energies and abstract thought inevitably leave their mark on a heretek. Usually these changes are debilitating or disfiguring, but you have only benefited from these alterations. A tiny glimmer of psychic power has awakened within you, one that will demand careful use and strict discipline to cultivate safely. As your power develops, machines will come to increasingly favor you, completing desired tasks without needing to be asked, performing faster and more efficiently. Machines in the hands of others will rebel when directed to harm you, guns jamming and sensors refusing to lock on. Many other ways to manipulate the mechanical will be revealed in due time, if you have the strength of will and ingenuity to discover them."
39,,400CP,Mechanical Master ,Borderlands,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You are a master armsmith and roboticist. You can build and maintain standard weapons and shields with ease, and if you put some effort into understanding it you could probably make E-Tech your bitch. Further, you can make temporary Digistruct items, though they tend to explode after brief use. If you find the right components, you might even be able to modify good stuff into truly unique weapons; some might call them Legendary. Though for some reason they always look kind of pearly.
* Has some other stuff but the main point is turning things legendary and them looking good"
40,,400CP,Metamor Stair ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Evolution is a wonderful process. It made these humans that are so fun to mess with, didn't it? But sometimes you can't be bothered waiting a few millions years for something to happen and just want it now. Now you can with just a touch, force anything, be it a person or an object, to evolve to a new and better stage up to twice. A monkey could be made to become a man and then into an evolved form of man. A blade could be turned into a chain sword and then into an energy sword."
41,,400CP,Modular Interplay ,Satisfactorio Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Anyone can just shove some snail slime in a tube and shove it into a machine to make it faster, but you can do so much more. You can create modules that can be installed into a machine to make it faster, more energy-efficient, more material-efficient, or some other such improvements. While these benefits do come with trade-offs, years of working with and designing and these modules will let you minimize and, much later, eliminate these downsides. If you don't take this perk, you will not get Factorio-style machine enhancement modules as part of your Satisfactorio Crafting perk."
42,,400CP,One Hit Wonder ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"For whatever reason, you have the ability to make some of the best games possible, using your skills to the fullest of their potential. Whatever game you make, and so long as you put in some effort, it will have a quality to it that makes it enjoyable for just about anyone to play, and if it gets big enough in the media and market it could easily be known as one of the best games of the year, and possibly even of all time. And despite the name, this isn't limited to a one-time thing. As a bonus, this is one of several capstone boosters that will boost any 600cp perks you have purchased to even further heights. Check the notes section below for details."
43,,400CP,Reforge ,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"The Goblin Tinkerer has a special process by which he can enhance various items, improving them in a wide variety of ways, a process which he charges dearly for. Now you know the secrets of that process as well, and can use it to reforge your various items, granting them a wide variety of properties. You can either sacrifice things of material value (I.E. money) or can dump mana into improving the object. The cost in either case depends on how well-made and powerful the item in question is, with better objects costing more to improve. However, one benefit is that your process is refined enough that you can push the reforging to either make the item better or worse, rather than relying on random chance. That said, it is possible for a highly improved object to simply eat the cost and then not change at all, so there is still a risk."
44,,400CP,Secret of Steel ,Historys Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"An illustrated guide created by the greatest master of weapons the world has ever known. It keenly details the techniques, methods and setup required to create weapons using traditional Japanese techniques. This text goes beyond that however, and if the directions are followed perfectly it can be used to forge weapons, armor, and tools that are far better than anything that could possibly be made even with the most advanced metallurgic technology. Objects created while still composed of steelwill be significantly stronger than steel and can withstand blows from a Martial Arts Master. Blades made using these techniques will be preternaturally sharp, able to cut through stone, steel and perhaps even more with proper strength and training. Such bladed weapons will almost never lose their edge and require virtually no maintenance. Armor made using these techniques is nearly indestructible and will never rust or corrode. Normal tools will work with such efficiency that even primitive tools can accomplish feats of scale equivalent to highly advanced modern technology. For example, a scythe made with these techniques could harvest an entire field in the same amount of time as a combine harvester or a simple hoe could do the work of a tractor towed plough.
* Does not only work on steel, it works on other metals too
* This is a low level cultivation setting, Martial Arts Masters can take on tank shells and missiles and destroy armored buildings in one sword swipe. So the new strength of items made with the help of this perk can be imagined."
45,,400CP,The Anything OS ,The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"This is a 'perfect' operating system for any computer. It's compatible with every form of software that exists, runs faster than anything that'll develop in the next hundred years or so, and has no weak points. In general this system is the greatest piece of software that can exist. Updates anytime there is software greater than it to be in the average top ten percentile of the local software. Never downgrades."
46,,400CP,Tim Taylor Technology ,Subnautica,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Power systems like nuclear reactors and solar plants produce double their normal output without straining the circuitry. Tools and habitat fixtures may be put into overdrive, increasing effect at the expense of efficiency. While in a vehicle, you may redline the engine, doubling its speed for sixty seconds. Overdrives and redlines drain power very quickly, and will damage components if overused."
47,,400CP,Touch of Improvement ,A 'Happy' Harry Potter fanfiction ,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Charity can sometimes be slow to change the world simply because it's impossible to help everyone without burning out, unless you have the means to affect multiple people at once that is. This is not that perk exactly but with it you can target important places and buildings to give them three types of improvement in utilities, atmosphere,and security. Utilities targets the things in that category from electrical wiring and plumbing to the appliances and furniture, Atmosphere focuses on how friendly the place is and whether people find it easier to relax or focus, Security takes care of all the protective stuff from enchantments and animated armor to metal detectors and locks. Three things can be improved in each category after which you'll have to make any changes yourself manually. Perk does not provide improvements in the form of people such as adding human guards for security."
48,,400CP,Triple A Title ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Even if your game is terrible, it still sells, and it sells well. Regardless of how bad one of your products is, it will still sell incredibly well as soon as it is made available to the market, even if reviews for it have denounced it for the garbage that it is. And should the product actually be good, it will maintain any hype that it had for several weeks longer than would normally be expected, and will continue to sell considerable amounts. This is also a capstone booster, see notes section for details."
49,,500CP,Diamond Techniques ,Summon Night Swordcraft Story,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Hoo baby, now you're cooking with gas! These are the same techniques used by Craftlord Rondeau, the Diamond Craftlord of Wystern! This means whatever you make is now in addition to being top of the line in performance, also top of the line in looks! If you have this perk as a Craftknight, you're likely to be a Craftlord yourself. If you're an Apprentice, you're likely to be considered the second coming of Craftlord Shintetsu just like Cleru or Pratty! This perk acts as a Capstone Booster for the Drop-In, Apprentice, and Craftknight Origins."
50,,600CP,A Gilded Bow ,Horizon Zero Dawn V0.9a ,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Be it a Lodge War Bow or a golden gun, the more invested the aesthetics of your weapon, the more efficient, accurate and deadly it becomes. What for others might be only usable as a trophy weapon is for you a weapon twofold as deadly as its undecorated cousins."
51,,600CP,A Mind of its Own ,SB Dragon Ball Z,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Obeying orders is one thing, but sometimes a situation may evolve past your orders, and you're no longer there to give new ones. With this, your creations gain a sort of sixth sense that alerts them to what you would like them to do in a given situation. Even when you're not anywhere near them, or dead, they'll still carry things out in a way that you'd most approve of. This also eliminates any issues where your creation will decide to do something for your own good. This isn't the only type of evolution that occurs however. As years pass they will become more efficient, stronger, and overall better. An android you build with the capability to fight a low level Saiyan could easily grow to challenge Vegeta within a few years. One that could fight Frieza may find itself reaching Majin Buu's level of power after half a century or so."
52,,600CP,Chosen of Death ,Lord of Light,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Great Yama, Death-god, has seen you clearly and bade you enter the Vasty Hall of Death, to serve as his partner in creation. Not merely revealing his secrets of science -you are his equal in the arts. Your creativity is that which may forge ten unique treasures each day, or mass produce legends. Design of all forms of weapons, armors, vehicles, and utilities comes to you with blinding light and strength of inspiration. With this position comes the virtual guarantee of rebirth in your next life, as a Demigod of the forge."
53,,600CP,Craftsman of the Gods ,Viking Saga,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Things you make yourself from base components gain properties far beyond what they should. Belts that increase strength several times over or a spear that never misses are well within your skill, and you will only get better."
54,,600CP,Legendary Master: Construction ,Rimworld,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,You're an expert architect capable of realizing truly magnificent and strange buildings. You know exactly how to balance the weight of any given structure to prevent collapse and can utilize even the weakest materials to support whole mountains. You are uniquely capable of reproducing or near reproducing almost any large-scale structure given appropriate resources. If you know how to produce something you innately understand how to build the facilities needed to manufacture/maintain it.
55,,600CP,Legendary Master: Crafting ,Rimworld,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You're an expert at the manufacture of goods of a truly staggering variety, whether its rolling joints, creating sci-fi tier ray-guns, or sewing a doll. The speed at which you create any of these implements is vastly increased and becomes shorter every time you successfully complete one. Every time you produce a copy of something you've already made it is slightly improved, a rough 1% increase in overall function. This stacks fully with successive fabrication though you must be personally involved in the process of creation. Roughly one in every 1000 of your creations will be Legendary, doubling all improvements from this perk and bearing a unique 'artwork' based on an event from your Jumps. Decided by myself, if you don't mind."
56,,600CP,Living Antibody ,Generic Cubicle,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"When you are working on a project, your mere involvement will cause errors, mistakes, bugs, flaws, or other issues with the project to be fixed almost automatically, with the errors correcting themselves and disappearing as you work on the project. Something as simple as tapping refresh over and over could be a viable way of actually fixing a program and any underlying issues it might have, with more dedicated efforts causing the errors to vanish that much quicker."
57,,600CP,Master Craftsman ,King Arthur,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Thanks to being taught by faeries, anything you make by hand is a great deal better than anything regular humans can make. Armor is nearly indestructible and lighter than it should be, blades are sharper, blunt weapons have more force behind them, bows and crossbows can shoot farther and are easier to pull back. Even mundane items like baskets work better, though you can't give items mystical powers without being a wizard or something."
58,,600CP,Mastersmith | Expert Smithing ,Ragnarok Online,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Mastersmith (200CP) The Mastersmith can socket items allowing him to add slots where modifications can be implemented onto items. While intended for cards, these can be used for other modifications which need slots if need be. (but effectiveness may be reduced)
Expert Smithing (400CP) It's not just about creating the sharpest blade anymore. Improved items now have affixes on them based on how many times they've been improved. Each level will be tougher than the next to improve and require more energy/mana/souls, but the Blacksmith's smithing ability now has no cap."
59,,600CP,Material Synthesis Science | Exotic Compatibility ,Gundam - After Colony,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Material Synthesis Science (200CP) You know a few things about getting your own materials, but you also have a bit of know-how about how the people here get such quality materials. Normally, you know how to forge, quench and mold materials into more high quality specimens, but you have a specialization in Zero-Gravity Material Synthesis as well-in microgravity conditions, you can create much more effective materials thanks to the limitations of gravity being removed.
Exotic Compatibility (400CP) You have a way of working with quirky and strange materials-in your hands and machinery, it assumes the forging and abilities of plain Iron until you begin building with it. You also can integrate exotic materials into your constructions a lot easier, and if you don't know what a material is or what it can do, you're very good at researching applications and properties of said materials. This research could also go into things such as improving production numbers and similar."
60,,600CP,One Bajillion Science Packs ,Satisfactorio Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You can use the research system from here to research small, incremental, quantitative improvements to one characteristic of a class of equipment, machine, or device, like +5% shooting speed for laser weapons, +2.5% top speed for ground craft, or +2% mining productivity. If something would benefit in the same way from two different types of boosts, only the greatest boost matters. (For example, with +35% handheld weapon shooting speed and +15% bullet shooting speed, the boost is 35%.)
You may share the benefits with your Companions and Followers. All users of this Perk on the same chain share the same set of boosts that have been researched. This Perk can apply to anything the user designs, builds, or uses, and can be toggled or scaled down by the user. While this might not sound like much, you may research the same boost as many times as you wish. The benefit increases linearly, but the costs increase quadratically; the Nth level requires N2 times the amount of all types of research materials used for that particular boost.
If you take this, then every delivery (of an orbital probe, 500-meter truss, or quantum-grade accelerator magnet) you make using a Space Elevator or Rocket Silo will grant you the research materials needed for this type of research, with each item delivered granting you enough of these specialized materials for the first level of research. You will need other types of research materials as well, but these are of the kinds you have already unlocked and produced."
61,,600CP,OPTIMIZED ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Newer isn't always better, and ancient does not mean something isn't advanced. In high civilizational scales, the musty old tech used by Elder civs cannot necessarily be improved on by those of younger, more vibrant species and in around 40% of cases, the older forms of technology win out over the newfangled stuff. Your stuff is almost always in that 40%.
Unless something is specifically engineered to counter your own tech or an effect your tech produces, newer technology is likely to have holes that your older tech somehow gets through. Software designed to counter sentient viruses might let an old malware script you invented decades ago through; armor made to turn aside bullets and beam weapons might fail before the simple geometry of your knife blade...and should you slumber for a vast amount of time, the world you wake to will likely have forgotten what you are and what you are capable of, innocent to any of your devices that have been forgotten along with you."
62,,600CP,"Reduce, Reuse, Rearm ",Dota 2,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Again, and again, people assume science immediately yields results. That there is one final answer to be found, which magically brings about utopia. Many would disagree in what specific meaningless poetic way they prefer science as, but it is easy to see that the more one works the more results they may potentially attain. That's not to say dead ends don't exist, and that one can mindlessly bash their head against a wall until a new weapons design pops out.
Either way, your methodology has embodied the constant march of science on a philosophical and practical level. You switch yesterday's capacitor for tomorrow's, yesterday's explosives for tomorrow's, every single bit of information gained from field tests and routine maintenance near-instantly analyzed in order to devise a new upgrade, meager as it might be. So it is, that a gun designed and wielded by your hand will change from firing rounds heard long before they strike to punching through a dark sorcerer's inner sanctum and striking them down before the soldiers outside hear it in a year of daily use. Channels give way to water wheels give way to pumps and complex sets of tubes as one realizes the imperfections in a system and creates a better method. While these simple refinements are surprisingly unhelpful in regards to the mystical arts and physical practices, a constant level of technological enhancement is incredibly helpful, even for one who lacks eternity."
63,,600CP,Resistance Ignorance ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"In many ways mages are on top of the world power-wise. After all, someone can only get so good at swinging a sword or hammer before things sort of just stop getting better. Magic isn't limited like that, someone can go from throwing a fireball that engulfs a tree or two, to casting grand spells that can change the world or lay the groundwork for apotheosis. However, there is one primary issue with magic as a whole, and it can be summed up in two words: magic resistance. The power to rip someone's soul out is only good if it works, and it'd be quite unfortunate for you to attempt something of that nature, only to have some meathead barbarian bash your skull in with an axe because of some amulet or innate resistance. Now that's no longer a problem. An absolute resistance to magic is now nothing before you. Your spells and magical items do damage like they weren't even there to begin with, and that's if they had a full immunity. For those unfortunate enough to have less than full immunities, or none at all, they'll see your offensive magic becoming that much more effective against them.
* Bypass magic resistance with your items"
64,,600CP,Rubedo ,Lords Of The Night - Zombies,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"You can imbue your craft with perpetuity. For gross structure, you can form a half-real substance from Corpus and Gold that, when invested in an object, perfects and transcends that object. Afterwords, you're left with the perfected shadow of the transcended object. Such shadows resist damage much like lesser artifacts, and if they are somehow damaged will restore themselves over time. The shadow is also just better then the original untransended object was. It costs roughly five parts gold for every one part of the object to be transcended. For engines and other systems that need to be fuelled, it starts out costing as if to pay to transcend enough fuel for it to run all day to create a perpetual engine that runs on a common fuel. There is no good benchmark for all the different exotic fuels you might have, but it's safe to say that it grows exponentially more expensive the more exotic the fuel."
65,,600CP,Self-Made Shopkeeper ,Recettear,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"On the quest to stock your shop with truly unique wares, you've learned a skill to fuse items, on a level that no mere shopkeeper could manage by themselves. Anybody can sell a pineapple or a banana, but only you can sell a pinenana! Ok fine, it's actually not that simple. The Fusion spell taught to you works well on items which have the same inherent properties, in the case of two fruits, or two swords, and so forth. Shopkeepers can rejoice that the value of the final product is the additive sum of both ingredients, but only one item can serve as a base, while the other item is consumed. That pineapple that I used as a base for demonstration... well now it can be peeled like a banana. That's handy, right? For any item that this is applied to, it will retain a single trait from the sacrificed item. It's almost as if you were breeding items. On second thought that probably isn't the best comparison to be making."
66,,600CP,Transhuman Protocols ,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"The things we could do if only every advance wasn't riddled with unseen dangers and hidden consequences. If they're smart they'll listen to you. You can take any technology or procedure that you understand and easily figure out the flaws, pitfalls, drawbacks, and unintended or negative consequences, and as long as you put in the time you'll figure out how to get past them. Whether it's ensuring cybernetic augments don't result in lethal rejection from the body, a gene-modification doesn't make the body eat itself from the inside out with cancer, or that a device to transfer a mind leaves the same person that went in and not just a copy, or just working out the kinks in something you'll find a way. The future is an uphill battle, and there won't be time to make it if you spend it stumbling."
67,,700CP,Minor Blessings | Unnatural Skill/Divine Child ,Percy Jackson,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Minor blessings (100CP) For one reason or another you've got a god who cares slightly about you and has seen fit to grant you some minor boon within their domains. Choose one god from any pantheon and gain a minor boon from them. The god will care slightly about you but unless you go on to further distinguish yourself it will be more of a minor interest in your affairs than someone they feel the need to help (Effectively think a diminished version of one ability a demigod might have, think minor ones are stuff along the lines of breathing water, lucid dreaming, or appropriate vague extra senses, useful but nothing especially major). This can be taken multiple times.
Unnatural Skill (200CP) Whether from your heritage or just being that good you've got one particular mundane skill that your feats which border on supernatural. Whether you're a smith on the level of the Cyclopes, a near prescient tactician or a swordsman who is nigh unstoppable with a blade your feats will be legendary. You are on a level within your skill such that only other beings of legend can hope to match you. This may be taken multiple times. You may not choose magic but you may choose a particular application of magic if you have it already (so curses, enchanting might work, more specific gets a bigger boost).
Divine Child (400CP) You are the direct child of a god of your associated pantheon and gain various benefits from this. You gain lesser manifestations of your parent's domains as well as generally being better than an ordinary mortal. You may take most any god as your parent but to take one of the heads of a pantheon as a parent you must take the ""Fate finds you interesting"" drawback receiving no points for it (you can also do this with a lesser god to get greater powers). Generally this will give you insight into and some control over your divine parent's domains, a son of Poseidon for example can control water and ships, talk to horses, cause minor earthquakes and is empowered within water."
68,,1000CP,Master of arms | Ancient Empowerment ,Generic Buffy Fanfiction,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Master of arms (600CP) Anything you can wield, can at will, channel your powers. Super strength make a gun's bullets shoot harder, super speed makes it shoot faster, and the bullets can be imbued with your magical energies. In the hands of a slayer, a wooden stake could punch through a robot's metal shell, though this isn't to say weapon quality doesn't matter, as a slayer with a metal axe would still hit considerably harder than one with a wooden stake. Furthermore, weapons become perfectly compatible with you; a holy sword could easily channel demonic power in your hands.
CAPSTONE BOOSTER: This now greatly enhances your relationship with all items, allowing fragments of your power, skill, and knowledge to remain in the item when you're done with it. The more effort you exert while using the item, the more of your essence is reflected in the item. The item will, in turn, begin boosting the powers it has absorbed whenever you wield them. If you loaned a weapon out to someone, they would find themselves having some of your powers, skills, and knowledge that pertained to that particular weapon. A hammer you used to build a house would make anyone wielding it more proficient in construction, and the pen you used to write down your biology notes would make someone better at biology.
Ancient Empowerment (400CP) CAPSTONE BOOSTER. Just as the very first slayer was empowered with the essence of a demon, you too have been greatly empowered by an ancient essence. This empowerment comes with the obvious physical enhancement we see in slayers, as literally being a slayer is one way this perk may manifest, so it will come with the super strength, the durability, healing slightly quicker, general threat detection instincts, but that's hardly all you get. Your empowerment reflects your origin, drop ins and fighters get the aforementioned super strength, but sorcerers and engineers can trade this for magical power. You also get this whole Chosen One vibe going about you, such that ritual, magic, or mad science project that uses your blood is now twice as effective. Finally, by having this ""chosen one"" blood, your blood can be substituted for any blood seals meant for specific people. Your blood can open the Seal of Danzalthar even if you're not a vampire, your blood can substitute for lamb's blood in a plagues of Egypt type scenario, your blood can open (and shut) the gateway to Glory's Hell Dimension. This also extends to any item that's restricted by users or race, you can use anything you can get your hands on. You're just really special."
69,,1100CP,Daedalus' Student | Titan's Blood ,God of War,Domain: Quality: Efficiency,"Daedalus Student (600CP) It is one thing to work on forging mere sword and shield, but it is another to create truly marvelous wonders... for a mortal. You could make marvelous wings out of bird feathers and beeswax, capable of granting flight to anyone. Or maybe you wish to create an everchanging Labyrinth, that shifts and alters itself depending on how it moves. Regardless, your architect and forging skills have taken a dramatic increase, to the point where the things you create just may have properties and quality they normally shouldn't have, albeit directed towards the purpose of your creations. Through your works, your will be known... but take care that the gods do not take offense with your work.
Titan's Blood (500CP) What a curious thing you are, to have become such a thing. One of your ancestors was a Titan, a primordial being of great power and ability that was responsible with shaping the world as it is. You are not full-blooded, but the effects have been prevalent on you nonetheless; your size may be increased up to fifteen meters in height, with your strength as such that you could throw pieces of buildings one-handed at your enemies. You may also choose one Titan you are a descendent from, gaining aesthetic appearance changes similar to them. But more importantly, you may relax yourself and 'commune' with the world and nature around you; by opening your mind to the world you can learn about it and its secrets quite quickly, along with finding what is the largest threat to the balance of nature. You are of the planet, child. It is your birthright to know these things.
 *Titan's Blood also grants access to the following boosts for capstones you've purchased:
* 'Daedalus' Student': Your crafting has undergone a dramatic improvement, to the point where you can make incredible works with the strength of an army within them. You have also gleamed into a new type of crafting, and you can forge energy constructs such as Zeus' Lightning to be used in your wishes."

These are the same techniques used by Craftlord Rondeau, the Diamond Craftlord of Wystern! This means whatever you make is now in addition to being top of the line in performance, also top of the line in looks! If you have this perk as a Craftknight, you're likely to be a Craftlord yourself. If you're an Apprentice, you're likely to be considered the second coming of Craftlord Shintetsu just like Cleru or Pratty! This perk acts as a Capstone Booster for the Drop-In, Apprentice, and Craftknight Origins.
Promise of Steel (600CP) ""The promise of a Craftknight is stronger than steel."" That's what is said about the dedication of Craftknights, and with this perk it isn't a metaphor. You now have the dedication and willpower to see through any promise sworn, either to yourself or another, although it's only in effect while you're working to make good on a sworn promise."
