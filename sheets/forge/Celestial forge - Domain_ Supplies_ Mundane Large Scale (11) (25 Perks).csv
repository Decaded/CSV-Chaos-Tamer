1,,100CP,Energy Crystal Generator,I have a mansion in the post apocalypse,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Energy crystals are the currency of the future,stonelike, hard crystals that are capable of holding gigantic
amounts of energy of any and all kinds. They're used to fuel tanks, computers, powersuits, everything.
And now you have a machine for making them!
Simply by feeding this machine energy through any of the many input methods it has, you can create
charged up crystals, holding that energy in convenient, packet-sized forms that are entirely safe to hold
and use, no matter the kind of energy. You can generate these crystals through hooking the machine up
to a power outlet, or you can use more... 'exotic' means.
After all, in the Post Apocalypse full of mutants, the most plentiful source of energy are the mutants
themselves. They're harvested for the energy crystals that develop on them, full ofthe radioactive
energies that serve in various ways to fuel the industries of this world. Similarly, you can chuck basically
anything into this device and if there's any kind of unique or exotic energy to be extracted from it,this
machine will do it swiftly and easily."
2,,100CP,Fuel Production Facility,Starsector v1.2,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"A large facility dedicated to the production of fuel. By default, the production facility is configured to
produce antimatter fuel, but this can be changed to produce alternative variants of fuel at higher
volumes. A single facility is capable of producing enough antimatter every month to supply around 10
capital-hull ships without a problem, or around 3000 units of fuel."
3,,100CP,Nullspace Computer,Megas XLR,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"You have a computer tower you can summon from and banish to nullspace. allowing you to upgrade it
but otherwise keep it safe. You may summon a holographic interface for it at will.
* Massive upgradable supercomputer that can be kept safe by existing outside reality and
simultaneously be used due to its holographic interface making it an extremely useful item which
benefits from all abilities which improve its performance while being entirely tamper proof."
4,,100CP,Provider chest,Factorio,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Whenever you open this space-bending chest, you'll find an assortment of the standard Factorio
resources, ready for processing. A variety of mundane wood and stone, pressed coal, iron and copper
ingots, uranium slugs in heavy lead containers, and barrels of oil and water. The chest stores about a
cubic meter of each material, and withdrawn resources replenish at different rates - you and your
companions will easily have enough water to live off of, a good-sized house could be built with a few
day's worth of stone and wood, while metals, particularly uranium, are replaced much more slowly."
5,,100CP,Resource Generator,Toaruverse,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Buying materials and resource cost too much time and manpower especially if the materials or resources
that you need are limited or rare. You gain a warehouse full of materials and resources no matter how
common to how rare it is that you need to build any technology that you want. It replenishes used
materials every twenty-four hours after you take it out the warehouse, additionally it records and
replenishes any materials that you add in your warehouse. After the jump it would become a warehouse
add-on or be inserted near your starting location.
* Gives a rapidly restocking warehouse which contains large amounts of anything that falls under
materials and resources that is stored in your warehouse improving most perks that are listed under
supplies."
6,,200CP,Basic CR-Units,Date a Live,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"The bread and butter of the combatants in AST and DEM. CR-Units are well, they look like a very fit onepiece
swimsuit, but they possess an energy shield that protects the user when active, as well as a variety
of deployable weapons and extra armor. The first purchase gives you the 'basic' model, used by the
grunts around. You can buy this again to get a personalized version, with upgraded stats and more
versatility and firepower, and even once again to obtain one suit on pair with the most powerful around."
7,,200CP,Body Shop,Smash Up,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"A good scientist pushing the bounds of human knowledge always has a use for raw materials. Here is a
collection of preserved body parts from every species in the world, updating in future Jumps. Just never
ask where it all comes from.
* Extremely useful for any biological projects or research but perk text is slightly concerning if you take it
seriously."
8,,200CP,Mineral Rights,Diabolical,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"You have, through some underhanded but fully legal means, acquired a metric ton of rights to various
mines and harvesting operations the world over. In practical terms this means you will have a sufficient
amount of raw metals, ores, minerals, and other physical resources to build or construct whatever you
desire all without paying a dime for it. You can also sell the excess on the open or black market, or simply
stockpile it all for yourself. This will follow you to other Jumps, providing a steady stream of physical
resources and allowing you to live the life of a mining magnate, or always have sufficient resources for
your industrial ambitions.
* A rare perk in the celestial forge in that it gives direct ownership of something outside the warehouse
that isn't a single building or a business."
9,,200CP,Mountain of Blocks,Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"To make a tomb, you need stone. Lots of it even. Even an army of skilled workers can't make a castle
from sand. The logistics of getting all the stones out aren't easy either, sometimes taking weeks of
planning and travel to arrive, with any number of things that can go wrong. You need not go through the
whole trial like this, since you never run out of stone, rock and other such things. You're able to bring out
endless amounts of mundane stone or rock and though they will need hewing and cutting, the amount
you save in money and time will be immense.
* this just give us a bunch of regular mundane stones nothing magical or exotic might be best to remove
this
* Potentially useful in the construction of celestial bodies as it is infinite and there is no restocking time."
10,,200CP,Vibration/Oscillation warhead,Arpeggio of Blue Steel,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Humanity's version of the Corrosive torpedo. Disintegrates the target at a molecular level by finding the
target's 'resonance frequency' and literally vibrating it apart. The Vibration torpedo can defeat any
armour made of normal matter nanomaterials or meter-thick steel, makes no difference, but can't punch
through Klein fields on its own. Superior to the corrosive torpedo, the Vibration warhead requires no
exotic matter or nanotech: it can be mass produced by any reasonably sophisticated factory. This is a full
load for your vessel, plus the schematics."
11,,300CP,Eufiber tumor,Trinity:Aberrant,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Don't show this to anyone unless you want to deal with some very awkward questions. Somehow you've
acquired a small piece of Anibal Buendia's tissue floating in a nutrient bath, or something very much like
it, that secretes strands of living Eufiber. You can use the Eufiber to make Quantum-Attuning suits. Living
Eufiber also interacts with other powers in strange ways it is known that cyberkinetic powers are
boosted when working with computers linked by a Living Eufiber network they are Attuned to. Finding
other uses for this material will require experimentation on your part."
12,,300CP,Store of Omni-Metals,DC - Larfleeze,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"A cargo ship carrying 40 million cubic feet of omnimetal, enough to build several buildings' worth. They
predate the current multiverse by a large margin, and are especially attuned to the nature of spatial
dimensions. Because of this they're extremely useful in technology involving warping space and bridging
between dimensions, making building such creations far easier than they would be otherwise. Your
supply is restocked at the beginning of each jump or 10 years.
* An absolutely massive cargo spaceship contains colossal amounts of restocking space and dimension
bending metals which predate the creation of one of the DC Multiverses."
13,,400CP,Crystal Garden,Azeroth,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"You now possess the very same crystals used by the Draenei in many of their creations. This single man
sized crystal, when planted, can create a massive mine filled with even more crystals of varying shapes,
sizes, and colors. The mine may be temporarily depleted if you harvest too much too quickly, but it will
regenerate more crystals for you to harvest if given a month to rest. The crystals you mine from this can
be planted into other areas to create new mines. However, these new mines will not regenerate after
use and once empties the land will need time to replenish the necessary nutrients before you can plant
more crystals. If you purchase The Mine then you will have an entire floor dedicated to these crystals
within your mine."
14,,400CP,Junkyard,Mass Effect Andromeda,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Junk to some is treasure to others. You get a doorway that leads to a small pocket universe that is filled
with the local area's lost, broken and/or discarded items. You might find broken gear, ruined vehicles, or
maybe a pristine limited edition item that someone just forgot about. Everything in here will be
somewhat useful to you, but you get to decide if it's use is as a source of resources, or if something is
worth fixing.The doorway takes the appearance of an expandable hula hoop that opens a portal to the
pocket universe.
The pocket universe will refill with junk as you travel, or as the local area around you generates junk that
will be siphoned off. In addition, if you haven't cleared out the junk universe in one jump, then you can
still pick it up in another, while the junk from the new jump will slowly filter in as space is opened up."
15,,400CP,Need More,Blade Runner 2049,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Replicants aren't exactly made from clay. The biological materials that go into them take facilities to
produce and can get rather expensive to make each and every one individually. You won't have that
supply issue however as you've got a seemingly endless supply of the raw biological materials needed to
make a Replicant. Or a human. Not too different in the end, you know? You'll receive enough to make at
least a dozen Replicants each day and it'll always refill the next day over."
16,,400CP,Sample Collection,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Oh, what's this now? Doing some experiments, are we? Well, if you are, these would be priceless. This is
a comprehensive collection of DNA samples, with blood, hair, nails and even bone samples from... well,
just about everyone who's anyone!
That's right. This is a collection of neatly labeled samples that have materials from very nearly every
powerful ninja, samurai, random guy, demon, sage... pretty much anyone who can be considered A-class
or above in the Bingo Book. The exact nature and quantity of the samples depends on the people in
question and their histories. That is, someone who keeps getting injured would likely have extensive
blood samples here, but for someone for whom it's a rarity you would likely see only stuff like hair and
skin, and quantities dependant on how easy it tends to ordinarily be to get those things from them.
The exception is for dead people, in which case you get significant quantities of everything from blood,
bone, skin... well, everything. Each and every sample is perfectly preserved, and experiments performed
on them have significantly higher chances of success than normal. In future jumps too, you get samples
from all major figures in the setting, whether in terms of fighting strength, intellect or the rest.
* Saves anybody interested in acquiring the genetics of significant characters from all the work and risk
involved.
* Unlike the Dragon Ball genetic sample item this includes unique individuals.
* Fiat backing improved odds of success in any experiment utilising them."
17,,400CP,Supply Cache,Batman Beyond,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Each purchase of this will grant you 1 of two large stores of replenishing resources that can be used for a
wide variety of projects. The first cache contains a large amount of mechanical and electronic parts that
can be used build or repair a wide array of weapons, gadgets, equipment, and cybernetics similar to
what Batman and his enemies use. The second cache is filled with an incredible amount of chemicals,
compounds and other substances that can be used to create things like biological mutagens, steroids,
drugs, and deadly toxins."
18,,600CP,Amber Ogia Farm,Ben 10,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"A fruit native to Revonnah that grow in the cracks found in boulders. Amber ogia can be turned into
clothes, fuel for ships and weapons, and even a meal that give your body everything it needs to survive.
This is just the tip of the amber ogia iceberg though, with the right knowledge and some work you could
find other amazing uses for it, such as creating a mind control potion. Despite all attempts to grow this
wondrous fruit on other planets, amber ogia always produces a poor and sickly crop unless grown on its
home world. Even artificially constructed farm planets fail. Luckily for you, you own a hectare of land on
Revonnah that's perfect for growing amber ogia. The best thing about this plot of land is even if you strip
the place completely clean of amber ogia vines, they will eventually start growing again anyway. Post-
Jump, your farm will automatically be connected to your warehouse."
19,,600CP,Atlesian Contacts,In the Kingdoms Service,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"An established group that will approach you if you are ever looking to start up a large enterprise. They
will offer advanced technology, very low-interest loans, expertise, and their own services to help you get
your enterprise up off the ground, and will support you until you are fully capable of standing on your
own two feet (so long as you are also putting in effort). Even beyond this, they will be a friendly
competitor so long as you remain on at least neutral terms. The level of help they will offer will adjust
based on the setting, but it will always be at least enough to turn a group of (skilled and informed)
teenagers into a major intelligence agency."
20,,600CP,Black Market,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"What, did you think it was all about cars? It's great as a hobby but you've got to make some money. To
do that, you've got some connections. Whether it's some secure communication channels or meeting
places, you've got your fingers in the criminal underworld of the universe. If you need to buy or sell
something off the table these are the guys you want to call. If there's some kind of commercially
available weapon, gadget, or vehicle of dubious legality you need to get and have its IDs removed, they
can do it for pretty reasonable prices. They're not so good at finding super rare or unique items, but just
about everything else is fair game. Just as well, if you need something to disappear or be sold, they'll
take it off your hands and you will never see it again for a pretty substantial amount of cash. Pretty
weirdly loyal for criminal underworld types too...as long as you don't sell them out or give them trouble,
they'll be happy to do business with you wherever, whenever."
21,,600CP,Box of Resources,Mass Effect Andromeda,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Have a box full of the Heleus cluster's resources! Great for all your crafting needs, and ensures that you
can always use your Andromeda gear. Omni-gel canisters, eezo, angaran meditation crystals, kett alloys,
remnant polymers, eiroch fluid sacs, remnant cores, renderable plates, scale fibers, shell filaments, soft
chitin.
You will have to find your own source of the non-exclusive minerals though. This box is as big as the
shipping container for the Nomad, is equally divided amongst the 11 resources, and will refill itself once
a week. Post Jump, instead of a single shipping container divided amongst the resources, you get a
shipping container of each resource, and they all refill monthly. In addition, anytime you run into a
universe specific material that you regularly use for crafting, another shipping container will be added.
You must have used that material for crafting purposes several times before it would count."
22,,600CP,Genetic Database,SB Dragonball Z,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Having a genetic database of all the known races in the universe might seem a bit overboard, but I'm
sure many would disagree with that notion. This item is just what it says on the can. You have both the
genetic sequences, and copious DNA samples from all the races within the Dragonball Universe. While
individual mutations or rare developments are excluded, you still have a lot to work with. The entire
database comes in the form of a knee high box with a terminal on it. Searching this terminal and
choosing something will cause it to open up revealing the samples/information. Everything inside
regenerates within a day."
23,,600CP,Cold Fusion Reactor,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"You have a cold fusion reactor. It contains an obscure and fantastical palladium alloy which allows it to
fuse hydrogen atoms without creating ionizing radiation somehow, creating fairly low-temperature
steam which can easily power a turbine. The reactor is so safe you could even make hot pot in it without
hurting anyone, though you will probably have a hard time convincing anyone to eat your food made in a
nuclear reactor."
24,,700CP,Recycler And Fabricator | Operator Dispenser,Prey,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"Recycler And Fabricator (400CP) Perhaps one of the most innovative technologies TranStar has
developed after Neuromods. Recyclers breakdown material into its constituent components, by default
these are ""Organic"", ""Mineral"", ""Synthetic"" and ""Exotic"", to be used in the fabricator. Providing that you
have a compatible schematic small enough to fit inside the fabricator and the correct materials, the
fabricator can craft complex items such as Q-Beams, turrets and Neuromods.
Operator Dispenser (300CP) An unlocked robot fabricator which can create one of 4 different types of
""operators"". Medical Operators heal the injured, Engineering Operators repair systems like your suit,
Science Operators replenish your Psi and Military ""Black Box"" Operators come equipped with offensive
lasers. Comes with 3 charges and will need 3 units of Synthetic, Mineral and Organic material to create a
new charge."
25,,2200CP,Chronos Supply,Katana Zero,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale,"This is a case of 10 Chronos syringes, there is nothing special about the syringes or the Chronos
contained within (aside from the usual), and the case replenishes at the end of every week. However, if
you want to pay a little extra, you can get a shipping container, containing about 1000 doses, that
replenish each week, and the formula to make Chronos. The third and final option nets you the same as
the second option, but without the side effects, this nets you a shipping container full of side effect less
Chronos and the recipe to make more. Taking this improved version of Chronos will purge a person of
their addiction, and can reverse some symptoms of withdrawal."
