1,,100CP,Mundane Supply World,The Celestial Foundry,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"This item gives you access to all the materials that one could get on Earth, but with one caveat, you'll
have to find and harvest them yourself. Your warehouse gains a portal that is linked to an artificial plane
of existence that is of infinite size in all directions, where humanity or sapience of any kind never
developed. You can find an unlimited number of any resources given enough time, but they are spread
around as would naturally occur in nature, meaning you have to often move when you exhaust the local
supply. Resources are always located in environments where you would find them on Earth, and when
you travel to this world, you are able to choose which environment you arrive in, or return to any prior
location you have been before. Environments have realistic distances between them, so if you need
something found in several biodomes you need to return to your warehouse, or use a fast transport of
some kind.
Every time you gain a perk that requires access to a new raw material, this raw material appears in the
most native form in this supply world and has to be collected as it normally would be. If your material is
only found inside stars, you better be ready to get a rocket to go collect it somehow."
2,,200CP,Cidhna Mine,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Nobody escapes Cidhna Mine, that's how the saying goes anyways. Cidhna mine is an extensive set of
tunnels snaking into Nirn which the Silver-Blood Family uses as a prison and as a source of much wealth.
Yours isn't that same dreaded mine, though it's similar in many ways. Placed in a reasonable location of
your choosing is a copy of the mine, while the original was predominately used for silver mining yours is
much greater. Throughout the mines are extensive reserves of just about all of the ores found in Skyrim
at the time, ranging from Ebony to Stalhrim and will produce an incredible amount. These reserves will
replenish themselves once they begin to run dry and the mine will be manned by NPC guards and
workers, though you could always appoint your own workers and guards if you wished. In future jumps it
updates to include new material in the mine.
* Gives unique skyrim materials"
3,,200CP,Guild Linked World Item,Overlord (The Series) Guild Base Supplement,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"The Great Tomb of Nazarick contains the Throne of Kings, a World Item (and the throne in the throne
room) that protects the entirety of the guild base against all attempts at scrying or anti-scrying attacks,
and that further generates a small amount of Yggdrasil gold coins any time someone within would be
subjected to such, alongside several other effects. Your guild base also possesses a World Item of similar
potency integrated into it, and you may purchase this option multiple times.
Maybe you possess the Rainbow Bridge, which forbids all hostile forms of spatial manipulation within
the guild base, while simultaneously providing unparalleled mobility to your own forces that pass
through it, allowing them to quickly appear across any distance and even breach dimensional borders,
and allowing them to quickly return once finished with whatever task they were set.
Perhaps instead your guild base contains within it the Garden of Eden, a place said to contain at least a
single copy of every plant (or plant like thing) in the entire world, and often many many times more than
that for more common things, regrowing within a day anything that is taken. To say nothing of the
mighty plant-based creatures that spawn from it that will help to defend your guild base, or how you
could harvest from it constantly to feed an immense population.
Or perhaps instead your guild base possesses an entrance to the legendary Agartha, a subterranean city
long abandoned but filled with such mineral wealth that it could be mined forever, with an ore vein for
every type of metal or precious stone one could imagine no matter how rare that replenish a mere day
after excavation.
If those don't tickle your interest, perhaps you will find the Scholomance to be to your liking? A school of
dark and forbidden magic, filled with the knowledge of every spell imaginable, and that allows
unparalleled control and manipulation of the weather and empowers the magic of all rightful inhabitants
of the Guild Base while they are inside.
Or maybe none of these things appeal, and you have a different idea in mind? So long as it is not one of
The Twenty (ie: expendable 1-time effects), and so long as it remains entirely tied to the Guild Base itself,
you may instead come up with your own World Item, with appropriate effects to apply to your base. In
such cases, fanwank as appropriate."
4,,200CP,Holy Stone,Everyone Else is a Returnee,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"This is stone infused with large quantities of holy energy, meaning it is extremely full of mana as well as
incredibly durable. It is in this way that the holy stone can then be used in any number of ways. Due to
the holy properties, it is particularly good for use in the equipment of priests or paladins. Similarly, due
to its natural strength it is good for the construction of buildings and structures. You receive several tons
of high tier holy stone, enough to make a small house. Any used stone is refilled each month."
5,,300CP,Field of Heart-Shaped Herbs,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Out of all the Wakandan secrets that lie within the borders of the reclusive city, this one is the most
potent secret of them all. It is also the most dangerous. It is a small but potent field, its soil infused with
radiation from the ancient Vibranium meteor when it fell to such an extent that it would affect any plant
life growing within it, like these herbs. The herbs are taken and ground up so that it may be imbibed, and
when the imbiber is buried under a light covering they will find themselves on a spiritual journey to talk
with their ancestors... and then rise a greater warrior. Strength and speed that reaches the lower levels
of superhuman, durability to survive explosions with minor injuries. Perfect coordination and balance
with agility that far outstrips Olympic athletes. It would not be too farfetched to say that the results of
this herb match even the ones derived from the Super Soldier formula that made Captain America... and
now you have a small field of these plants. Be very careful. After you leave, this can either be a property
or a Warehouse Attachment."
6,,400CP,Dust,The Games We Play,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Ah yes. Where would we be without this? This is a supply of Dust of all types, presented to you weekly
for whatever purposes you may have for it.
Dust being a crystallised form of elemental energy, color changing depending on what it's elemental
affinity is. It can be used for a variety of things, be it adding some Aura to make them explode into a
burst of their native energy or sewing it into clothing to make empowered wear, putting it in bullets to
create specialty ammunition of great strength or just to power technology. Types seen thus far are water,
air, lightning, fire, gravity, time and Light, but there are many other kinds.
For 100 CP it's a fairly small supply. More than enough for a family, even the most wasteful or
extravagant one or businessmen or Hunters or any other. Let's say several kilograms of each type.
For 200 CP it's a larger supply, many tons upon tons of it, enough to keep a small city functioning pretty
easily, or keep a small army supplied. Emphasis on the 'small', mind you.
Of course, you could pay 400CP instead and forget all these constraints. You now own a whole deposit of
dust, one with nigh-endless supplies of all types. But of course, once again, the keyword is 'nigh'. Or you
could have a set of literally bottomless containers, but where's the fun in that?"
7,,400CP,Gold Market,World Seed,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Welcome to the Gold Market! As this is your first time as a customer, let me take this moment to explain.
By going to any temple or altar to the Gods, offering one gold coin, and praying for the market to appear,
anyone can gain access to it. Though in your case, you'll simply need to think about it for the market to
appear in its entirety in your mind, and can browse it at your leisure without having to pay any fees.
From there, you can buy anything, as long as you can pay the price, though the price is inflated just a tad,
such as Seeds of Water normally costing 1 silver going for 20 instead, and something incredibly rare like a
Seed of Time costing half a million gold. Incredibly powerful items made by the Gods and normally only
accessible through completing quests might even be priced at billions of gold. But this cost is worth it, as
there really is literally anything available: items, hints on how to advance your abilities, skills and abilities
themselves in their entirety, NPCs (artificial entities created by the system) of any level, whether you
want to lease them or buy them outright, information, or animals and monsters. Even things of
questionable usefulness can be found here, such as the sex tapes of the Gods (""Goddess of Breasts VS.
Goddess of Beauty, Beach Edition, Interactive""), or the abilities to always sense the time of the day and
to guess how many hairs there are on a creature. And if you had, say, a decillion gold and sacrificed the
population of a planet, you could even buy yourself into Godhood.
The wares available in the Gold Market will include ones from both worlds you have visited in the past,
and worlds you will travel to in the future, so that its slogan of offering truly anything actually holds true
for you, though the same price markup still applies. It'll also accept any currency you might have on you,
instead of only recognizing the gold coins used in the system. And since you're a VIP, you can even sell
things to the market, though you'll only get their normal prices for them instead of the marked up ones."
8,,400CP,Greenhouse Three,Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Or any other number you like, really. This greenhouse, either inserted into new worlds in a location of
your choosing or attached to your Warehouse, is perfect for growing all manner of magical plants. So
perfect, in fact, that it can grow new ones! In addition to several rows of plots and potted plants of all
kinds, it contains four larger plots; one at each corner, suitable for one large tree apiece. Planting any
kind of magical raw material, such as Re'em blood or unicorn hair, makes a tree that grows that material.
Liquid materials are stored in hard, coconut-like fruits on the tree, easily broken with concerted effort
but highly unlikely to spill, split, or otherwise damage the surrounding plant life no matter how volatile
your reagent is. Since it's a magically expanded greenhouse with literally every species of plant life in it,
it also has a bit of magic so that all you need to do is think of what you need and start walking down a
row, and you'll reach it within seven paces. All plants within this greenhouse are automatically cared for
and reach maturity within a maximum of one week. Plants are kept docile by the greenhouse's magic, so
don't worry about the Venomous Tentacula eating one of your ears while you're not looking. Doesn't
automatically update in future jumps, but you can bring new plants into it manually and incorporate
them into the greenhouse by planting them in the provided pots. A must-have for aspiring Potions
masters."
9,,400CP,Herb Garden,Azeroth,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"A herb garden designed however you wish. At the basic level this garden has all the herbs found on Earth
and in Classic WoW. Herbs picked here will not need to be replanted and will regrow on their own
without any help from you. There will always be enough herbs for whatever you may need them for, but
if you pick more than 100 herbs within a month they will need time to rest before they regrow taking
one month to do so. You can attach this to your warehouse, a pocket dimension, or import it into the
world of Future Jumps.
* If you really want to you can keep the increasing CP cost by 50 CP for every WOW expansion."
10,,400CP,Metal of the Gods,The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Fourth Time,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Adamantite. Mythril. Orichalcum. Magical metals of incredible power. Adamantite and Mythril are
opposites, in a way. The first, incredibly sturdy, the perfect material to defend against the physical world.
Mythril, on the other had, has anti-magic effects, defending against spells just as well as Adamantite
does against physical blows, while also being capable of damaging spirits. Finally, there is Orichalcum,
the metal of the Gods, having resistance against both physical and magical blows even greater than the
other two. The metals of Gods, which are now at your hands. You have a replenishing supply of each
material, enough to forge from their raw forms an entire suit of plate armor, a shield, a spear, and a
sword. This supply, should it be used or sold, will replenish once every year, though it should be noted
that those with the ability to forge from these great metals is far and few between. Post jump, you will
also receive an equal supply of any other metals considered divine alongside the ones provided here
from any setting's visited, including those created by you or others."
11,,400CP,Qian Yuan's Treasure Vault,Talisman Emperor-Mortal Dimension,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Chen Xi encountered a treasure vault much like this one in the Oceanic Desert. While he had to fight
several cultivators to get away with the treasure, you'll have an easier time, as this vault attaches to your
Warehouse or inserts into jumps in a location only known to you (you may make this choice for each
jump). The Vault contains 4,096 doors, and behind each door is a space containing a particular item:
medicinal pills suitable to aid in cultivation or to recharge Essence during battle, piles of rare materials
like White Refined Gold, Water Netherstone, Six-Yang Crimson Iron, Azure Heart Wood, suitable for
equipment refinement and alchemy, gardens filled with varieties of spirit herbs and flowers in effect, if
it's a material used to craft something, it can probably be found here. The materials slowly replenish
themselves so long as they aren't completely used up (and there is no material which is singular - you
cannot completely use up a material unless you are in a hurry to craft something big), and you can add
materials from future jumps to the vault to have them gain the same benefit."
12,,400CP,Quintessence Fountain,Exalted - The Sidereals,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"This large jade fountain will be installed in your warehouse. Every time someone offers a prayer with no
other place to go, one that there is no other spirit who will hear, it will be drawn to the fountain and
become a droplet of the shining liquid called Quintessence. When someone prays to you or one of your
companions, it will instead merge together with other such prayers to eventually form a rainbow colored
block of Ambrosia that floats in the fountain. A quick prayer to the fountain will summon craftsgods to
fashion whatever mundane material or object you wish from these substances. Things made from
Quintessence will be wondrous but temporary, food that will disappear if not eaten or clothes that will
fade to nothing after a month. Objects made from Ambrosia will be permanent and can include Jade or,
unlike regular Ambrosia, Starmetal. Another fountain (or even several, if the property is big enough) will
appear on each other area that you take with you between worlds."
13,,400CP,The Mine,Azeroth,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"As the name suggests, this is a mine. At a basic level, which you get with the first purchase, you get basic
metals of which you can find on Earth and Classic WoW. You will gain all ores of that expansion and all
previous ones. Your mine will grow in size adding additional floors representing the different expansions
for each purchase of this item. The mine will never run dry, but it can be depleted if you gather the ore
too quickly. Give the mine a month and it'll be back up to full capacity. You can place this mine anywhere
in future Jumps that you wish or within your own pocket dimension, if you have one.
* If you really want to you can keep the increasing CP cost by 50 CP for every WOW expansion."
14,,400CP,Trade Goods,Youjo Senki - Saga of Tanya the Evil,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"How about an investment to kickstart your business? You now own a handful of warehouses full to the
brim with coal, iron, lumber, cloth, and various other materials. While not immediately useful, the local
government will really need these if they end up going to war. Alternately, use it yourself for something.
Refills at the end of each week."
15,,600CP,Alchemical Haven,Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"This is a plot of land about three hundred and fifty thousand square miles large that would keep getting
bigger to accommodate additional plants, accessible through a door in your warehouse. Inside this
dimension, you will find soil that adapts itself to grow whatever is planted in it, and an atmosphere that
will change itself to meet the demands of each and every plant as needed, transforming some areas into
barren, frozen wastelands, and others into fiery hellholes. To add to this, the Alchemical Haven
automatically harvests fruits and replants seeds, meaning that the only intervention needed for it to stay
operational is the introduction of new seeds. It can even speed up time for some plants so that they can
be planted and harvested as much as you wish. However, this only works when there are no sentient
beings within the dimension. Before you plant anything, there are several mortal ranked fruits and
spiritual grasses already planted and matured for you to use that altogether may allow you to enter the
Zifu stage, if you already possess the required insights.
* This items time acceleration component is unique among plant growth garden items"
16,,600CP,Go To Hel,Kamen Neo-Heisei Rider Part 2.5 - Gaim,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"It would appear you have happened across an oddly fertile patch of Helheim. Any seeds you plant here
will grow into Helheim plants that produce Lockseeds of the source of the seeds. You could even try
crossbreeding the resulting plants to create Lockseeds that grant armaments based on a mix of the two
donor plants. While this can get you some very potent Lockseeds, keep in mind it won't necessarily scale
directly with the fruits, and something on the level of the Forbidden Fruit would take ages of effort and
many unusual fruits to even begin to approach it. After the jump, this patch becomes attached to your
Warehouse, giving you a stable Helheim patch free of Invess except any you make."
17,,600CP,Heavenly Azure Profound Jungle,Against the Gods!,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Pills, pellets and crystals are a cornerstone of cultivation. Even one or two powerful pills can redefine the
fates of entire clans or sects, as it so happens. Equally important, however, are Profound Beasts, or
rather their bodies. There is the blood, which is a great tool in cultivation, the flesh and bones, used for
their own purposes, but the most special are the Profound Cores found within these beasts that make
life in so many parts of these worlds so difficult.
You have something completely amazing, in that regard. This is a dense jungle, attached to your
warehouse, filled with all sorts of dangerous profound beasts. As a matter of fact, it has one of every
single species and race of Profound Beasts in this setting, all ready and waiting for you. Because you see,
while the blood, flesh, bones, core and everything of these beasts is at the level they're supposed to be,
their actual fighting abilities are dramatically lower. Three entire realms lower, as a matter of fact. That is,
the Emperor level monsters can only do damage on the level of a True Realm monster, and so on. Unless
you want them at full power for some reason, that is, Then they are.
This doesn't apply to beasts below the Sky Profound Realm, so the weakest any of them get is to
Elementary. Also, each Realm monsters are isolated in their own 'zone' of the Jungle they practically
never leave, with the weakest ones on the outermost circle and so on. The numbers of the beasts inside
are proportional to how rare they are in the outside world, as is the rate of replenishment if killed. Even
the rarest beasts only take a few months, though, maybe a full year for the absolute rarest of them. In
future worlds, the Jungle provides beasts from the local setting too."
18,,600CP,Let there be Light,The Games We Play,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"And so there is. This is a replenishing supply of neutral Sephirot components of all ten kinds, for all your
soul crafting needs without the horribly unethical gathering process and terrible guilt.
You get 1000 people's worth of pure, high quality Sephirot a day, the stuff souls are made of. It's so high
quality that each is worth a hundred of your average souls, if not more. Don't worry about losing any
unused stuff either, because it builds up as time goes on. Sephirot is some of the most valuable stuff in
the world here, and that's for a reason.
In this world, the ratio of Sephirot within your soul determines its structure, the power of your
Semblance and other such things. In future worlds, it could be entirely different, luckily enough you get
the local stuff no matter where you go, allowing you to keep up your tinkering. And again, don't worry
about losing access to any of the past stuff. Each setting's soul stuff will continue to produce itself
separately from a separate setting.
But what use does it have in the future? Depends on where you go and how it all works there, but you'll
have to figure that yourself for the most part. Maybe you can eat it."
19,,600CP,Mineral caverns,Trinity:Aberrant,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"A sprawling network of natural caverns that you have expanded on, these tunnels are surprisingly cozy.
There's about as much space in the caverns as a large shopping mall, and you can rearrange things to
your liking. You'll also need to install amenities yourself, the caverns begin with nothing but bare stone
walls. Changes you make inside are retained, and you can choose to have appropriate properties
attached to the caverns at the beginning of each jump. The main appeal of these caverns is that unusual
mineral formations occlude any energy emissions, from inside or outside. Sensors, super-senses, magic
and 'other' will register the caverns as an area of undisturbed rock, no matter who or what is inside."
20,,600CP,Mithril Mines and Armory,Lord of the Rings - Twilight of the North,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"There may be older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world, but there are great
treasures and opportunities to be found in those places as well. Dwarven miners know this, and the lure
of mithril often proves irresistible. With this, you need not worry about the presence of any Balrog or
Orcs, as your veins of mithril shall lie within a mine dropped into a location near to where you start or
even just connected to your Warehouse. The great quantities of mithril that these mines make available
allow Dwarf-smiths, should you have invited any, to craft marvellously strong and light armor for your
warriors or yourself. More than simply a store-room and workshop for Dwarven smiths, a Mithril Armory
is capable of outfitting an entire host in the most supple and strong metal known in Middle-earth. The
presence of such materials naturally attracts the finest Dwarvensmiths, who may also turn their efforts
to forging superior weapons in addition to crafting mithril armor. Armored and armed in shining mithril
and dwarf-make weapons, your forces are certain to be fearsome indeed on the battlefield. In future
jumps, you will attract whatever setting equivalent to the Dwarves there happens to be. To find work in
your armory and lands."
21,,600CP,Natural Regeneration,World Seed,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"In Neolife, it wouldn't be wrong to say that magic is in everything. One interesting facet of this can be
seen in how on many worlds, dug earth and other natural resources are replaced by the ambient mana
over the course of a few weeks if there isn't anything like a support structure preventing it. While this is
certainly convenient, you thought to yourself, I can do better. After all, many important resources can't
even be found on planets, like mana gems or the insanely rare mineral osmium, which are only found on
asteroids. But with the ability you created, this won't be a problem anymore, because you can just
restore them anyway: simply by spending enough mana, it is possible for you to regenerate any natural
resource or duplicate existing ones.
You could pump mana into an asteroid to restore whatever it is that was mined there to get effectively
infinite resources out of it, do the same to the extremely valuable gem lying in front of you to get
multiple copies of it, or send out a massive wave of mana to cover a whole planet in a forest. The mana
required scales linearly with the amount of the resource you want to work with, its complexity, and its
power. So while you could easily get massive amounts of diamonds and wood even with a little mana,
duplicating something like the Top 5 metals (see Notes) or similar materials would require truly insane
amounts of mana."
22,,600CP,Starstuff,Peter Pan,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"A refilling bag of the mythical, green powder that can be produced from stars under rare occasion. It has
a variety of magical properties depending on who is exposed. Any animal exposed to the substance
transforms into a mythical, humanoid creature similar to its origin; for instance, a fish may become a
mermaid, or a bird may become a fairy, though not the normal kinds found in Neverland. Furthermore,
humans exposed to it can fly and can gain artistic inspiration; however, overexposure can lead to greed
and paranoia. Outside of this purchase, the substance is extremely difficult to find in the traditional Peter
Pan, unless the setting was changed. Also, unlike its form in the story, the Starstuff cannot be used to
destabilize the fabric of the universe."
23,,600CP,Supreme Emerald Spirit Garden,Against the Gods!,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"This is a garden worthy of being in legends, Jumper. A vast expanse of earth richly covered with grass,
located in either an attachment to your warehouse, one of your other pocket dimensions or on a real
world spot of your choice, this has exactly as much space as needed for its purposes. Which are twofold.
Firstly, it has prime, finest-quality samples of every single herb, flower etc in existence. It doesn't matter
how rare or valuable they are, you can find at least one of every one, and potentially many more. Plants
breed and spread at rates proportional to their rarity and rates of breeding in the outside world.
Something like the Emperor Awakening Heart Lotus, a plant normally found once in centuries or
millennia, takes a full year to bloom, and others take proportionately lesser time.
In future jumps the garden won't acquire any plants that are absolutely unique, like Yggdrasil in Norse
Myth, but everything else is fair game, even divine or mythical plants of all types. And as for those
plants, you need to find a seed and sow them here, at which point they become as any other plants.
Additionally, this garden has the property of 'adapting' any plants seeded here to the local settings. That
is, a fruit that provides ki or magical energy in its original world would provide Profound Energy in this
one, and the equivalent in future settings. They retain the ability to provide any previous 'versions' at
your will."
24,,800CP,Tenebrium Basics | Tenebrium Mine,Divinity - Original Sin,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Tenebrium Basics (200CP) Tenebrium is an odd mineral. It grows like a crystal, but can be melted and
forged like iron. It is easily enchanted, but highly resistant to other kinds of magic. In addition, it is highly
dangerous and inflicts a disease known simply as Rot upon all those who handle it in any form. Worst of
all, Rot cannot be cured by simple magical spells, requiring rare and powerful artifacts to cleanse the
infected. Most cannot afford such things and slowly wither over the months following handling a single
chunk of crystal. But with this perk, you have come to understand how to safely handle Tenebrium
without infecting yourself.
Tenebrium Mine (600CP) Tenebrium is an utterly useful material, for all that it is also incredibly
dangerous to handle. Still, considering all its uses, one can hardly be blamed for desiring to have a steady
supply of the crystal on hand. The Tenebrium Mine attaches directly to your Cosmic Warehouse and
takes the form of a traditional mining tunnel about a hundred feet deep. Inside one will find a few dozen
crystals of Tenebrium growing, each large enough to produce a single ingot when smelted. Once
harvested new crystals will slowly grow in their place over the course of a week. The mine is also capable
of producing other metals, crystals, and even gemstones if given a sample of such material. These will
form in veins along the walls of the tunnel, but grow much more slowly. Exotic metals will form at a rate
of one ingot every two weeks and crystals will produce roughly the same amount. Gemstones seem to
be easier and the mine will produce a collection of small stones that will fill a cupped hand in a week.
Normal metals, like gold and silver, can also be produced at a rate of one ingot per week. An ingot here
refers to enough material to forge a traditional longsword with."
25,,800CP,Collector,Fate/Legends - Oasis Fantasy,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Gold as far as the eye can see. An endless sea of treasures, like a desert where every dune is a mound
containing the legends of a hundred different tales. Before you is a great golden portal in the air, within
which these endless treasures constantly shift and swirl before you. It is like a Gate, one that leads to the
source of so much wonder. All that you can see is now yours and it is even more valuable than you might
think at first.
The power you now possess is to be the Collector of all of Humanity's creations. Every invention, every
making, every forging, every last creation that mankind has created, is creating or will create is found
within this endless vault of space. However, this only applies to singular creations. Any mundane and
magical weapon or vehicle or potion or book or armour or anything else in that vein can be found
present in here. However, outright locations cannot be found. While one may find the individual
buildings in a city or collective fortress, they would not find the city itself. Nor will the vault contain
things that are merely slight alterations to non-human objects. A mountain that has a castle on it or a
stone stuck to a stick. Mankind has created a great many things but for it to apply to our vault's contents,
it must be wholly a creation of man. A metal blade might be made from natural materials but it has been
shaped and altered thoroughly through human processes. A last note on the contents of the vault, is that
anything retained within it will not be harmful, even if it normally should be, to the owner of the vault
while within this space and that you are able to use anything within this space, regardless of the normal
conditions some magical items may have for their users.
You can summon the vault's portals with a few moments concentration or through the turning of one of
several golden keys from within this vault that you can obtain. These portals can be made anywhere
within your sight range, even should you not be looking where you form them at the moment, and are
very quick to open. While you do not know the exact nature or presence of everything within the
dimensional space, you can instantly call anything from the vault to your person as you wish and search
within it for anything that fits any kind of specifications you have in mind. With just a thought, you can
even organise the space and it's contents however you might choose. Setting it up as a great golden
museum instead of the endless desert of treasure, for example.
Once you have opened the portal to your vault once, you can freely continue to open them at an
incredible pace within your range, even dozens at once or enormous portals through which an entire
castle could pass. Through these portals, you can bring forth anything within your vault, no matter how
large or how far in. You may also choose to fire out things from within the vault, with the maximum
speed that you can do so rising with your magical power. Even at a base level however, you can fire the
smaller objects within at the speed of sound. Anything that exits the vault can be instantly retrieved with
just a thought, replacing it within the vault due to the effects of an artefact. Due to the same magical
item within the vault, anything that is sourced from the vault originally will slowly repair or, if destroyed,
reappear entirely within the vault over the course of a few days. Items made for single uses however will
not repair or reappear. The final and perhaps most notable attribute of this quality of yours is that your
vault has not ceased growing. While the space only draws from this current timeline and world, as you
travel to new worlds or timelines, you will find that the space you have access to will fill itself with all the
achievements of humanity from each new world and timeline at an instant."
26,,800CP,Shadow Economy | Discreet Purchaser,Lords of the Night - Liches,Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale,"Shadow Economy (100CP) You have great, even excessive wealth available. This isn't exactly the same as
having wealth - rather, money issues are taken care of. If you look to buy a small town, you'll have
enough wealth around to get it started, and after that initial payment expense will never show up again,
being taken care of before it ever reaches you. The first level takes care of expenses as if a level twenty
expert was diverting his income to paying for you. Each additional purchase, to a maximum of four
purchases, adds another one. This means that in good times, this can cover more, and in bad times, less.
Discreet Purchaser (100CP) There are many things you might want and need that are... annoying to get.
Maybe for legal reasons, maybe because no one buys that much gold, or the world you're on doesn't
have magic scrolls. Each purchase of this means that you get half as much value as you get from the
Shadow Economy diverted to you... in goods. They don't have to be goods available in your current
world, or things you can legally get. They discreetly show up when you need them, even if getting them
should take a long time, or involve some kind of commission. These goods can be improvements to your
properties, installations, constructions, or upgrades, but no other kind of service.
* The purchasing power of a level 20 is around 880,000 gold per year
* The purchasing power of 4 x level 20's is around 3,520,000 gold per year
* Discreet Purchaser lets you buy things that don't have to be available in your current world, including
improvements to your properties, installations, constructions, or upgrades"
