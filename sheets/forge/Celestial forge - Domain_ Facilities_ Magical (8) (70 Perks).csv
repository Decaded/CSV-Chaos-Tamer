0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,100CP,Alchemist's Laboratory ,Overlord - The Series ,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A fully fitted and supplied alchemist's laboratory ready for your use. It comes with the highest quality supplies and equipment required to make magical potions, allowing you to make potions to emulate the effect of any spell you know that could be reasonably made into a potion via alchemy (assuming you know alchemy, at least). The equipment will automatically upgrade itself relative to your own personal skill level, so the more skilled you are the better it will be to reflect that. Reagents for common potions restock themselves automatically on a regular basis.
The100 CP version includes the reagents for rare and much higher quality potions that will restock themselves, and additionally a store-front will be added to the front of your laboratory, allowing you to profit from your efforts. It also comes with a sales clerk and an alchemist of exceptional talent if still within reasonable limits (read: not Realm of Heroes or Level One Hundred) whom will produce and sell potions for you. You get potions for free, and get a cut of all profits the store makes. The laboratory, sales clerk, and alchemist will follow you jump to jump, although the clerk and alchemist aren't the same people jump-to-jump (unless you purchase the Guild Base option, in which case they can be if they are part of the Guild Base). No one will question the presence of this store or the potions it makes, even in places or worlds where it would be highly irregular. You get to choose where the laboratory is located in this and future jumps."
2,,100CP,Alchemy Workshop ,Endless Legend,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Build into a wagon, this full scale workshop allows for scientific research in the field, and provides all the tools the aspiring researcher needs to learn about the world they are in. Just don't blow yourself up or blind anyone, ok?
* Not many of that workshops are mobile"
3,,100CP,Auto-smelter ,Azeroth,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"This Auto-Smelter will smelt down any raw ore placed inside it into high quality ingots. This smelter is completely hands free, except for actually placing the ore inside. For further incentive, if you purchased The Mine you will be given a group of magical constructs who will mine your ore, place it in the Auto-Smelter, then sort out the finished product. They can not be used for anything outside of their primary functions stated above."
4,,100CP,House of the Witch,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Every young witch's favourite birthday present, at least until they know how to make it themselves. This small house is rather rudimentary when it comes to living necessities but quite filled out in regards to potion making. Not only does it have a high quality set of tools and appliances towards creating potions, poisons and designing magical rituals, it also comes with a weekly replenishing stock of low to mid range potions in the pantry. From youth restoring drinks, potions to plump or slim down the form, some love potions and even a few useful for combat potions that can temporarily improve strength and speed. The house also always has a fresh batch on pancakes ready on the stove, covered in your choice of delicious topping"
5,,150CP,Portable Examination Station ,Van Helsing,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A portable study centre - magnifying glass, vials, all held within a tightly-locked briefcase. As well, comes with a variety of supernatural samples - from vials of different blood types of demons and werewolves, to vampire fangs, demonic horn shavings, ghoul teeth, and ectoplasm from a great variety of undead."
6,,200CP,A Barrier of Perspective ,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"You have an extensive understanding of the arts required to create Gensokyo in the first place. Gensokyo’s boundary works off of perspective – one could travel between two similar barriers (such as between Gensokyo and the Lunar Capital) without ever leaving Gensokyo, but at the same time if they were to ever try to fly to the edges they’d “see” themselves traveling great distances while not actually moving at all, only discovering how little they moved when they turn around. You could use this easily to craft your own sealed dimensions."
7,,200CP,Alchemy Machine ,Spiral Knights,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A personal Variation of the machine you'll come to see all over the cradle. This one allows for a degree of experimentation that none of the other machines will, and is capable of accepting a great variety of materials without taking any damage. You'll be able to tweak existing recipes, or even come up with new ones all together with enough time. Who knows, you might stumble on something good."
8,,200CP,Alchemy Workshop ,Unmodded Minecraft,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"This small room has only a workbench and a chest that hold a miscellany of reagents and alchemy supplies. The chest will provide a small but steady supply of glass vials, water, and nether wart, the things which form the basis of all Minecraft potions. Occasionally when opened the chest will also have a small amount of glowstone, redstone, or gunpowder for use. Post-jump, the chest will update to provide a similar supply of anything a world's alchemy absolutely requires to get started, along with small amounts of random low-level ingredients."
9,,200CP,Ars Creation Tools ,BlazBlue,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Tools required to make Ars Magus and Ars Armagus. Without these, creating such things would be impossible, because creating the converter to let the user manipulate Seithr requires these specialized tools for the process to work properly.
* The doc contains a knowledge perk to use the tool, rember to remove both together if you decide not to keep them"
10,,200CP,Artifact Forge ,Azeroth,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"This forge grants you every appearance in the game of your Artifact Weapon and allows you to alter the appearance of your weapon at any time. In future Jumps it will allow you to alter the function of your weapon at any time. Turning swords into spears or axes into daggers. I'll even allow you to use it to change a pistol into a rifle, or something similar. The forge will also serve as a medium allowing you to more easily enchant and create powerful weapons which you can imbue with powerful magical effects."
11,,200CP,Castle Jumper ,Marvel Magic,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"What is the point of living if you don't do it in style? Certainly, you know the importance of aesthetics even in the face of practicality... but that does not mean that something can't be both stylish and practical. You are the proud owner of a large european castle. It's practically straight out of a storybook, having stone walls, great towers -- hell, the thing even has a moat. However, despite its ancient appearance, it is fully updated to the modern times. Possessing everything from standard amenities such as running water and electricity to a state-of-the-art security system and laboratories. The way you live should make a statement, a fact that you seem to understand very well.
* This is the only laboratory that is state of the art that comes from Marvel comics. Not the movies like the Fantastic Four CandyLand. Let me repeat that. This is the only state of the art laboratory from Marvelcomics.
* Marvel comic 'state of the art' is absurdly stronger than the movies so might be worth to keep."
12,,200CP,Delfire Forge ,Ravenwood,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Actually three items. A single, moderately powerful orb of delfire, a metal frame that can store an orb of delfire and allow the one that holds it to use the orb without being a kiln, and a large furnace that, if you plug the frame into it while it holds an orb of delfire, can be used to treat metals with arcane energy while also acting as a forge."
13,,200CP,Deplorable Forge of Tormented Souls ,Exalted - The Abyssals,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. While the willingness to do so must come from yourself, almost everything else can be bought right here,providing you with equipment and inexhaustible supplies of the raw materials ones need to forge a soul into steel.
Full usage of the craft requires artifacts to forge the metal, a hammer and anvil composed of soulsteel or jade (whichever you prefer) to hammer the molten ghost-alloys into shape, another artifact known as an Essence-forge to melt down the unfortunate ghost's corpus and other materials, soulfire crystals replete with essence to stoke the forge, and black ores taken from the Labyrinth to grant it the ghastly, magical strength of soulsteel.
Even the alchemical agents, wrought from the Labyrinth, which are needed to create the rarefied void-coated plates of Oblivion's Panoply are in refilling supplies amongst these, should you have need of them. With this, the only thing you would still require for your dread craft is a supply of souls to feed your forge.
* The new CF has some souls available in supplies that can be used guilt free."
14,,200CP,Ding!,Girl Genius SB,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Well, this is different. A certain gentleman called Von Neumann would be delighted, at least. You are now the proud master of a full set of Dingbots of your own, or similar clanks or drones, at least. They're all minor sparks in their own rights, and can themselves build more of their kind, even though those don't have the spark.
Led by a Prime, they are connected with you on an intrinsic, mental level, being fully capable of building any and all devices or works you can. They get everywhere, performing construction upkeep, salvage and everything else you might need them to. Not even needing blueprints, they seem to draw upon your knowledge directly, using their in-built tools to perform all the things you normally would need to do yourself, making everything you'd like them to... and a lot of them you wouldn't. Don't leave them unsupervised."
15,,200CP,Enchanting Board ,Scooby Gamers,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"You have a certified enchanting board. Not only does it allow multiple people to pool their mana in order to fuel the enchanting process, every person that donates mana to the project also gains the same amount of 'experience' as the person doing the enchanting. Enchantments made to things using this board are guaranteed to be more effective than they would be with a normal enchanting board."
16,,200CP,Magical Laboratory ,World Seed,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Now this is a fitting lab for an aspiring scientist, mad or not. It has all the tools and equipment needed to contain and study any kind of magical creature and phenomenon, or to bring arcane secrets of the universe to light. And should you ever not have the right machinery at hand for whatever you want to do, the lab will upgrade itself and produce what you need in an instant. Now, the only thing holding you back will be the limits of your own intelligence. After this jump, it will attach itself to your warehouse, and may appear in any location you desire in other worlds you might visit."
17,,200CP,Portable Workshop ,Divinity - Original Sin,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Being constantly on the move, Source Hunters are forced to find ways to ensure they have the tools of their craft even when far from their headquarters. This set of three small, metal charms are relics of an age past that were confiscated and put to better use. By pulling one off the chain that binds them, an easy act when one actually desires it, the holder can have what they require. Place the charm on the ground and a Forge springs into existence, hot and ready to be used. Or a campfire crackling cheerfully and ready to warm the air. The final charm is a Workbench, which includes a grinding wheel and all the small tools a budding alchemist might need to construct grenades, arrows, or even the smaller magical charms. By touching the small symbol etched into each, they will revert back to their charm form and hop back onto the chain in an instant. Should you accidently lose one or be forced to leave one behind, it will reappear on the chain at the next full moon"
18,,200CP,Skyforge ,The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"An ancient, mysterious, eagle themed forge added to your warehouse. Any metal items crafted at the forge will be significantly harder and stronger for it. Something about the fires."
19,,200CP,The Armoire of Abiele ,World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"This exceptionally crafted antique mahogany French Armoire was crafted at some point during the 19th century by Abiele Dumont, a famed fashion designer so that she'd always be fabulously dressed. Whispering your clothing desire into the keyhole then turning the key allows you to pull out a fabulous outfit made of the finest spider silk. The outfits fit perfectly and are quite comfortable."
20,,300CP,Crafting Stations ,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Crafting Stations Stations that are used with your ability to craft items. Each of them is easily collapsible with your inventory ability. Cost is for advanced option.
Basic Comes with a workbench [any style], furnace, iron or lead anvil, and three of the following crafting stations: Alchemy Table, Sawmill, Loom, Cooking Pot, Dye Vat, Heavy Work Bench, Keg, Teapot, Glass Kiln, Ice Machine, Living Loom, Solidifier, Extractinator

21,,300CP,Enchanted Anvil ,Geneforge,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A powerful artifact which allows the crafting of enchanted equipment, so long as one has the right materials. Normally they are effectively immovable and thus bound to a specific location, this one is easily moved, as far as large heavy anvils go."
22,,300CP,Mystical Forge ,Jade Empire,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"You have obtained a forge capable of creating gems, as well as upgrading any of your weapons to their fullest potential. The staff known as Golden Star can become Tien's Justice, the sword known as Fortune's Favorite can become the Demon Sword. Furthermore, this forge can upgrade your own weapons, increasing the skill it takes to use them, but enhancing their abilities by 50% ... provided you are willing to think of a cool name and backstory for them. The forge is a stickler for tradition.
* It's Gem creation ability is mostly useless, but adding a empowering backstory to a weapon is cool"
23,,300CP,Nine Elements Cauldron ,Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A cauldron that is typically used to melt down treasures for their elemental essence, so that someone can then repurpose them into forging a new treasure that is even stronger than the many that were melted down. Unlike others, however, this one seems to be able to melt down items of any level, and can remember the traits of any treasures it melts down and apply them to other items."
24,,300CP,Ritual Room ,Highschool DxD,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"It's a little difficult to practice complex magical formulas in public, so you came prepared. This is a room styled to your preferred magic system of choice, and all magic you personally perform within this room will enjoy both greater efficiency in mana and greater power. Also comes with spooky robes and basic ritual equipment and reagents for free."
25,,300CP,Swordsmith's Hut ,Fate/Legends - Land of the Rising Sun,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A bounded field manifested by only the greatest smiths in the land. To make a blade, you no longer need some massive static forge or a complement of sturdy tools. Your workshop remains with you at all times, as much a part of your being as the hands with which you make your art. This magical field you possess allows you to integrate crafting tools and structures that you possess into a bounded field, letting you manifest them at will. This may appear as the structures appearing from nowhere or as overlaying the effects on the existing environment, turning a natural rock bench into a sturdy anvil or a running stream into a fully capable quenching bath for hot steel. Your field is already equipped with all the tools expected of a master swordsmith in this land, as well as potent magical enhancements that improve any crafting efforts made within the field. Creations will be sturdier, sharper, lighter and more adaptable to their wielders even without any skill on your part. You may freely combine new structures and tools into this field, likely mixing them with the existing additions, to continually build on your new everpresent workshop."
26,,300CP,"Tower of Sorcerae | Floating Isle | Moving Locations | Arcane | Sorcerae | A Memory Of The Face 
Of Creation ",Lords of the Night - Liches,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Tower of Sorcerae (100CP) You have a tower dreamt into reality. Maybe by you, maybe by someone else, but it was never made a concrete and defined thing. It starts out a thing the size of a city block, and thirty stories high. It can be something of stone, or glass, or crystal, or wood. When no one is watching it, the tower can change its outer facade. Inside it has a basic layout, though you can change that layout whenever it is unobserved by people other than you. Both the inside and out will repair themselves over time, and the tower may slowly shift itself, faster if unobserved, though still slowly.
The tower echoes any crafting perks you possess, gaining technologies and magics in keeping with the secrets and arts you've seized. You may feed the tower vast quantities of Arcane over time to make it grow. You may make it grow in luxury, making everything inside the tower higher quality over time and more comfortable and beautiful. You may make it grow in utility causing it to grow embedded magical items, and if you have the perks, technological ones. You may make it grow in size, becoming broader or taller or both, or even make it grow inside without growing outside, though that's even more expensive.
If you make the Tower a bound artifact, all those functions will be enhanced. You can also have it already on legs, or other appropriate mechanisms, so that it can move about. You may import an existing property as your Tower, though if that combination would be especially powerful you must pay an extra 100cp for the privilege.
Floating Isle (100CP) Your Tower flies, and so does a modest amount of land around it. Enough for a small family farm though like with the rest of the tower it's possible to expand this. The weather's always pleasant - the air elementals bound to moving it make sure. They're quick to defend the tower if need be, and there are many permanent unseen servants to invisibly serve guests and do work about the place. And the elementals can push the tower at a decent pace.
You get about a dozen elder air elemental servants. If killed, they will come back in a day and a night. They can't leave the premise, but otherwise faithfully obey you. They're also surprisingly bright, for elementals at least. You know methods of binding more with the same properties should you require them, though it is neither a fast nor easy process.
Moving Locations (100CP) Your tower has several dozen portals to major population centers, a few smaller towns, and an interesting hidden place of wonder or magic. It has this... for every major plane of existence in the local cosmology, and several of the minor ones. These portals form extensions of the tower on the other end, small buildings or annexes built of the towers essence.
The portals work automatically for you, and you can key other people to use them. Minions created by your power always count as 'keyed,' unless you've unkeyed them. The portals are near impossible to notice for those not keyed to them, and would require something on the level of epic magic or similar in order to force open. All of the portals are clearly marked as to where they go... but only to those that are actually keyed to using them.
Arcane (0CP) You have traded away Life for a measure of the Arcane, writing the truth of yourself upon the fabric of Reality. It is the Wellspring of Creation, the fire from which things become Possible. It opposes destruction and stagnation. Though it's worth noting that a nova consuming a world full of life and culture doesn't qualify as 'destruction' or 'stagnation.' Merely change, and change is interesting.
Arcane has a kind of supremacy over mortal magics - not just normal arcane magic either. An Arcane Lich can strip a Dragon of its breath, a Beholder of its gaze, and a Sorcerer of their spells. Such work are the products of specialized Arcana, formal techniques some Liches learn. The converse is not true. An Anti-Magic field does nothing to something fueled with Arcane, while an Arcane Null-Magic Field shuts down mortal magic. An Arcane Item won't show up to Detect Magic, won't be damaged by Disjunction, and 
generally speaking ignores all such forces.
In future jumps, it's safe to treat Arcane as a 'higher' force, except when it runs against other explicitly 'higher' reality rewriting forces, such as the Power Cosmic of Marvel or Flame Imperishable of LotR. It can affect the 'lesser forces', and they cannot affect it. On its own, this perk gives you a small pool of Arcane which can be used several ways
* You can fuel Sorcerae - unstructured magic where you simply create the effect you want.
* You can transfer it from or to another being or object that can hold it. This can't be used to steal it from another being or to grant the ability to hold or use Arcane to people that cannot already do so. As its own regeneration rate is trivial, storing Arcane energy in prepared crystal and gemstone receptacles ahead of time is the normal method of getting it.
* Your creative mental energies lets you slowly dream more of it into being. Mechanically your regeneration rate is tied to your Intelligence.
* You can see Arcane Script, a magical language written in Arcane energies. It has some use in magical items. If you know the script (which you do), you can also write it, though that costs energy. It's possible to drain the Arcane energy used to write the script, erasing what was written.
* They can develop Arcana, special disciplines fueled by their Arcane energies. Arcane naturally recovers at a snail's pace for all but the most intelligent. More evolved liches gain bonuses to its recovery. However even for superhumanly intelligent spectral liches (the most advanced kind) the recovery rate for Arcane energy is still not terribly quick. (see notes)
Sorcerae (0CP) You can perform Sorcerae, dreaming what you want to happen into being. This is a dangerous power, and the very power the Guild of Wizards claim was used to bring Reality into being. There are ways of sensing its use, and mortal minds were not designed to bear witness to such shapings.
There are stacking bonuses and penalties to an attempt, but how difficult it will be and how much it will cost is a shifting thing. Taking extra time makes it easier, but also makes finding you easier for those keeping an eye out for such things.
* Spending extra Arcane can reduce the difficulty.
* The easiest form of this is dreaming into being an effect you could cast - the known spells of a Sorcerer or the prepared spells of a Wizard. The known spells, that aren't prepared, of a Wizard (and equivalents) are also pretty easy.
* Any spell you've seen cast, that matches a type you can cast. If you've cast it, you've seen it cast, so these bonuses often go together.
* Any other effect you've seen is a bit easier, but not much.
* A spell you can cast, but from an alternative source is a bit easier, but not as much. If you're a specialist wizard, and you somehow learn a forbidden spell, or if you have Cleric levels and decide to copy a Cleric spell, you use this modifier instead
* A spell from a type you can cast, that you haven't seen, is a little more difficult.
* A spell that isn't appropriate (Cleric, Druid, other spell list) is more difficult.
* A spell that's higher level then you can cast is more difficult.
* A completely new effect is even more difficult.
Such effects cost Arcana the more powerful they are, and with factors that increase difficulty. There are also some special modifiers.
* Truly destroying something, Be Not, involves a massive spike in cost.
* Making something real and permanent multiples the cost by ten. So if you can afford ten times the cost of Summon Monster IX, then you can permanently call such a set of helpers into being.
*Groups can pool their efforts to achieve greater effects.
A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (0CP) The power of the Arcane, and the necromantic forces that bolt it to a human soul... the mind was not built to cope with such things. Well, other people's minds might not be. You deal with it fine. In fact, you'll find that you deal with everything fine. Madness just doesn't 'take' when it's you. Your mind refuses to warp, your personality stays stable, and your view of reality matches what you sense and perceive.
* Just read the perk, its one of the best things in the CF, scaling, with unlimited potential for both magic and tech
* Limited reality warping styled magic free along with it and to fuel it
* Arcane energy was used to create the entire dnd multiverse of this setting."
27,,300CP,Volcanic Forge ,God of War,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"The Smith God's power is great, but it is not by his will alone that his works are forged. There is also his tools to consider, and with this you have one such tool.
Attached to your Warehouse is a small volcano, a fiery beast that will never fade and never falter. Its power is great, reducing the time you need to break down metals and minerals, reworking them into new forms while increasing their quality and inherent strengths. Should you choose, you may also take a significant hit in forging time to experiment with different metals and minerals, melting and combining them to create a different, newer resource with one quality from the second object in question. Rise, craftsman. Rise and begin your work."
28,,300CP,Wizard's Lab ,Dresden Files,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"More of an add-on than your own separate living space, this can either be built into a Residence you own, or add a trapdoor to your Warehouse and store it underneath. It comes equipped with everything you need for magical experiments short of a stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling: A built-in summoning circle, shelf after shelf of weird reagents and knick-knacks, a small library of interesting books about magic and the supernatural, and an actual laboratory for making potions and enchanting objects. It's also been heavily reinforced, so any failures or spills will at worst blacken the floors."
29,,300CP,Workshop Equipment ,Bloodborne,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"This is actually a package deal containing a variety of workshop tools. The first tool set has some basic tools for repairing equipment and some more specialized tools for upgrading weaponry with varying Blood Stones. The second set of tools allows for the slotting and removal of Blood Gems, items that as previously mentioned can greatly empower weaponry. The last set of tools allows you to etch Caryll Runes into the mind to attain their wondrous strength, or remove them just as easily. Runesmith Caryll, student of Byrgenwerth, transcribed the inhuman utterings of the Great Ones into what are now called Caryll Runes. Etching these runes into your mind can provide a number of benefits. Benefits can range from resisting certain types of damage, increasing resistance to various poisons or increasing stamina and vitality, among other effects. You may etch up to three runes into your mind at a time. These runes can be found scattered around this world.
* Enhance weapons by slotting in blood gems
* Transcribe eldritch god utterings into your mind for powers"
30,,400CP,Alchemical Foundry | Mythic Forge | Dust Refinery | Arcane Smelter,Endless Legend,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Alchemical Foundry (50CP) You gain the equipment needed to extract, process, and refine Titanium and Glassteel. It exacts about one ingot a week.
Mythic forge (150CP) You possess the tools to gather, refine, and process Mithrite and Hyperium. Good luck finding it, much less finding some that others haven't already claimed.
Dust Refinery (100CP) Able to infuse Dust with new life, the Refinery is the staple of Dust Enchantment. While Dust infused iron is common, it pales compared to the Dust enchantments this refinery allows. Allows for the crafting of Foci and magic rings, talismans, insignias, and tomes.
Arcane Smelter (100CP) A self-contained device used to extract, process, and refine Palladium and Adamantium. A must have for the smith on the go."
31,,400CP,Altar of Spellmaking ,Morroblivion,Domain: Facilities: Magical,Your own personal altar of spellmaking. Allows you to make spells. With Spellmaker increases efficiency of the process and quality of spells made.
32,,400CP,Arcanatarium ,Twokinds,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A trained mage can throw out spells on the fly, but the really impressive magic is prepared far in advance. For that, you'll need a place to work. This workshop is fully outfitted to support a practiced mage in all their pursuits. There's a permanent magic circle to focus your energies, a table of alchemical equipment for the brewing of potions, a well-stocked library full of tomes and scrolls of arcane knowledge, and any other dedicated workspace you'll need for working magic. This workshop also comes stocked with plenty of ingredients and materials for your alchemicy and artifact crafting, including rarer materials like precious metals and gems. You'll still need to provide any extremely rare or unique items, but this personalized workspace will have anything else you need for your own arcane pursuits. This property can take any form you wish, from a traditional tower to a basement laboratory. Post-jump, this workshop can be imported and attached to any property you own"
33,,400CP,Bio Lab ,Buso Renkin,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Homunculi don't really breed, so their reproduction is instead linked to creating more of their own. What this purchase does is add a respectable sized laboratory to either your property, or the warehouse, which contains all that you need (including instructions) on how to create basic humanoid and animalistic homunculi."
34,,400CP,Bleak Atelier of Necro-Engineers ,Exalted - The Abyssals,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Faith, magic and technology come together in the factory-cathedral. Within its walls were produced glorious wonders reserved for the greatest gods and Chosen. Almost none of these wondrous factory-cathedrals endure today, and those that remain are terribly damaged or lost to the impassable wilderness. But while practically no one alive could build a factory-cathedral today, the Deathlords are some of the few beings that could. Still, only one amongst the deathlords is officially known to possess an equivalent...
And now, you may acquire one of these wonders of dark design. Built as a great tower, this imposing manse has been designed to serve both as a factory-cathedral reminiscent of those built in the First Age and as an equally effective necrosurgery laboratory using more recent designs pioneered by the Deathlords. Unlike the hallowed cathedrals built by the Solars of old, these halls have not been sanctified or constructed as a temple-manse. Instead, special precautions have been taken to ensure the cold, sterile perfection of the Abyssal Essence that powers the horrible machines within.
Within these workshops, long forgotten First Age tools are set side by side with just as sophisticated new innovations. Here, eldritch suspension vats preserve the dead. Essence-fueled welding tools fuse bone to bone. Flasks of reagents bubble and strange devices whir, spark and glow. The place carries about it a dark majesty that scares away most natural animals and invites bad weather, yet the environment stays oddly dry and cool. Black ornaments inset with iron, onyx, and obsidian further channel the manse's Essence into necromantic power, such that the costs of necromantic spells cast within the manse's walls 
are significantly reduced. Furthermore, the manse bolsters the strength of such spells beyond the capabilities of the necromancer's own Essence. All the better to animated the necrotic warmachines one might create within."
35,,400CP,Gromwood ,Skulduggery Pleasant V1.05,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"This house on a hill, large enough to be considered a manor, has come into your possession, perhaps after the death of a relative. While it has many rather ominous pictures on its walls and no small amount of unused sports equipment, the houses true appeal is what lies underneath it. Thought a secret passageway, you may access an extensive labyrinth hidden below the property. This labyrinth, called the Caves of the Void, is home to a variety of monsters capable of smelling magic, which they use to hunt intruders. You of course, won't be hunted by these beasts (unless you want to be, for whatever reason). Within this maze are veins of a special black crystal, which has been a key component used to create weapons like the Sceptre of the Ancients, capable of killing gods. And in the deepest part of the caves is the Source Fountain, a pool that turns whatever you place within it magical. The house is completely paid off, and has free running water, electricity, AC and secure internet."
36,,400CP,Magical Manor ,Fate/Stay Night,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"An expected part of your inheritance, the old family home. This is a two story redbrick home with lavish inner furnishings, all in a German style. The house seems to clean and take care of itself, even if a whole room is trashed beyond repair, it will be in pristine condition by morning. As comfortable as the house it is, its real draw is actually the basement hidden beneath the home. Completely undetectable without significant supernatural powers or actually blowing open the ground, this basement holds an extensive magical workshop. Filled with common and rare magical reagents and ingredients, both of which replenish over time. Numerous magical tools for crafting, enchantment and a variety of other disciplines can also be found here, as well as a fair sized but empty room for summoning. Magic cast here is undetectable to those outside the basement, though the basement itself is not indestructible in any way. If you blow the place up, people will notice."
37,,400CP,Miskatonic University ,Smash Up-Obligatory Cthulhu Supplement,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Home of the Fighting Cephalopods, this college campus has an unusually soothing atmosphere, a well-stocked library, and most curiously, everyone studying here benefits from any memory, training/learning booster or uncapper perks you personally possess."
38,,400CP,Prismatic Laboratory ,Fallen London,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"The principle of acute observation is light! And to that end, you have fashioned a workspace of lenses, liquids, critters and crystals to focus upon recreating a spectrum of lights fantastic. Ah, the impossible palette: those colors only seen in the Neath! You may not always produce something like it, but you will produce their inks and lenses in time."
39,,400CP,Progressive Estate ,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"No man of science is complete without his laboratory of choice and neither can a proper magus be found without a workshop to house his life's work. It's much more rare that both are found in the same place however. This rather luxurious, lush and expansive estate you now own, with a few hundred acres of land and very sizeable manor house, is really just the window dressing. Attached to that fancy house up there is a combined laboratory/mansion the size of the very mansion it is attached to. Filled with technology and academic research at the very cutting edge of the 20th century, and somehow a few steps further in some cases, on three different fields of technology as well as a wide range of magecraft tools, research and notes on three magical topics of choice that would be well regarded even in the upper echelons of the Mages' Association. While each side is already quite impressive, it is the small library regarding the efforts of the previous owner of the home to find applications towards mixing each side that is the hidden gold here. Notes on how to truly bring out the potential of technology with magecraft and vice versa are here. As well as all this, the entire estate, manor and laboratory are surrounded with multiple layers of defense and obfuscation of both technological and magical means. A small army could not break in, even if they could find the place. You may import a property into this."
40,,400CP,Temple of Solomon | An Age of Gods | Little Shadow | Sphinx Awlad ,"Fate/Legends - Oasis of 
Fantasy",Domain: Facilities: Magical,"-Temple of Solomon (400CP) A place that has long been abandoned or, at least, a replica of the one currently in use. The Temple of Solomon is perhaps the grandest magical workshop ever to be created, one so great that it does not even exist in the mundane world. Sealed away in imaginary number space, it is only accessible to others through highly complex and difficult magical workings, though you can enter your hidden base with nothing but a thought provided you are not blocked by some means. The temple itself is quite large, with the small dimension covering several city blocks of area and the building 
being the size of a large mansion. Within is almost every one of Solomon's personal notes and research on magecraft and magic, along with a great deal of lore from other famous magicians of his time and from later on as well. The small dimension has been connected to a replica of Solomon's created magical circuits which empower the framework the workshop sits on, serving to provide a immense magical fuel source for any project you might wish to run within this space as you can freely draw on the amount of energy the King of Magic had while alive when you are in here. Finally, death in this realm is not 
permanent and it is far easier to bring back those who die when it is within this place. For your purposes, this means that dying in this temple will not count as an end to your chain. You may import an existing structure into this role.
* Solomon made the entire modern magic framework that allows for magecraft in fate
-An Age of Gods (0CP) The Age of Gods is certainly a time to be alive. Humanity is far from as weak as it will become in the modern era, so you will require a suitable body to these early times. Should you be born later in this world’s life, after the Age of Gods has ended, you will be quite the anomaly. A human with a body from the Age of Gods yet born in the latter ages.
You have the physical and mental capabilities that any modern human would believe you are superhuman. You can tear through the stone or metal of the modern day without much exertion, perhaps even lift a tonne of weight over your head, and certainly outrun any horse. You have magical power unlike what appears to those who use magecraft, as you do not have magic circuits. Instead, through your body runs pure magical energy, allowing you to much more easily manipulate your own energy and that of the world around you. Of course, such a thing requires training to utilise to any real effect but once you have that training, there is no modern mage not considered a freakish prodigy that could level with you.
As befits a time of myths and heroes, you will be assured to be at least somewhat attractive and it is possible for your body to grow to somewhat inhuman degrees, though whether that manifests as being eight feet tall and bulging with muscles or the sort of beauty normally seen only in the depictions of fertility goddesses in the temples of Babylon…that’s still to be decided.
-Little Shadow (0CP) A slip of a girl, barely noticeable in the corner of your eye. She found you one day or you found her and she refused to accept that she’d been found. She was barely standing but still held a sharp knife firmly as she glared at you. A spared scrap of bread and those eyes changed quickly. Now she follows you around, claiming that it is her duty to protect your life, meeting you was just a sign from God. Soft purple hair is her only distinguishing feature but her hard eyes give away her training. A failed member of the Hassan, left behind with nothing more than a dutiful will.
She thinks of herself as a trained Hashashin even though she only knows simple knife fighting and basic stealth. Her eyes roam around, checking for weak points and hiding places, even if she doesn’t know what those are. Her cheeks get vibrantly red if you point this out and she will stomp slightly further away in a huff. Any hint of lessons or wisdom on her dream will be eagerly grasped however, her eyes starting to shine with wonder and hope. Maybe one day, she really will grow into the amazing assassin and protector the order believed she couldn’t hope to be.
-Sphinx Awlad (0CP) It’s only the cutest, cuddliest little thing in this sub-continental region. With skin in the pattern of the cosmos of stars, these kittens are offspring of one of the legendary Sphinxes of Egypt. The golden headdresses they wear, in the shape of little lion ears, is quite the hint. Fortunately, they’re as weak as actual kittens in strength and only as sturdy as a normal human, so this fella won’t need to be put in any sort of danger. They love to play around with gold and magic, bounding through the desert sand unbothered by the sun. This one looks up to you like a parent, affectionately nuzzling you and doing it’s best to look big and scary whenever it thinks someone is threatening you. It’ll be a long, long time before it grows up into a big bad lion though. Probably a few hundred years."
41,,400CP,Suzunaan ,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"You have a kasha-hon, a kind of traditional Japanese library, containing a wide variety of mostly-mundane books. On its own it will turn a mild profit, sufficient to live off and have minor hobbies on your own, but in addition it contains the materials for a traditional Japanese woodblock printing press. Books, scrolls and the like copied with the press will retain all the supernatural abilities of the original copy, enabling you to mass-produce enchanted papercrafts, though depending on the size of the book you are unlikely to be able to produce more than a few hundred every day of work, and producing the woodblocks to print will take some time on its own."
42,,400CP,The Alchemy Machine ,Shivers,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Created by the legendary alchemist Louis Garcon, this mysterious machine combines modern science with principles passed down from ancient Egyptian times. Should you have any alchemic ability or knowledge, using this machine will not only drastically enhance the potency of anything you create, but also significantly boost the output. Careful experimentation may even let you learn to automate the alchemic process, allowing the machine to produce indefinitely if provided with supplies. Without such knowledge, though, expect significantly more experimentation before you achieve anything of note."
43,,400CP,The Artful Temple That Is Not ,Exalted - The Infernals,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Unlike the many other Yozis, Oramus has no temples in the Demon City beyond the great prison-temple built atop his slumbering form. Thus, this temple cannot exist despite its meticulously artful design and wondrously magnificence the likes of which seem impossible to ever match in other architecture.
And in truth, this is correct. For this temple exists Beyond, the place of things which are cast out and never existed at all. All around it are floating worldscapes; upside-down places, angled places, in-and-out places. Existence seems to have the quality of a cube winding in toward a central locus, and all through the air floated things unguessed and never before seen.
Here, in these alien vistas beyond perception, which are an infinite forge of the impossible that stirred the very Wyld into forms and patterns by the movement of your thoughts, you may create and think on those things deemed impossible by all. Still, caution is for the wise, for while you are protected by reality within the walls of this temple, the outside is not so kind and should you get lost behind babbling brooks of names... you might find that you never really existed at all.
Of course, bringing this manse within Creation or Hell would defeat the very point of its construction. And so alternative measure have been devised. With but a sideways step through any doorway, the holder of the temple's hearthstone may step within its walls, and from inside you may also open a stable portal to other realms so that others might likewise enter."
44,,400CP,The Earth Forge ,Elder Scrolls Online,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Or rather a replica of it, attached to your warehouse or slotting into the world in the location of your choosing at the start of each jump. The Earth Forge is as much a fortress as it is a workshop, hidden far away prying eyes and located deep underground, its entrance guarded by a small fort carved out in ancient times. The Forge itself is located deep underground, only accessible by following a tunnel that can easily be used as a chokepoint to bottleneck an invading army or fortified into a near- impenetrable hall of traps and sealed dwemer-metal blast doors. It's real value however, is the smithy itself. Using flame salts (which never seem to run low), raw magma (which never seems to burn or cause heatstroke unless you physically leap into it) and a massive blast furnace (which never breaks or needs refueling) in addition to its magical nature and tools surpassing what even the Grand-Masters of Tamriel could hope to lay their hands on, the Earth Forge is quite possibly one of, if not the, greatest smith's workshops on Nirn, equaled perhaps only by the yet-undiscovered Aetherium Forge and the factories of Sotha Sil the Clockwork King. Comes with a small retinue of NPC guards to... well... guard it."
45,,400CP,The Hall of the Perfect Circle ,Exalted - The Solars,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"The Solar Exaltation is an engine of near perfection, split up into five parts. The castes serve to diversify the bearers of the exaltation and is brought into harmony within a perfect circle, a gathering of a single member of each of the five castes. And in honor of this most sacred harmony, this manse has been constructed. A great manor built in the style of the early first age, where perfect geometry and design met with principles of practicality and efficiency; a far cry from the ostentatious grandeur of the later years.
But within the main hall rests five doors in perfect symmetry, each bearing the mark of a different caste emblazoned upon their face. Behind each door lies a room constructed to push the abilities of the Lawgivers to their very limits, to awaken further understanding through adversity.
For the Bronze Tigers an ever shifting battlefield, complete with highly skilled automatons and simulated environments to push even the most skilled warriors to their very limits.
For the Golden Bulls therein lies a temple to the Highest of Holies, a place where they can focus and realign themselves to their cause. As an additional provision this temple also contains tools and features to help train resistance, such as meditations on a bed of spikes or walking across molten orichalcum.
For the Copper Spiders, a most wondrous forge to be theirs. Complete with all the tools required to construct some truly awe inspiring works of artifice should they possess the talent and the patience.
For the Iron Wolves, their room contains an ever shifting puzzle building. Fixed only when the door is opened this place is designed to push stealth and infiltration techniques to the highest possible level. However one other benefit is the owner can submit the plans to a compound, real or not, and find it simulated here as a way to test their skills through places of their own devising.
And finally for the Quicksilver Falcons, within their portal lies the ballroom of a magnificent manor. Within here simulacrums vie and jockey for social standing, ever perceptive to the slightest misstep and always eager for the slightest loophole in an agreement. After learning to survive and thrive in this merciless atmosphere, navigating most other social events is almost no effort at all."
46,,400CP,The Sixfold Weave of Sublime Efficacy ,Exalted - The Infernals,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Quite unlike the other manses on offer here, this is not actually a singular manse. Instead, it is a network of six smaller manses arranged in an artful pattern of geomantic resonance, empowering the central manse with the essence gleaned of the other five. Each created from white brass and inlaid with black basalt, the five are formed into slender towers that channel their essence towards the center, while on their own providing little more than a luxurious abode and a minor hearthstone.
It is the central manse that is of most note to you, though it is still build up a weaker demesne than the other manses you might acquire here, the difference is more than made up for by the creative power funneled into it by the supporting manses. A palace of white brass walls and ringed by streets of black basalt, it is a marvel to the eye built to be just as aesthetically pleasing as it is functional. Her walls are decorated with frescoes bearing differing images of the Mother of Creation and the demon princes descended from her, fortified to withstand the greatest of sieges. Her halls are lit with purest white flames that burn eternally, miniscule fragments taken from the flame that would become the Daystar's 
solar flames. Her rooms are furnished with wealth to bankrupt many princes, every need and want you might have catered to by the servile intelligence of the manse itself, her only desire to aid you. Even the essence of the manse adapts to make sure you are comfortable and every small detail aligns in your favor.
And beyond all that, you will find many, many rooms filled with magnificent workshops for every craft imaginable. Glassworking, pottery, smithing, painting, woodworking, jewelcrafting, and many more. The manse itself will aid you with any project you wish to take on within these halls, tools responding to your desires as eagerly as to your touch, and even gentle advice given on any of your handiwork if you wish for another opinion. Should you desire to, you may rearrange the flow of essence from the supporting manses to another manse than this one, but in reaction the palace shall become still, unable to help you as it wishes."
47,,400CP,Walls Containing Madness ,Dark Souls 2,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"This appears as a small castle with architecture of your choosing. The entirety of this structure's rooms and corridors appears dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge.
Scientific work stations with various tools and instruments appear in most rooms, chains from which to hang cages and other things hang from the ceiling, and the basement contains all manner of chests and cells where the scavenged and unwilling are stored.
Samples from captured and dissected creatures, among other beings, will be stocked within the basement, and replicated into the future for as many experiments as required. You must of course secure such valuable organs and parts yourself the first time, however."
48,,400CP,Wizard's Domain ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Having seen the writing on the wall or having stolen from someone who did, you have managed to isolate a small pocket of Ledgerdomain and constructed a defensible lair within it. This is a comfortable mansion with plenty of amenities, books on simple and advanced spells from this world, and conveniently generates any spell components you happen to need for your many spells and rituals. In addition, being in an isolated dimension made of magic greatly empowers your own spellcasting and makes it both easier to cast and just a bit more powerful. You may enter and leave this little pocket plane simply by thinking about it, a portal entering or leaving it appearing nearby."
49,,400CP,Working Unlimited Guns ,Fate/Grand Order - Part One,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A complete gunsmithing set made out of a strange black metal. There are tools here for every process of creation, from shaping the metal to the fine details of the gun itself. What makes this set special is several qualities. Firstly, any gun it creates will count as a magical creation and the user is able to copy spells or magic that they can use into the gun to transfer those effects onto the weapon itself, though how they manifest may change depending on the gun type. The forge is also able to easily convert other weapons or objects into guns of similar size, retaining all their normal properties but in firearm form."
50,,400CP,Workshop,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Going out and beating people up is not all there is to being a ninja, certainly not in the myriad worlds of Naruto fanfiction. There's a lot of space for less outdoorsy activities, such as seal-creation, weapons-forging, and so on. That's where this beautiful place comes in! It's the ultimate workshop, perfect for just about anything you may care to work at. It has a huge supply of papers and inks for your fuuinjutsu needs, herbs and plants for preparing poisons or medicines, a forge and metal supplies for smithing, timber for woodwork, and so on, for anything else you may care to work on. The quantities of the materials generated depend on their rarity and value. Something like ordinary paper and ink, or plain steel and wood, would never run out no matter how much you use, while things like paper from special, chakra-enriched trees would be in far shorter supply. But no matter how rare something might be, so long as it's not absolutely unique, you can expect to find it here, and in sufficient quantities to work with. At the absolute slowest, for materials of priceless rarity like high quality chakra-storing gemstones or metals, you could expect a supply to regenerate bi-yearly, and proportionately lesser times for less rare substances. In future worlds this workshop updates with materials and ingredients of the respective settings, with the same replenishment rules remaining in effect."
51,,500CP,Dwarven Forge ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"There is a place called Nidavellir. A place that has contained a dying neutron star, it was known for creating some of the most powerful weapons to exist in all of the Nine Realms. Forges were heated eternally from the heat of this star, strong enough to kill even the greatest of Asgardians were it not for one of the weapons forged in this very place. The mythical Uru springs from this place, metal that is used in the weapons of the gods. Such a place would cause untold prosperity or ruin depending on who held this place. Mayhaps the dwarves who controlled such a place realized the dangers of only having one, so there is a second structure that has been hidden away in the event Nidavellir was attacked. Maybe call it Myrkheim? Regardless, the heart of a dying star is yours to use in these mythical forges. Great works shall be created in these halls. Terrible, but great. Just don't get in the way of the focusing lens. It could kill you."
52,,500CP,Portable Geneforge Components ,Geneforge,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"This is most of what is needed to build a Geneforge of your own. However it is also very small in comparison to a full geneforge, using this you might be able to create a full geneforge that fits in the back of a wagon. Though it lacks the required information for how to get it to truly shape others, but you could find or produce most of that on your own."
53,,600CP,At The End of Time ,Divinity - Original Sin,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"The Sanctuary was once home to the pair of god-blessed humans who were appointed guardians over the box that kept darkness from this world. With no interference, they will soon rediscover it and slowly begin gaining access to the variety of rooms it houses. But due to a wrinkle in time, space, or perhaps simply in response to your own special nature, a copy of that magical space seems to have sprung into existence. Not a perfect copy with bound elementals and a Tapestry of Time, mind, but similar enough to service as a fine base in the space between worlds. The Second Sanctuary can be accessed through a small magical emerald in the shape of a pyramid. Tapping it will teleport you directly to the dining hall. Tapping it once inside will teleport you back to exactly where you were when you came in.
The Second Sanctuary will be surrounded on all sides by empty space, with stars sprinkling the blackness off in the far distance. This is merely an illusion as the rooms occupy a pocket dimension and are not actually situated in outer space. If you desire, you can set the view to that of appearing to float amidst a certain solar system you have already encountered. It contains two plush bedrooms, each with a queen-sized four-post bed, desk, a chair, several chests, and a wardrobe, everything crafted from wood and comfortable red fabrics. In addition there is a small dining hall set off to one side in the midst of a well-tended garden. The table will feed anyone who sits down at it with simple, but filling, food and drink.
The Second Sanctuary also comes equipped with a large, but currently empty, library and a workshop that includes a classic forge, tools and all. Don't be surprised to if you find a tall Elf wandering the library or relaxing at the feasting table. He dresses as loudly as a rainbow on several kinds of narcotics and is a little too friendly when it comes to invading personal space, but he's worth listening to. When he does stop by, his pockets, packs, and spaceship (How do you think he got here? Flapping his arms?) will be simply packed to the gills with magical weapons, enchanted armor, mysterious trinkets, and mystic essences brought with him from Rivellon proper. His stock tends to very wildly with each visit, but he'll usually have at least a few eye-catching artifacts. Who know what he might find in his travels through the multiverse? You might be surprised just what he can get his fingers on. Just don't expect him to sell anything for less than it's truly worth. He's too cunning for that. And yes, his name is Jack. How did you guess?"
54,,600CP,Caern ,World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A caern is a natural upwelling of spiritual energy. Werewolves and fera treasure and protect them as holy sites and places to renew their spiritual ties and gather for various rituals. Unlike normal caerns that can be exhausted or fade without ritual support, yours will never fade and has a regenerating supply of spiritual energy and magic. You may freely allow or bar people from using the energy the caern provides to refill their gnosis pool. Normally the garou nation would make a rather large stink about a couple of low rank werewolves owning a caern, but the property it sits on is legally yours via inheritance, hook or crook, or outright buying it from some human that didn't know any better. Drop Ins that purchase this find a deed in their warehouse. It comes with ten acres of forest, but you may import another property to get the benefits. For an extra 100 points the forest increases to 100 acres, becomes tax free, and becomes immune to attempts to buy it or steal it via shenanigans legal shenanigans."
55,,600CP,Cosmic Anvil ,DC - All-Star Superman,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A gift from New Olympus delivered straight to your doorstep, Jumper!
This anvil and hammer are capable of smashing atoms together to form miniature suns, and with a bit of work, even miniature planets. Potentially, you could make them even bigger, or even 'life-sized'...though this will take weeks or even months of work and it's recommended to do so somewhere within space."
56,,600CP,Enchanter's Forge ,Nexus 2.0,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A rare thing in Nexus, the Enchanter's Forges are the result of a magical catastrophe well before recorded history, considered myths by most people to this day. An Enchanter's Forge is actually a chaotic collection of magics and Mist in a small pocket dimension that will bind itself to an individual that claims it. The power held within this collection of magics is potent and may be worked as if it were a material substance, though it must be anchored to a physical medium to be of actual use, effectively tying the resulting magics to an object. This creates an enchantment that can potentially carry a wide variety of effects.
Working the magic within an Enchanter's Forge is exceptionally difficult, requiring a lifetime of work to master the process and gain the potential to create truly powerful enchantments. Until then, you can only really give minor ones such as an enchantment for a blade to drink in blood to repair itself or creating a bow that produces its own arrows. Actually making enchantments with the Enchanter's Forge takes a great deal of time, requiring a heavy investment in time to actually create any powerful enchantments. Even then, you must experiment and practice with it to garner any results, no two Enchanter's Forges are the same, meaning you cannot rely on the experiences of others to guide your own use. The power within an Enchanter's Forge never seems to run out, and it is a great source of magical power if you possess some other way to utilize it"

It has the most extensive library, the largest collection of artifacts, the most members, and the most overall resources. It also hosts the Hall of Ages and the (currently empty) throne of the pharaoh. Now you can bring it with you, importing it into each new setting. As a bonus, the Nome's membership will include magicians from past and future worlds you've visited, its library will include books of other magic systems, and its vaults will include artifacts from the same. The Hall of Ages will detail the history of whatever world it is currently in, with side corridors providing less detailed accounts of former worlds."

The island is heavily magically warded and protected and you don't need to worry about people on the ground noticing it, and there is a teleport pad that can take you down to the surface. You can teleport back, alongside anyone you give permission, to the island from any place in the world you're currently in. Your island comes with its own gynoid that oversees it and makes sure it's operating smoothly. They're quirky but friendly and completely loyal to you. This flying island can mimic any of the ones that Regina Babylon herself made or, for 600 CP total (300 discounted) you can have a completed island with all 9 facilities once again combined together, alongside nine gynoids to look after it. If the facilities or gynoids are destroyed they'll show up a week later good as new. The gynoids aren't companions unless you import them as such later on. Alternatively, there is an option in the Companion section that has them start as companions, which you can read the details of in that section."
59,,600CP,Forge and Ore ,Silmarillion,Domain: Facilities: Magical,The Dwarves are known for their crafting above all things. To craft the proper equipment takes a fine forge and proper raw materials. You now have your own forge fully equipped for forging any item of metal. Attached to the grand forge is a cave filled with much of the most common ores and even a bit of mithril. In future jumps ores of materials in that setting will begin to appear deeper in the cave. The rarer the metal the less of it there will be. The forge and cave may be attached to your warehouse or another property you own.
60,,600CP,Goblin Forge ,Hellboy,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"A replica of the forge used by the nameless goblin smith who forged the Golden Army. The forge is magical, and can do much of the work in the forging process by itself, only needing your input for the first designs before becoming capable of churning out an army- or the weapons to equip them- in a much shorter amount of time than would be thought possible. The items forged by it are all but indestructible, and will last for millenniums without needing repair or upkeep. It will be up to you to provide any resources needed for their crafting, however, but any enchantments you choose to apply will be applied evenly to every craft you wish it to be, so long as you can supply it in the creation of the first one. Can become a Warehouse attachment Post-Jump."
61,,600CP,Gushimera Laboratory ,God Catching Alchemy Meister,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"This research facility used to belong to powerful mages before they were overrun by demons. Some of the knowledge was lost as the demons made their home there, but after a while they just went away and this precious fountain of knowledge came into your hands. The facility was geared towards the creation of golems, artificial Mana Spirits and even has notes about creating homunculus. It's still somewhat operational and full of information waiting to be discovered. It will become a warehouse attachment post-jump."
62,,600CP,Khorne's Anvil ,Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"This massive anvil is a one of a kind gift from the Master of Murder, completely engraved with the markings of Khorne. It will seem like it is otherwise unassuming until you begin creating weapons on it. Weapons that are hammered into shape in this anvil will be of masterwork quality regardless of the metals used, and they are eternally sharp and will never wear and tear. But this is not the greatest gift of the anvil. Khorne is willing to use the souls of magic users who are sacrificed on the anvil to grant a weapon a magic effect that reflects the magical strength of the mage that was sacrificed on it...with no limits. This may seem hypocritical for Khorne, but Khorne believes that magic weapons made from a subjugated mage is perhaps the greatest example of might over magic, and the weapon's existence confirms his ideals."
63,,600CP,Lab Space ,Asterix the Gaul,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Be a Roman engineer or a Gaulish druid, both need a space that's completely theirs, so that they can work in peace. This is the one for you. Filled with the absolute latest in instruments and tools, and with a truly staggering variety of parts and materials, it's basically the perfect workshop. You even find your mind working sharper here, allowing you to innovate at a slightly increased speed than normal. In every following jump, this updates with the absolute cutting edge of all the tools, materials and substances required for the pursuit of both science and magic, enough for you to come up with true wonders no matter where you end up. Again, this doesn't stock one of a kind materials that you would normally require a month long quest to get. Rather, if it's available in a shop anywhere in the world, a mortal shop, you will find it here"
64,,600CP,Magic Research Facility ,The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Fourth Time,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Magic and science. Alone they are great, together and in the right hands they are all powerful. The sleekness of a laboratory at the cutting edge of science, housing the greatest tools, magical and otherwise. A great thing that has come into your possession. Either inserted somewhere in the world itself, lodged away in your warehouse, or attached to some property you already having following you around, is a high-tech facility on par with, or perhaps slightly above, that which the eponymous Vandalieu had been trapped and tortured within during his time in Origin. Its tools are specially made to analyze and interact with magic, and as such it is the perfect home for magical experiments of all kinds. Whether it be dissecting or containing monsters, trying out brand new spells, or even processing and mass producing magical materials and even magic items, this facility is perfectly made for all of it. Of possibly greatest use to those with great stores of magic is the spell testing room, however, as this room is perfectly suited for testing out and analyzing even the most powerful of spells, localizing its effects and preventing even the most powerful of them from affecting anything outside of them."
65,,600CP,Rogue Nome ,Kane Chronicles,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Apparently you weren't alone when you broke with the House of Life. You brought two or so a dozen friends with you, all nearly as skilled in Egyptian magic as you are. You collectively occupy a mansion that is either magically hidden from mortals or situated in the Duat - the difference can be negligible at times. It is defended by powerful spells, well supplied in terms of both mundane and magical resources, and has a library filled with scrolls and books on magic and the gods. The magicians here do not count as companions, and the Nome can either be imported into later settings or made into a warehouse attachment."

This forge and the mold for Mjolnir was stolen and used by Loki to make a legion of brother hammers to Mjolnir during the final Ragnarok. This mould and the lesser hammers were - or perhaps will be - destroyed by Thor and channeled into an attack. But now you have come into possession of something similar. This forge, which takes the form of a special room connected to your warehouse, contains within it the heart of a dying star. This is, of course, a powerful tool, but most beings would be unable to use it directly without suffering near instant death. You are not most beings and I have the utmost confidence that you will think of something."
67,,600CP,The Dragons Cradle ,Exalted - The Dragonbloods,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"In areas where there are powerful intersections of the essence of creation, places of magical potency can be found. The concentration of essence twists and warps the surrounding area into a Demense. However cunning architects and sorcerers can tap into this power, and construct structures on these ley lines to harness the power towards their own ends. These structures are known as Manses, and they are valuable resources to those that hold them. Thanks to the approval of your benefactor, we have been authorized to construct a place of power which can be attached to your warehouse, whatever that is.
This manse will take the form of a luscious two story manor, with the in depth specifications up to you, with its elemental affinity matching yours. However what we can guarantee is a fully stocked library where you will likely find all manner of useful tomes, one of the most advanced workshops we can create to ensure you have somewhere to ply your crafts, a full set of bound servants to maintain the property, and a considerable allotment space. From the inherent power present in the manse you will find it much easier to grasp the secrets of essence, as it is a font of gaian magics; as well as any children you may have here bearing the dragon's blood will find it far more likely to exalt in the future, thanks to the potent elemental essence empowering all of its residents.
Oh and one final feature we should add, is that it also generates a Hearthstone. This jewel, roughly the size of a chicken's egg, can either aid in your ability to recover essence through proximity or be used to power any magitech you may possess. Should you take it into the world and plant it in the ground, within one hour your manse will sprout from the ground fully formed. Although while you can retrieve the hearthstone afterwards be aware this can only be done once every ten years."
68,,600CP,The Underhaus ,Exalted - The Abyssals,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Your very own Underworld. Or at least, a slice of Underworld for yourself. For 200 cp, this adds an Underworld layer to your cosmic warehouse, taking on the appearance of a dark reflection of your existing warehouse, seen through the lens of death. Located ""below"" your warehouse in the same way that the greater Underworld is below the living world of Creation, you may designate parts of your warehouse to be small, enduring shadowlands to access this Underhaus more easily. Here you may respire necrotic essence, interact with ghosts and immaterial spirits, and store things that cannot bear the light of the sun.
Alternatively, if that isn't enough, you may pay a full 600 cp and get something much more expansive. Instead of merely receiving a dark mirror of your warehouse, each of the various attachments, properties, and lands that follow you will have underworld reflections of their own. These properties shall sit as anchors within the world and each of your properties, in whole or in part, may be made into shadowlands to lead down into this greater Underhaus. Connecting all of these disjointed underworld landmarks will be an underworld appropriate to the world they stand in, a dark world that gains solidity and detail from the memories of the dead. Where none have lived or died, the terrain is grey and nearly featureless phantasms. But where many people have lived their lives and breathed their last, this underworld is filled with dark reflections and remnants of what has been lost. Primeval forests that have since been cut down and burnt for farmland, the remnants of cities lost to war and villages lost to plague, and whatever else has been lost to the sands of time in the world you find yourself in. The population of this underworld, aside from any followers you bring with you, would be composed merely of plasmic creatures and echoes of the dead, not true ghosts of the natives. However, once established below a world, the dead of that place may choose to resist the call of whatever fate would normally remain for them past death, to linger within the Underhaus as ghosts.
* Gives all the workshops and lands a underworld layer to craft with plus some other stuff"
69,,600CP,Wizard's Tower ,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Avalon is the land of the fairies, an almost unreachable realm that has only seen a handful of human, partially or fully, visitors in all of time. Within Avalon, there can be found smaller realms, such as the one that Merlin will eventually come to be imprisoned within. The realm you find yourself with access to is similar to that realm but does not imprison you. This place, a small dimension measuring a few miles across, is filled with a field of gorgeous flowers. In the centre of the dimension is a tall wizard's tower. There are many rooms, workshops and laboratories within this tower, filled with extremely rare materials, resources, reagents and magical curios, as well as a fair few creature comforts and luxuries. Many of these resources will replenish in time too. There are even a great deal of books written on various magical subjects, some by Merlin himself and some by those much older than even him. You may enter this realm with just a thought, through all but the most powerful and thorough of preventions against dimensional travel, and exit out into any location without those most powerful protections. While others can potentially invade your dimension should they find out about it, the tower realm has protections against invasion on a similar level to the sheath Avalon does when activated."
70,,600CP,World Hacking ,A Super Mario Thing,Domain: Facilities: Magical,"Toads are the primary builders in the Mario universe – more than you would think. In fact, they help to create new worlds and levels by tampering with the reality and moving land segments and other things about; they don’t always get things right, which explains why everything is so wacky. With this perk, you can safely use various methods, whether through your own powers or mechanical lifting, to safely remove chunks of land and transport them to new locations. The inserted pieces will fit into the new level without the shattering, earthquakes, and other effects that normal people are used to. Furthermore, the various chunks can touch each other without damaging each other, such that you can even transplant icebergs onto lava fields or vice versa without problems ensuing. On the other hand, you’ll have to practice to figure out how to get the different pieces to align with each other, or else you’ll get a jumbled mess of a level. Still, with enough work you can create your own unique, Super Mario Bros.-style levels and worlds for people to explore."
