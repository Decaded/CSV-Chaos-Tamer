0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,0CP,Pure Art ,Destiny - Old,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"The visual arts may not be your thing, but that doesn't mean you can't be good at it. With this, you will be able to adorn any object you possess with paint or some other kind of marker and make it look good. You can paint armor, vehicles and weapons. Depending on what you portray, it could evoke different emotions. From fear to inspiration. You must have some skill at drawing or painting, and something to draw or paint with."
2,,0CP,Transmogrification ,World of Warcraft,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"Have a set of armor that you like? Yet you like another set of armor's stats? Well don't fret! Transmog machine is here! What is it? It looks like a giant washing machine, you can feed any two sets of armor (Head, Chest, Legs, Boots, & Gloves) and choose which one is spit out. The new armor will be the best of both worlds. It'll have the superior stats of the one item, and looks of the other. However the downside is that the other item is destroyed. However both items are in a database so you can always transmog the look. Don't bother taking it apart and trying to figure out how it works, because there's no answer. It just works."
3,,50CP,My Fashion Sense is Tingling ,The World Ends With You,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"You have an impeccable sense of fashion. You can make an appealing outfit out of just about anything. In addition, you will always have an innate knowledge of what is fashionable in the area wherever you go, allowing you to remain on top of your game no matter where you are. In fact, you'll usually be a trendsetter."
4,,50CP,Pegasus Aesthetics ,Stargate Atlantis,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"At any time you can apply or remove an ""Ancient"", ""Atlantis"" or ""Wraith'' aesthetic to your chosen possessions and properties. The Ancient aesthetic is clean white tones with motifs cut at clean angles while the Atlantis aesthetic is blue and ochre walls and floors, clear pipes of bubbling water, with hexagonal motifs; both offer crystal-like fixture controls and flush light fittings. The Wraith aesthetic is dark biotech, dim blue lighting, webbing, and a low mist; this can be actual Hive biotech if you want, but such only replaces the framework and facade."
5,,100CP,Aesthetics ,Anno 2070,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"Others may be able to do what you do, but you? You make it look GOOD. Really, REALLY good. All buildings you construct now have a distinctive architectural flair that marks them as yours and yours alone. Even a simple wooden shack you build will have people nodding matter-of-factly and recognizing the design like a nation's flag, if they've had experience with you before. In addition, purely aesthetic construction - landscaped bays, parks, covered walkways, promenades - are not only cheaper to build, but require little to no upkeep."
6,,100CP,Aesthetics ,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"It's not enough to just be able to make things, if you can't make them look good. You now have a true talent for design work and layout, capable of mentally visualizing complex structures and working out how best to match your mental vision, without sacrificing things like structural integrity. This also applies when making things on a smaller scale, allowing you to alter the design of objects to add aesthetic flare without compromising their function."
7,,100CP,Aesthetics and Flair | Inexplicable Innuendo | Classy Contortionist | Small Beginnings,Bayonetta,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"A gun isn't quite a gun until it LOOKS good, you know? It's supposed to be classy, make you look amazing just for having it. Likewise, that sword could use a bit of badass styling to it. When you create your weapons, you can make them look DAMNED good even on an off day. Expect any weapon creator to envy you, and those who die by your weapons to count themselves lucky as they perish to such beautiful art.
Inexplicable Innuendo (0CP) You're not sure how, but just by being here you've gotten the jive of things. Any time you want to come off as sexy or just talk in a lightheartedly dirty manner, it's easy as pie for you. Want to make some people squirm with an implication? Done. You can even implement this in your battle quips, throwing them off their game for that moment of distraction you need.
Classy Contortionist (0CP) Um... this is something. You've got an innate sense of posing that you can utilize, whether it be to show off your sexiness or simply throw people off their game. It's got all kinds of applications, and no matter what you're always going to look good. Throw it into your battle styles or something.
Small Beginnings (0CP) Maybe you didn't have a weapon starting out, or you just want to start something new. There's a nice feeling to trying to start a legend, after all, to go into the world with a unique weapon all your own. You start with a single melee or ranged weapon, to be used in the Weapon Customization Table"
8,,100CP,Artiste ,Girl Genius SB,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"From acting to painting, there's a lot of call for people like you around here! Simply put, you have the skills and talent to be one of the greatest, finest artists of all time. Not just in any one field either. Your talent is boundless and unbelievable at everything remotely art-related you do. With the slightest effort, you could be a scintillating star in all fields from writing, painting, singing, underwater basket weaving... er, you get the idea. Crowds throng to listen to a concerto from you, and books you write may well cause knife fights between people wanting to buy them!
Such is your talent that in but a handful of months you could become a celebrity every bit the equal of the Queen of the Dawn, or any other celebrity you've heard of. This also makes anything you do look unbelievably good, from your fighting which looks like a dance, to your clanks which all look like Things of Beauty and Grace even when stuffed chock-full of firepower."
9,,100CP,Artistic License ,Everyone Else Is A Returnee,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"You know what a gun or spear made from the body parts of a strange monster looks like? Not that great, more often than not. Luckily now you are able to make things that you create look really cool, almost like they were made from something else entirely. No matter what materials you use, you can somehow manage to make it look good. Alternatively, maybe you want to make a simple steel sword look menacing or unnatural."
10,,100CP,Artistic Architect ,Halo - Forerunner Saga,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"Forerunner structures are not simple. Even in the worst of times, there is a beauty to their layout. Patterns woven into walls, shining pillars reaching to the sky, and shimmering glass panes adjourning corridors. Forerunners don't just build big. They build artfully. Like so many other Builders, you have an eye, and a hand, for beauty in construction. From the most simple of floors, to the most terrifying of weapons, you can spruce them up so that they are breathtaking to behold."
11,,100CP,Bling of War ,Macross,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"It's one thing to have a weapon or vehicle of mass destruction, capable of rending an entire ground force or a squadron to shame. It's another to make it look so damn good your enemies would not dare get near it if they had a lick of sense. By purchasing this perk, you can design your equipment to look much more stylish and carry a 'theme' you prefer. This can range from the clothes you wear, to the weapons you wield, to even the vehicles you pilot into battle. It's all about style"
12,,100CP,Brass and Vacuum Tubes ,Smash Up,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"You can make perfectly functional devices with a steampunk aesthetic. In fact, machines you build like this tend to work a little better, and stand up to far more abuse."
13,,100CP,Decadence ,Dune,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"You have the skills to sacrifice neither form nor function when you design, create, or arrange things, which is especially important in a society whose upper crust values opulence the way this society does --after all, the Emperor's throne is carved out of a single massive gemstone. Whether it's interior decorating, crafting a knife or sword, building furniture or a vehicle... you can make it appeal perfectly to the most crass or the upper crust. You can also figure out the optimal decor for any purpose or environment, which includes the best places to hide discreet surveillance devices"
14,,100CP,Form and Function ,The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"While some scientists have to choose one or the other, you can have both; it's not only easy for you to make your works look great, but you can do so in a way where you don't use more materials than you would normally."
15,,100CP,Grand Aurora ,Battle Through The Heavens,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"When a treasure is born into the world, the world tends to recognise this. Special phenomena are known to occur when some particularly monumentous is created. For instance the creation of a tier 8 pill, or Tian rank Qi technique will be marked by a large unnatural phenomenon. When you complete the formation of something significant and powerful, the world recognises this. For kilometers around, people will be able to see an aurora or pillar of light and will know intuitively that something grand has been created. This can be toggled on and off as you wish."
16,,100CP,Heart's Desire ,Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"All Necrotects are skilled architects and designers. They wouldn't have the job if they weren't and you're no different. You're gifted with any sort of architecture, trap making or monument designing. What makes you special is that you have a sense for what your customers really want. You can picture in your mind the exact ideal of the thing they're hiring you to build and create it. Closer than any instructions could communicate to you, you understand their wish and you know what it should look like, though the construction of such a thing may yet be beyond your means. Still, if you can carry it out, they'll love you for it, even if it differs from the instructions they said to you."
17,,100CP,Her Majesty's Majesty ,Fate/Legends - Empire of Antiquity,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"They say that every hero of these times was a marvel to look upon. The statues that remain from these years in modern times would seem to give that impression and should you eventually have one made of you, it won't fall short. Whether it's being beautiful or handsome, you stand out like a shining jewel even among heroes. Many can't help but gasp once they see your visage and it'll smooth out plenty of problems for you, not the least is finding a suitable partner. Your beauty will also affect the things that you make and rule over, even something as large as Rome itself, but this effect slowly takes hold over time. While a sword you wield may slowly become more ornate and fine over days of use, an empire might need years to be fully affected, but it and all it's people will be shining by the end. You can have this stop at a certain level if you like, whether that's to keep some parts of your empire ugly or just to stop everyone from maybe becoming self-obsessed snobs that never stop looking in mirrors."
18,,100CP,Stylish Mechanic ,Gurren Lagann,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"In addition to knowing how to repair and create mechanical devices you also have quite a knack at making anything you work on look good. Any time you fix something it'll end up clean and pleasant to look at, and you can easily come up with humorous or awe-inspiring designs for vehicles and devices."
19,,100CP,Tailor Made | Jet Set Schedule ,Career Model,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"Tailor Made (100CP) You are a brilliant designer and can ensure objects you create are always looking fantastic, aesthetically pleasing and the like. Making something look good no longer takes any time or effort- you can focus entirely on function, and whatever you make will look outstanding
Jet Set Schedule (0CP) The life in the industry is a furious, fast paced one, and it waits for nobody. This perk ensures you won’t suffer any issues no matter how hectic your schedule gets. You’ll never get jet lag, and you can sleep whenever or wherever but you still need as much sleep as your body requires. If you’re still tired, you’ll never show it, always being bright eyed and fresh for your friends or the cameras."
20,,100CP,The Very Model of a Modern Major Mod ,Modded Skyrim,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"Why make something at all if it's not going to be the very best? Anything you can make, you can make breathtakingly beautiful. Whether it's a castle, a person, or even entire worlds, should you be capable of that, it will fully live up to your aesthetic expectations. What's more, you get a bit more leeway with what you can get away with before you start to have problems. That upside down pyramid can be made structurally sound, no problem."
21,,100CP,Top of the Class ,Inception,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"As an architect, your job is first and foremost to design. From ordinary buildings to the dreamlands visited during extraction jobs, you're a master at coming up with aesthetically pleasing environments. Even better, you're especially gifted at making the most of any unique opportunities, like improving the feel of a city when 'down' can just as easily become 'up'."
22,,100CP,Virtuoso ,World of Darkness - Demon the Fallen,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"There is nothing sexier than an artist. Music, painting, singing, you are a veritable virtuoso when you put your mind and faith into your work. Your emotions flow into musical pieces in ways that incite that same emotion in those that hear it. Those that look upon your art understand the deeper meanings of it almost instinctually, but it might always feel as if there is something they just can't grasp about it, something more. In some way, they can feel your divine touch by just experiencing your art."
23,,200CP,(Not so) Consistent Technology,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"The average Genius has an Aesthetic that they fit into, kind of like a genre of legacy. You however, thanks to your many teachers, have a difference of opinion that makes you unique, Wonders built in your Aesthetic don't just 'feel' better but are better and you can switch your Aesthetic when you feel like a different Tech-Genre could be viable. You could have an airship that was built with the hard bulky like of a dieselpunk whilst the insides have the sleek holograms and AR of a cyberpunk."
24,,200CP,ABXY ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"For console games, one of the most important pieces to playing a game is the controller. It needs to fit a player's hands, it needs to have a simple button layout, and it needs to be fun to use. And you can build them without a problem. Controllers you make will more often than not be intuitive to use and have a one-size-fits-most grip that makes it not only easy to hold, but altogether enjoyable to use when playing video games. This will even extend into more advanced variations of the stock controller, allowing you to create specially made variations that offer more options for players or are fitted to make specific games easier to play."
25,,200CP,Accessory Machine ,Spiral Knights,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"It is one thing to go out into the world and do a Knight's duty, but it is another to look the part. This machine is special, allowing you to create cosmetic pieces or effects and bind them to your equipment to improve their appearance, though this requires resources. Nothing really comes free, after all. Armor pieces, auras, or even cosmetic wings... go ahead. Express yourself. Let your creativity flow."
26,,200CP,Beauty in the Arts ,God of War,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"The Greeks and their gods have an eye for the aesthetics of their surroundings. Whether it is the statues around them, or the floors they walk upon, or the things they carry and wield, it is better if it is appealing. Your ability to design any of your crafts has increased with this knowledge, able to appeal to form without sacrificing function. Regardless of what you create, it's going to look good enough that the gods might take notice... might. Whether this is a good thing, or a bad thing is for you to decide."
27,,200CP,Cannith Contemporary ,D&D Eberron,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"House Cannith controls the crafting, but they aren't the only crafters out there. Thanks either to your raw skill or to skilled networking, you gain connections and reputation with other crafters much faster, and can add fancy and unusual flairs to anything you make."
28,,200CP,Devilish Details ,Dungeon Keeper,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"While dark and dank may suffice for the common rabble, great Keepers require suitably grandiose lodgings to show off their wealth and power. Make doing so easier by acquiring the ability to slowly alter any property you own to better reflect your personality. Watch colors slowly shift to match your preference and fixtures become personalized in shape and form. The effect is only skin deep, so while a poorly constructed home may look impressive, it's still as rotten on the inside as its owner."
29,,200CP,From Q With Love ,Smash Up,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"Taser in the keyfob, laser in the watch, grappling hook pistol that looks like a cellphone? You are the undisputed master at disguising weapons and espionage gear as ordinary items. Just try not to get them confused with the real thing, and do bring the car back in pristine condition."
30,,200CP,Perfected Calligraphy ,Exalted - The Infernals,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"Elloge is a writer and storyteller without peer, ever creating within herself new vortices of vocalization and tangles of text. Her inner worlds reflecting manifold different tales and countless chapters of her own narratives. The deepest parts of her have little to do with reality as it is or ever was, idealized paradises and grand dramas unfolding in realms that resemble Creation, Malfeas, lost Zen-Mu, or any number of other, fictional worlds. So too may you craft elaborate narratives and uniquely beautiful stories, ever writing with the zeal of inspiration, and muse-born linguistics that would stand out even in the countless annals and libraries of Hell. From now on, you shall live and breathe the ingenuity of a talecrafter without peer. Appropriately to the wondrous correspondences you shall write, you will also gain the calligraphic skill to write with neat flowing script or ornate glyphs in all the numberless languages of the Sphere of Speech."
31,,300CP,Artisan of the Supreme Holy Heavens ,Against the Gods!,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"While a huge part of everything, cultivation is not all there is to life. There are things to enjoy too, such as arts and beauty. This perk gives you exemplary, extreme talent for arts of all kind. Anything you do, you can do unbelievably beautifully and artistically.
And those words really do mean just that. A casual scribble from your fingers would have people paying absurd sums in auctions for it, singing a couple notes could inflame a whole new musical movement worldwide, and something you put actual effort into could drive people into rapturous adoration simply by encountering it. This works in every field of art, from writing to drawing to singing and dancing, and you can even train it to further improve things."
32,,600CP,Ancient But High Tech ,Cities of the World,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"You are an expert in making advanced technology out of lower tech items, and of integrating technology seamlessly into society. Technologies you introduce will be less disruptive and be adopted easier, and are harder to replicate. Not only that, but you've become a virtual genius in making technological items look like nothing of the kind. Scanners that look like mirrors, tables that are computers, stone idols that are forcefield generators. Of course, this makes you extremely good at spotting when others have done exactly the same thing and working out how such devices operate.
As a city, your people are well versed in such integration of form and function, able to seem quaint and harmless while being nothing of the kind. People will constantly underestimate your people as being uneducated hicks and rubes who can't possibly be advanced as modern folks... though this effect isn't enforced and if you show it to be wrong too often, more intelligent people will learn otherwise. Any area under your influence will accept new technology and innovations extremely rapidly and with a minimum of fuss."
33,,600CP,Bring it to Life ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"Your art is transcendent in more ways than one. Any artistic design that you make is like a story of its own, each drawing worth a thousand words and every expression displaying the exact emotion you intended. Your ability is such that you can make drawings that could be mistaken for photographs, even when inspected by experts, and any animation you make is smooth, aesthetically pleasing, and looks natural. Nearly anything you make, even those drawn on a napkin in just under a minute, are so awe inspiring that that napkin drawing could inspire an entire franchise if shown to the right people."
34,,600CP,Legendary Master: Artistic ,Rimworld,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"You're an expert at expressing the inner beauty of any medium. It is mere childsplay to make anything you manufacture fit an aesthetic theme, regardless of function. Any dedicated statues, paintings, sketches etc. you make are vastly improved in quality, regardless of what you actual used or created. A water-colour paint-by-numbers on old parchment showing a gerbil giving birth would still possess beauty if filled by you. Also allows you to find a market for your artwork in any setting, allowing you decent income based upon quality of work. If there exists no parties to purchase such things, I'll buy them. Put them right up on my cosmic fridge."
35,,600CP,Lucid Logo Designer ,City of Angles,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"Design, iterate, redesign. Undo. A different approach. When it comes to graphic design, you certainly have an eye for aesthetic that can't be beat. But your best work is done without a specific goal in mind, idle adjustments to a logo intended for nothing in particular. As time passes, you'll note that it starts to look less and less like a logo at all. And indeed, it isn't. What you are pulling from the depths of your subconscious and laying on the page is a map, an ever-growing and ever-more-detailed guide to the structure of reality itself, no matter how odd that reality might be. In time, you could put the entirety of the City of Angles to paper."
36,,800CP,Mural Inspiration | The Yellow Sign ,City of Angles,Domain: Quality: Appearance,"Mural Inspiration (200CP) Graffiti is an oft-maligned craft, a generally illegal one at that. And sure, the lawmakers have their reasons, but you're not some lamer throwing up tags on the bathroom walls. No, your art has a message. What message? Well, that's up to you. Regardless, when people see your art, or your icon, or your words scrawled on public facades, that message will shine through loud and clear. And if they're amenable to the message, who knows? Maybe it will inspire them to action, to go above and beyond.
The Yellow Sign (600CP) Now this is a trick with a rather more...specific meaning. Not to mention a lot more vitriol. Normal graffiti is the stylization of words, to make sure the right people can read it. This is the opposite: a single word, filled with love for those you care about, and hatred for those who would do them harm, carefully constructed so that only the latter group can comprehend it. When they do, the message encoded within takes its love and its hatred, and forms a spike of righteous fury that slams through their cerebral cortex. In a single moment, excuses, justifications, and rationalizations for their misdeeds are stripped away. Depending on just how many misdeeds they've committed, they might be given pause, reel in horror, or even break entirely under the weight of their past actions."
