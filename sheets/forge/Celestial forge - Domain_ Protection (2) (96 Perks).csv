0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,50CP,Summer Fashion ,Fate/Whore Order,Domain: Protection,"While a not insignificant portion of Scathach’s efforts take place in Shinjuku, the city of Yakuza, a larger 
portion takes place in Luluhawa and Vegas, two of the four summer Singularities. It should come as no 
surprise then that this allowed Scathatch to dress both herself and others in even more risque clothing 
than they would normally wear. In other words, swimsuits. And boy, were they swimming in men and 
sperm right quick. The way this perk affects that is that it takes that otherwise weak piece of fabric and 
grants it the Servant class durability it will need to not get utterly destroyed, be it from swords and 
lances or over eager men trying to rip it off. This also applies to lingerie and other naughty things, but 
not to actual clothes. It also prevents them from staining due to all the fluids. "
2,,100CP,A Bottomless Heart ,Generic Hentai World,Domain: Protection,"For an ordinary person it may be enough to only have one other person to spend your life with, but 
there’s nothing ordinary about you, is there? Love and emotional attachment comes to you easily and 
you find it more difficult than most to let go of those you care about, to the point that choosing one 
woman over another when you love them both is unthinkable to you. Luckily, this is not without its 
benefits. You have a perfect photographic memory for information about people you care about, no 
matter how many of those people you might have. You’ll never forget their birthdays, favorite meals, 
erogenous zones, etc. and can easily keep track of their needs and desires without even thinking very 
hard about it."
3,,100CP,Ageless II ,Essential Body Modification Supplement,Domain: Protection,"You do not age or otherwise degenerate over time in the normal manner, You will never die of old age and will maintain peak performance and health with no degeneration forever. You may choose to halt or resume your visible aging at any time."
4,,100CP,Eureka!,Generic Lewd Sci-Fi,Domain: Protection,"It’s a little worrying just how many scientific advancements came from accidents and a scary lack of safety standards. Luckily for you, while you aren’t any less or more accident prone than normal, such accidents tend to be on the sexy side of things. Less “melt everyone’s face off” and more “melt everyone’s clothes off”, or being bitten by a radioactive pig wouldn’t turn you into a half-porcine monsterbut bestow on you their ability to have 30 minute orgasms, until it wore off."
5,,100CP,It Has Needs ,World of Tentacles,Domain: Protection,"A genius’s mind is as deviant as it is brilliant, and the products of that genius trend towards the deviant as well. By including erotic elements in the creation of your items or monsters, such as summoning a demon with a tantric ritual or powering a device with the energy of Orgasmic Extraction, the creation process becomes much easier at the cost of making the result more dependent on those elements. So long as you keep such needs sated your creations will be distinctly more powerful and easier to control, but the opposite is true if their needs are not fulfilled."
6,,100CP,Love at First Sight ,Generic Hentai World,Domain: Protection,"It’s said that every journey begins with a first step, and whether that step is a good one or not can set 
the tone for the whole trip. This is no less true for relationships than for anything else. Luckily, you have 
a gift for starting things off on the right foot: whether you’re starting a new job or making new friends or 
meeting a destined lover for the first time, everything just seems to go exactly the way you need it to in 
order to make a good first impression on people. You’ll never fumble your words or trip over your own 
shoelaces ever again (unless you meant for that to happen, some girls are into cute clumsy dorky guys 
after all)... at least, not at first. After step one it’s all on you to maintain that positive impression."
7,,100CP,BLACKBODY ANOMALY ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Protection,"As an Excession, it's important to keep your secrets. Scans and sensor readings that try to gather 
information from past the skin of your body give either nothing, infinity or extremely contradictory and 
impossible readings. You may disable or enable this effect at will."
8,,100CP,Corruption Resistance ,Essential Body Modification Supplement,Domain: Protection,"This perk confers protection against supernatural influences that target your soul or that fall outside the 
bounds of physical or mental influence. Unless you specifically wish for it to do so, no contract, curse, 
possession, or effect can take hold of, bind, or damage your soul or being. When you first gain this perk, 
your soul is restored to an uncorrupted, whole state and any supernatural influences are cast off."
9,,100CP,Murphy's Law ,SCP Foundation,Domain: Protection,"You've been around so many experiments, so much weird shit, that you notice things other people don't 
and instinctively position yourself, as a subconscious reaction to anything that can go wrong, and avoid 
the eventual backfire. The knowledge that a few errant bubbles in a flask can quickly turn into boiling so 
violently that even the open end of it isn't enough to let all of its energy out, turning it into a chemical 
explosive, is not lost on you. Neither is the fact that that open flask over there just bubbled when a piece
of dust fell into it. If you're running the experiments, you know how to avoid those circumstances, and how to extinguish the fires if and when they break out."
10,,100CP,Painted On ,Generic Lewd Sci-Fi,Domain: Protection,"Clothing just seems to fit so much better when you wear it. You can decide how tight the fit of your 
clothing is, as well as reduce the thickness or thinness of the fabric. This lets you decide how supportive 
the clothing is, too, as well as whether it’s sheer or not. This doesn’t change the clothing’s other 
features, like its style or colors, or what kind of functions or protection it provides."
11,,100CP,Protection ,Milk Hunters,Domain: Protection,"With Senpai going around and raping anyone who catches his eye during monster attacks, it might be a 
good idea to have a bit of “protection.” Protection against STDs and unwanted pregnancies, that is. From 
now on, you can choose whether or not you will get pregnant or impregnate someone during sex, and 
you’re not only immune to STDs, but you’ll cure any that your partners have. Unless you don’t want to, for some reason."
12,,100CP,Parasite's Compromise ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Protection,"It's so cruel to hate a parasite, it just wants to live like any other living thing. It's just that its survival 
instincts tend to create conflict with its host. However, you know how to make the experience mutually 
beneficial. If you are infected with a parasite, you can merge with the parasite and take control of it, thus
preventing it from harming you; in fact, the parasite, having merged with you, will now often be 
beneficial for your body, covering defences that your body alone could not handle. You will essentially be
sharing the same mind and memory (with you in charge), and since the host (you) is now bonded with 
the parasite, there will be no further conflict over living space or control. On the flipside, if you are in the
form of a parasite and have infected a living host, you can, by gaining consent from the host or by 
overpowering the host's will, merge with the host, you becoming the host and the host becoming the 
parasite. Either way, parasite or host, you remain the dominant one in the bond. If you wish to break off 
the merge on either end of the spectrum, you can separate again, on condition that the parasite (even if 
it's you) will be automatically ejected from the host's body. Please note that the perk applies not only to 
physical parasitism, but also spiritual forms of parasitism such as possession (which is also pretty common here with things like Cursed Swords)."
13,,100CP,Snakeskin ,Generic Lewd Sci-Fi,Domain: Protection,"Why do you even bother with armor when the other guy has a disintegrator? It’s better just to sidestep 
the blast, so that’s what you do. The less your clothing is covering you up, the better you dodge and the 
faster you are. Wearing something as revealing as a space-fabric loincloth or latex bikini will give you 
enough of a speed and agility boost to rush and overwhelm a handful of opponents with blasters even if you were bare-handed."
14,,100CP,Wet Tshirt Contest ,Generic Hentai Modern,Domain: Protection,"When doing sports, you may come to realize that having J-cup breasts or a dick as long as your leg makes
going anywhere fast very painful. Thankfully, you don’t have that problem. As long as you’re in good 
health - ie, no broken bones or debilitating illnesses - you can move about with perfect ease. Even if 
they’re bigger than you are, walking around - or running, as is probably more accurate – won’t be hindered at all."
15,,100CP,What Doesn’t Kill You ,Generic Hentai Superheroes,Domain: Protection,"Hurts like a bitch. But you’ll survive. Your pain tolerance has increased, making lesser wounds less painful."
16,,100CP,Strategy Trance ,Brockton's Celestial Forge,Domain: Protection,"At will you may go into a trance in which your mind speeds up, your eyes glaze over and you start to 
instinctively analyze your current situation, any data points about your enemies, environment, your 
available powers and tools and their uses. You can then use all that information to instinctively construct 
hypothetical scenarios of possible resolutions to the encounter. After the trance ends you will have 
boosted competence to follow through with any plans you made within the trance, almost as if your 
instincts are guiding you.
The trance does not leave you defenseless, two things protect you during it, firstly a few external 
seconds of trance can be up to 10s of minutes of internal time. Secondly you will immediately wake up 
from the trance if you are attacked or if you would have wanted to be woken from it at any time for 
some other reason.
This perk is further boosted by any other mental perks you have and synergies and integrates aspects of 
all your mental perks to enhance the trance in some way or another."
17,,100CP,"Zero-G, Zero Problems ",Generic Lewd Sci-Fi,Domain: Protection,"Artificial gravity takes most of the space sickness out of space travel, but it can still unsettle every now 
and again. You’re now immune to motion sickness and vertigo, especially from zero or fluctuating gravity,
so engage in all the zero-g gymnastics you like."
18,,100CP,SUPERHUMAN DESIRE ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Protection,"You always wanted to be special and that want was itself so strong that you really did become so. 
Whenever you are subjected to a procedure that will improve or beneficially alter you with a chance of 
injury to you, death or even just the procedure failing outright, it will instead have a guaranteed chance 
of success. Risky operations will always go off without a hitch, shoving an energy source into your own 
body will have it combine with you successfully if there was even the smallest chance of you not dying."
19,,100CP,No Fainting ,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Protection,"Now, I know what you’re thinking. Whenever the monster catches the pretty lady, it rapes her into 
unconsciousness via sheer sexual overload. However, due to shenanigans, you can store this pleasure for 
enjoyment at a later date. It’s a tiny bit precognitive, as it will activate on its own right before something 
that actually would knock you out."
20,,100CP,Toggle ,Young Justice,Domain: Protection,"Toggle allows its user to forgo learning to control their powers by simply allowing them to turn their 
powers off when they aren't needed. This can be done per power, so there isn't a need to go without the
ability to teleport because you don't want to use your super strength. Also works on out of Jump powers.
You can think of this like a dial. It can be on, or full power, as well as off, or no power, and anywhere in 
between those two states."
21,,200CP,Blank II ,Essential Body Modification Supplement,Domain: Protection,"Abilities which gather information about your past, present, or future do not work on you. This includes 
scrying, divination, mind reading, and even cold reading and lie detection. This ability not only affects 
your immediate person but also provides a degree of protection to items and people around you, making
it difficult to predict the past, present, or future of any group you move with or vessel you travel on. If 
you have the Essential Mutuality perk, your affected companions gain the full benefit of your Blank perk 
even if they are acting independently.
I: You are immune to all supernatural and technological abilities and devices which perform the functions
described above. You simply do not register to such abilities, though your own abilities function 
normally. Purely mundane skills at cold reading or lie detection will be less effective, but still function to 
some degree. Dsc: Sch/Ass/Arc/Sup/Lch/Bea/Dra/Exp/Hea
II: Even mundane versions of the above items do not function against you. Furthermore, you are able to 
detect when someone is actively attempting to discern such information through supernatural or 
technological abilities or devices and feed them false information of the type they expect. Thus, you can 
feed an image of yourself asleep in bed to a scrying spell while you're secretly across town beating up 
thugs or you can have a truth detection spell return 'truth' when you are telling a lie. Note that this does 
not protect you from compulsions to tell the truth or share information directly. Additionally, any items 
which you create have a measure of this protection, making it difficult to predict actions directly relying 
on those items and making it impossible to detect the items themselves with most supernatural abilities."
22,,200CP,A Little Rape Never Hurt Anybody ,Generic Hentai Superheroes,Domain: Protection,"The human mind is designed to only be able to handle so much trauma. Too much forces it to shut down,
possibly even killing its owner. You no longer have to worry about this. Your body can handle the pain, 
both physical and mental, with no psychological trauma afterwards."
23,,200CP,Happily Ever After ,A Change In Tactics,Domain: Protection,"The Shepherds are heroes straight out of legend, and their adventures are the kind of tales which are 
beloved by children and immortalized by bards and artists. Such stories rarely end in heartbreak and 
tragedy, or with the married life being dull and unfulfilling, and yours won’t either. So long as you hold 
genuine love for your partner(s) the earth will move to bring you together and keep you together no 
matter what kind of adversity you might face, be it separation in wartime or more domestic relationship 
issues. While this won’t do anything to prevent conflicts from occurring, what conflicts do occur will 
always be able to be resolved, and as long as you don’t give up on the relationship it will always be 
salvageable no matter how bad the situation becomes. "
24,,200CP,BUOYANT ON THE SKEIN ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Protection,"Space-Time, or the skein of the universe, tends to be thought of as flat but distorted by gravity, the mass 
of objects sinking them into the skein and distorting it around them. The mass of your body and form, 
however, floats on the surface of the skein like a leaf on the surface of a pool; creating no disturbances 
around it, and always floating on the top while waves and currents pass beneath you. No need to cheat 
with anti-gravity or rest on top of a force field. Though you retain your mass, you are not subject to 
gravity if you do not wish to be, and are immune to attempts to affect you with gravitational 
disturbances and spatial distortions, unless you choose to disable this effect."
25,,200CP,Health Care Plan ,Generic Hentai Modern,Domain: Protection,"As much as this world runs on porn logic, that logic isn’t very stable, and there’s actually a lot of work 
that goes into it. However, not for you. While a casting crew would have to make sure to find actors with 
no STD’s, said diseases seem to flee your presence. Preparations, from foreplay to an ass cleaning for 
anal, simply happen ‘off screen’, allowing you to go directly from ‘lets fuck’, to actually fucking."
26,,200CP,Inoculated ,Bio-Weapon Quest,Domain: Protection,"You are immune to the chemicals and special powers of your creations. If you genetically engineered a 
snake, you'd be immune to its venom, if you transformed a schoolboy into a rape monster you'd be 
immune to their aphrodisiac pheromones and special attacks."
27,,200CP,Fashion ,Highschool of the Dead,Domain: Protection,"Your clothing and entire body acquire defensive properties equal to the most superior protective items 
you have currently equipped. Emphasis on protective item an iron or steel ring won't give you metal 
tough skin the minimum is things like knee pads from extreme sports, helmets even an apron would 
count, though all that'd do is protect you from the dangers of a kitchen"
28,,200CP,One Minor Exception ,Generic Hentai Modern,Domain: Protection,"There’s this one little highly inconvenient rule about idols that you’re probably about to run into. 
Specifically, no dating. No boyfriend. No sex! It’s supposed to preserve the appeal or something. But, 
since this is hentai, that rule was made to be broken. Even if someone gives you a firm talking too about 
how you aren’t allowed to date anyone, they'll fail to punish you for actually breaking it. Maybe even to 
notice you breaking it in the first place. Coincidentally, you also qualify as a virgin sacrifice even if you 
aren't. "
29,,200CP,Secretly A Masochistic Contortionist ,Generic BDSM,Domain: Protection,"Good thing you used to take ballet and gymnastics, jumper. I don't know how you would have been able 
to survive that split otherwise... what's happening to your underwear right now? Simply put, you are 
now inhumanly flexible and durable, and any sensation that would normally register as discomfort or 
pain is now pleasurable to you. This doesn't help with the muscle deterioration that sets in after six 
months in an armbinder, but whoever put it on you will be able to get your elbows to touch without 
dislocating your arms, and you'll enjoy every moment of it. You can choose to toggle this perk on and off 
at will and can always tell the difference between “good” pain and “bad” pain, i.e. the kind you get from 
a few hours at the gym versus the kind you get from a gunshot wound. The latter kind of pain does not 
trigger this perk’s effects by default unless you choose otherwise."
30,,200CP,Form Mastery III ,Essential Body Modification Supplement,Domain: Protection,"You are adept at changing between forms.
I: You may change forms over the course of about a second, even if you cannot concentrate properly. 
Being drunk, drugged, or half-unconscious can't stop you from changing shape to an alternate form. 
Alternate forms never result in dysmorphia for you.
II: As tier I, plus your shapechange is now instant, requires only a thought, and nothing short of a 
Drawback or Jump Fiat effect can stop you from doing so. Additionally, unless a Drawback of Jump Fiat 
effect says otherwise, you may have your clothing resize with you or merge into your body, as most 
appropriate to your new form.
III: As tier II, plus you may combine forms freely, choosing which aspects of each form to use for what 
purposes. This applies to any forms you may adopt through shapeshifting abilities, but it also includes 
alt-forms gained from other sources."
31,,200CP,Inertia of Self II ,Essential Body Modification Supplement,Domain: Protection,"You are protected against effects that would affect your mind and existence.
I: You are immune to any effect that would affect your memories. If someone turns back time, alters 
reality, or attempts to directly alter your memories, you retain both the 'original' and 'new' memories, 
instinctively knowing which set is which. Other than your two sets of memories, this perk does nothing 
to tell you who changed things or even what they specifically changed if it isn't otherwise obvious.
II: You are immune to any effect that would alter or outright destroy your body or existence. This 
protection extends to conceptual, temporal, and reality warping effects that work either directly or 
indirectly to destroy or alter you. This would prevent a time traveler from killing you as a baby or causing 
an accident that would leave present-you paralyzed. It would not protect you from a fireball created 
through temporal manipulation or having a time traveler frame you for a crime that lands you in prison."
32,,200CP,Showing Off ,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Protection,"Your body is (probably) nothing to be ashamed of, so don't be. No matter how far outside the so called 
dress code you get - bar actual nudity, because that's not clothes - no one will raise a complaint about 
said clothing. What's more, you won't feel any shame over your own questionable style of dress."
33,,200CP,Ward’s Maxim ,World of Tentacles,Domain: Protection,"Does nobody besides you read Lovecraft before they start dabbling with eldritch forces anymore?! 
You’ve learned to never call up anything that you can’t put down and you put that lesson into play by 
ensuring you’ll never lose control of your creations. Any creatures summoned or created by you as well as any devices you build have a built-in kill switch which you can use to restrain, kill, power off, or otherwise neutralize them at will. The nature of this trigger is up to you as long as the effects are the same, but it can only be exploited by you or those instructed in its use by you. You are also automatically inoculated against any chemical or biological 
agents you may create."
34,,200CP,Juggernaut ,Terraria,Domain: Protection,"Your armor is a lot more effective at doing what it does just by the sheer virtue of it being latched onto 
and wrapped around your fleshy bits. Not to get too far into the math of it, your armor is about half-again more effective than it would be otherwise."
35,,200CP,Where No One Has Come Before ,Generic Lewd Sci-Fi,Domain: Protection,"Protective outfits are often necessary to survive in hostile conditions comfortably, but as long as you’re 
wearing the most important parts you can expose some of yourself without harm. If most of your space 
suit is ripped away, as long as your air tank and helmet is fine you’ll be able to survive in space, or you’ll be able to unzip your pants in a toxic atmosphere to screw a Venusian without worry."
36,,200CP,Mental Resistance III ,Essential Body Modification Supplement,Domain: Protection,"Your mind and will are strong.
I: You are very difficult to intimidate and have a high resistance to mental fatigue (such as from extended 
warfare or study) and can generally delay dealing with mental trauma until any immediate crisis is dealt 
with. Also, you do not get bored with tasks easily and can study or practice abilities for extended periods 
without penalty or need for a break.
II: Immunity to the items in tier I plus a high degree of resistance to memetic hazards, insanity,mind 
control, and other factors that would impact how your mind works.
III: Complete immunity to the items in tiers I and II."
37,,200CP,Release Mechanism ,Generic BDSM,Domain: Protection,"Sometimes you just want to be tied up, but you may not always have someone around to do the tying 
and more importantly, to release you once you've had your fun. It's a good thing for you then, that you 
now know how to include an emergency escape into anything you set up yourself. This goes beyond 
understanding how to use ice to keep a key out of reach for an hour or two: if you build a machine, you 
will always be able to include some kind of shut-off switch in a discreet spot that you can still get to 
easily if things go wrong. If you find yourself in the middle of casting a magic spell and suddenly need to 
stop, you now know just how to stop without releasing unstable energies that could harm you or your surroundings."
38,,200CP,Professor Guinea Pig ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Protection,"You have successfully managed to transplant your own brain into a jar now attached to your body! 
How?...I...I don't actually know. Regardless, you have the ability to use your own body and mind as a 
guinea pig with you as a one-man science team, even if it would normally be improbable or downright 
impossible. Replace both your arms with robotic copies at the same time, shove organs into robotic 
vessels and armor, and so on. All by yourself. Don't think about it too hard."
39,,200CP,Clothing Un-damage ,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Protection,"The less armor you wear, the less likely it is to be hit, and thus the less likely it is to be damaged. But of 
course, armor that is ignored is no armor at all. No matter how flimsy or how little it leaves to the 
imagination, your armor is just that. Armor. A steel plate bikini is as good as a set of full steel plate, and 
something made of a magical metal like mythril would be even better. Basically, you can now get away with absurd ‘fantasy style armor’ without the logical consequences of leaving your boobs/abdomen exposed that would normally ensue."
40,,200CP,Prototype Process ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Protection,"Science is a learning process and sometimes that learning process involves explosions, malfunctions, or idiots messing with things they shouldn't. Well, they used to, anyways. When technology you've built or used would normally suffer a malfunction or an experiment would become a disaster, it will instead create a harmless inconvenience instead of blowing up in your face. A device's sensitive power core being struck would see it shut down immediately, a DNA serum you inject into yourself gives you mild indigestion instead of mutating you into a horrible monster, and so on. If a result would be entirely negative for you, the impact is dulled to a comical accident instead of something that could endanger your life and those of others. How lucky for you.
FREE: Smartest In Five Galaxies [Free for Genius] – Three galaxies! THREE! Why is that so hard to get right?! Either way, people tend not to question or doubt you in your fields of expertise, which given your experiences on this journey, might well be a lot of things! When you speak, others tend to believe you're the smartest one in the room or at least somebody worth listening to when it comes to a matter you're an expert of, like advanced technology or just using common sense. Even if you've done very questionable things with that expertise, people tend to consider your input important enough to at least hear out.
FREE: Look, this sort of thing just happens. Sometimes you're doing a normal experiment and suddenly the lab has an accident and now whatever you're working on is starting to talk to you. When it does, it's your duty to take responsibility for it like a good creator should. Whenever you create life, whether by accident or design, you know how to properly treat and either tame or raise your creations. Regardless of whether they're as smart as a small puppy or able to speak fluently in your language a day in, you know how to treat them properly to the point they will obey you or at least not try to bite your head off. This only works if you don't abuse or hurt them, mind, so try not to be an idiot when your toaster starts speaking in tongues."
41,,200CP,Safety First ,Cardcaptor Sakura,Domain: Protection,"You can choose to be completely unaffected by your own magic when it suits you, including beings that 
were created by you or spells taught to others that you designed."
42,,200CP,Stavros Mueller Beta ,Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,Domain: Protection,"You know when you're going to die in any universe or rather, you have a very good idea of at least one 
event that has to happen before you can die. Time Travel Is FUN!"
43,,200CP,Surpassing the Creator ,NieR Automata,Domain: Protection,"The aliens made you with a purpose. They defined you with rules. Behaviors. Limits. Your siblings bent 
those rules and exterminated their creators. You broke them entirely. The only limits and rules you 
follow are those you choose to. You're no longer bound by any sort of programmed rules or biological 
instincts or even supernatural restrictions on your behavior or free will. You are aware of them and to 
those unaware of your freedom, you may even appear to still be restrained by them, but you can choose 
to act as you will entirely unrestricted by them. A god of the machine can't be bound by mortal rules."
44,,200CP,Things best not known ,Smash Up-Obligatory Cthulhu Supplement,Domain: Protection,"You don't go mad from cosmic truths, but have a sense for when such secrets are dangerous to others. 
You are good at explaining things away besides. Best not to spread the madness around."
45,,200CP,Wavestrength ,NieR Automata,Domain: Protection,"The signal is clear and strong. You wouldn't be able to do your job if you couldn't connect to your girls in 
the field so thankfully you never experience issues with your connections. As long as your targets are in 
range, your broadcasts cannot be blocked, intercepted, hacked or otherwise interfered with. Even when 
you should be prevented from sending out anything at all, as long as you have something that can 
broadcast, it will broadcast. At perfect quality on both ends as well, ensuring that any signal that comes 
to you will be received without interference as well, at least when from your allies."
46,,200CP,Not a Single Stitch Left ,Generic Hentai Magical Girl,Domain: Protection,"It’s a good thing that the clothing for a Shoujo repairs itself every transformation, or they’d have some 
truly massive clothing bills. However, even though that clothing is destroyed, the actual protective 
enchantments - which probably exist - are still there. In other words, as long as you don’t put anything 
else on, you’ll have the same bonus as though you were wearing the last thing you wore. Normally this 
would only apply to you Shoujo costume, but now it applies to other things too."
47,,300CP,Brain in the Butt ,Donkey Kong Country,Domain: Protection,"You can transfer the location of your internal organs and other bodily systems such as your brain to other
places within your body. And it won't disrupt your normal bodily functions (unlike a certain croc who 
went from psychopath to dimwit when his brain slipped down to his tail)."
48,,400CP,Concept Ball ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Protection,"When two combatants reach a certain level of power, fighting becomes a bit pointless. When both of you
are Immovable Objects and Unstoppable Forces, you're just going to be pointlessly nudging against each 
other. Well, if you were equal you would be. But you're Not Equal. Whenever your own abilities that are 
meant to be without peer come into conflict with another such ability, yours trumps theirs. A blow that 
can pierce anything will tear through a defence that can block anything when you are using it. Your 
absolutes are more so, simply for the fact that you are the one using them."
49,,400CP,Context Problem ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Protection,"Magic comes from mana, or maybe it doesn't. It could just be life energy that makes using it easier. 
Maybe it's just really advanced science? Or is science really advanced magic? For some reason, your foes 
and onlookers have trouble nailing down what your abilities are and how they actually work. Instead of 
using things like context clues and experiences, they will assume it's something that makes sense to their
world instead of leaping to 'otherworldly invaders', and almost always in a way that gives you an 
advantage over them. It might be years before someone actually realizes how your special abilities actually work, let alone any weaknesses. Suckers!"
50,,400CP,All Day Every Day ,Generic Hentai Occult,Domain: Protection,"Don’t you ever get bored of this? Once you’ve modeled the world to your liking, all the uniqueness will 
be gone. Hearing ‘Would you like your morning blowjob master?’ might get you hard the first few 
(dozen) times, but eventually even women screaming your praise as they faint from overstimulation 
must get old. You did kinda drain the originality out of them you know? ...No? Well, I guess it’s just me 
then. Have fun with your slaves."
51,,400CP,Better Than Death ,Generic Hentai World,Domain: Protection,"Death is a very final thing so almost anything is better than that final separation from your beloved. If an 
enemy has a reasonable chance of capturing, and keeping captured despite their own efforts, either you 
or your love then there will be a significant chance of them doing so rather than immediately killing 
either of you. This specialised form of plot armor manifests as a combination of a mental inclination 
towards that end and recognisable opportunities cropping up which would make it advantageous for 
them to do this. However the protection by this perk offers fails while you are in the presence of your 
love. In addition, if an enemy is truly intent on death then, at best, this perk can delay that for a time by 
making them more likely to 'play'. "
52,,400CP,Blackmail Proof ,Generic Hentai Modern,Domain: Protection,"Now, it’s not to say that you simply can’t be blackmailed, but the vast majority of attempts to gather 
material to blackmail you with simply won't work. The key here is ‘could you have done anything’, like 
physically remove the camera from its hiding spot before anything could be taken, or sneaking into the 
security office to erase the last five minutes. Regardless of if you actually knew it was coming, as long as 
you could have gotten rid of it, it will do so automatically. Or if you prefer, it can be shunted into the 
warehouse for your perusal. "
53,,400CP,Enigmatic Engineering ,Stellaris,Domain: Protection,"Your technology has rights-management included at the reality-level. You can decide who can reverse-
engineer, derive from, manufacture, and even use your technologies. And you can change it at a 
moments' notice. If your xeno ally turns on you, then you can simply revoke access to those lasers you 
loaned them. Which not only disarms the ships equipped with the blueprints you gave them, it would 
also disarm ships armed with weapons derived from your gifts. Not only that, but the documentation, 
controls, and hardware suddenly become inscrutable. You could have soldiers looking at their guns 
wondering what the trigger does. This perk also protects from traitors trying to give away your technology, as well."
54,,400CP,Corruption and Conviction ,World of Tentacles,Domain: Protection,"A dark and twisted power is the birthright of every demon king, and sin flows through your veins like 
blood. Is it any wonder, then, that the corruption which normally afflicts practitioners of the dark arts 
has so little hold on you? You possess a will of steel and are immune to most forms of corruption and 
mind control. No matter what depraved powers you might possess or be subjected to, your mind and 
body will always remain your own. Should you choose to indulge in the effects such magics might 
normally foist on you then that is another matter, but these effects influence you only with your express 
permission, and you may rescind that permission whenever you please. But beware of holy and divine 
magics when you indulge, for your resistance is less effective against magic that cleanses and purifies. "
55,,400CP,Genetic Diversity ,Generic Hentai Modern,Domain: Protection,"You have had so many forms from your jumps that your children will never receive genes from you that 
will cause them any problems even if their other parent is one of your relatives, their half sibling, or even a clone of you."
56,,400CP,Happily Ever After ,Milk Hunters,Domain: Protection,"As I’ve previously mentioned, Senpai has been going around and raping anyone who catches his eye, 
when they’re rendered unconscious by the energy that appears during monster attacks. With that in 
mind, in addition to said monster attacks, something to help keep your loved ones safe seems like a good
idea. This perk will give your friends and lovers a form of plot armor. It won’t be as powerful as 
Bystander Effect, but it should still be more than enough. Someone, or something, that’s out looking for 
victims will overlook those that you care about, in favor of others. If they’re still targeted, for some 
reason --if the one targeting them was specifically after them, or there was nobody else around for them
to target, for example--, they will have supernatural luck in escaping relatively unharmed; their attacker 
will trip, people who can help will stumble across them, they’ll instinctually choose the best escape 
routes, and so on. On top of all of this, you will also be able to feel when those that you care about are in
danger, and how badly they need your help. Of course, you can turn this sense off, if you want, but why 
would you?"
57,,400CP,Environmental Tolerance IV ,Essential Body Modification Supplement,Domain: Protection,"You are not damaged by hazardous environments, though this does not provide you a method of 
propulsion.
I: You no longer need to breathe and do not suffer from temperatures between -100C and +100C (-150F 
to +200F). You are immune to most radiation (up to about 1,000 mSv; the amount experienced during 
unshielded exposure to space).
II: As tier I, plus you do not suffer from temperatures below 1500C (+2700F) or the effects of pressure 
lower than 1000 atmospheres (including the effects of vacuum). You are immune to the effects of 
radiation at all levels.
III: As tier II, but the protection extends to any non-magical environmental source.
IV: As tier III, but the protection extends to magical environments such as energy planes."
58,,400CP,Love Overcomes All ,Milk Hunters,Domain: Protection,"Assuming that you decide to steal/”rescue” the Pretty Cures from Senpai, having a harem of several girls 
might raise a few eyebrows. Especially if you’re dating fourteen-year-olds while you’re in your mid-
twenties. Fortunately, you won’t have to worry about that. From now on, nobody outside of your 
relationship will judge you or your lover(/s) for anything related to said relationship; the number of 
people involved, the ages of those involved, the genders of those involved, and so on. This will also work 
on overprotective family members and jealous exes."
59,,400CP,Man Of Mystery ,Generic Hentai Occult,Domain: Protection,"Don’t you know that women just love a man of mystery? Well, you certainly are one. Simply put, you 
can, at any time, erase, remove, or otherwise hide any recorded information about yourself that 
currently exists. Security camera? Freak accident in power fluctuation erased it right before it was 
accessed. Yes, ‘accident’... And, as I said, women love a man of mystery. Not good for lasting 
relationships, but the less they know about you, the sexier you seem to them."
60,,400CP,Failsafe ,Supergod,Domain: Protection,"It might be worth just taking a step back from this all. This superhuman arms race, is it really all a good 
idea? I guess not. You may not have the power to stop your country from foolishly creating a weapon of 
mass destruction but with this, you'll at least be able to stop that weapon from being the thing to 
destroy you all straight away. Your experiments and efforts at crafting or creating something never 
backfire on you. When they fail, be it a self-destruction or turning against you, they will instead shudder 
to a stop and deactivate harmlessly. You won't automatically know what caused them to go wrong, 
though you can probably find out with some effort, but with this no process or invention you make and 
are in the control of will end in your harm or death. Others can still be harmed a plenty though, so long 
as it wouldn't harm or endanger you as well."
61,,400CP,Friends on the Other Side ,Lords of the Night - Zombies,Domain: Protection,"Ether Zombies oftentimes are guided by strange voices, spiritual presences no one else feels or 
experiences. You are one of them, but the forces guiding you are clearly helping you and furthering your 
interests. You are just given an advantage at... everything. You pick the right door at the end of a riddle 
without reading the riddle. You aim for weak spots you never noticed. You react to attacks you never saw
coming. This never gives you more than immediate knowledge, and about things happening right around
you now. It can help you pick the right answer from a multiple choice question with a definite right 
answer, but can't tell you if a friend will betray you next week. Not even if they made the choice right 
now, unless they are in your presence when they make that choice. Within these limitations, they're 
overwhelmingly strong. If you needed to mechanically represent this for something other than multiple 
choice (which you'll just always win), think of it like a +10 insight bonus on everything that makes sense 
for an insight bonus. The forces helping you are outer-planes forces. Powers that hedge them out can 
interfere. They also work through divination. Powers that protect against divination can also interfere. 
Though that interference can still say something, and they'll likely pass that on to you."
62,,400CP,Sneaky Fucker ,World of Tentacles,Domain: Protection,"Humans have built up quite the society to protect themselves from predators like you, but all the walls 
and gates and guards in the world can’t stop you if they don’t know you’re there. Your stealth skill is 
uncanny: you move with abnormal quiet, blend in with your surroundings, and leave much less of a trail 
than you should, even ghosting past automated surveillance and leaving an indistinct blur on unwanted 
video recordings. Mundane tracking methods like forensics and DNA analysis produce no useful data 
about you, and magical methods fare little better. Perhaps most terrifyingly, you can extend the benefits 
of this perk to any victims you might be carrying with you, allowing you to kidnap people without leaving
any trail to follow. However if you are caught somehow you lose this perk’s benefits until you escape any 
pursuit."
63,,400CP,Unbeliever ,Rance 02,Domain: Protection,"So Divine Magic works based on your piety? Doesn’t matter, you can use it perfectly while not believing 
in any God and even ‘getting along’ with devils. Exactly, when it comes down to your powers, you can 
skip that kind of troublesome requirements. Even something like using contradictory powers at the same
time, becomes easy and without any negative effects. Still, wouldn’t you prefer to act the part from time 
to time? "
64,,400CP,God of Death ,Death Note,Domain: Protection,"You gain the ability to phase through walls and don't require food, water, sleep or air."
65,,400CP,Harmony ,Generic First Jump,Domain: Protection,"Sometimes, the things you are collecting will clash with each other or are difficult to use together. That is
no longer the case. You could safely use both the Dark and Light sides of the Force, channel both divine 
and demonic energies, wield conflicting forms of magic or energy, mix radically different technologies or 
biologies, even keep your entire harem in one place, and they will all get along with each other. They will
get along with you as well. None of your abilities, possessions, Companions or anything else that belongs
to you in some way will be able to harm, corrupt, or alter you against your will."
66,,400CP,Immunity ,Draka Series,Domain: Protection,"What are you immune to? What aren't you immune to, Jumper? Your body, mind, and soul flat out 
ignore any effects that could semi-plausibly be described as a disease, an illness, or a corruption. 
Whether it be a biological disease, weaponized nanotech, a magical curse, infectious memes, a literal 
madness plague, or whatever else, you won't even feel it.
Anything that wishes to harm you has to do so directly, via main force. So being shot, stabbed, or set on 
fire, or being mind-controlled by superior psychic force, or having your soul destroyed by a Killing Curse...
those sorts of things still work. But any and all attempts to bring you down by subtler, more internal 
means just fail utterly."
67,,400CP,Loading Human.exe ,Generic Worm Fanfiction lll,Domain: Protection,"You can turn off your emotions at will. This makes it easier to make logical decisions but you have trouble
understanding others while they're off. You won't get stuck with them off because turning them back on 
would be illogical or anything like that. Oh, and you get along famously with robots and AI. You really get them."
68,,400CP,LOCKED ROOMS ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Protection,"Your mind can be compartmentalized to a variety of ends. You could shunt data to a locked room in your 
mind, one which memetic effects, viruses, or corrupted data cannot escape. Or just block off certain 
knowledge until the time is right for you to access it. These locked rooms cannot be read by mind-
reading methods unless you willingly open them. You can even lock a compartment of your mind and 
figuratively throw away the key, keeping it sealed even from yourself until some condition is met. They 
will also be able to contain any interlopers, memetics or unusual effects that stray into your mind from 
other sources, digital or not, though you should act fast so as to avoid locking away the majority of your 
mind."
69,,400CP,MOTHERSHIP ,Culture,Domain: Protection,"Despite how independent most Ships end up being, they tend to owe extremely strong ties to their 
constructor units. The fabricating vessel remains important to many ships, something as close as they get
to family, so those ships who manufacture a lot of others tend to be able to call on them when needed. 
The Minds and Ships you build have a strong loyalty and connection to you. It's almost guaranteed that if
you wanted to bring them in on a scheme that most Minds would reject or object to, they would accept 
out of what they feel are familial ties, the bond nearly unbreakable. This applies to all your children, 
descendants and sentient creations."
70,,400CP,Not This Again ,Girl's Frontline,Domain: Protection,"You know how mad scientists never seem to learn from their mistakes? Like, when their colleague 
discovers the secret to a more powerful AI, but the coding makes commands like Protect the factory 
from intruders basically orders for genocide? Luckily, you're much better at learning from your mistakes 
or others'; the more immediate your contact with said screw-up, the less likely you are to repeat it even 
accidentally. This can be trained like any other skill; with time, you can train yourself to do just about 
anything your body is capable of to near-zero margins of error, although progress tends to slow down 
when you reach the half-way mark."
71,,400CP,Phylactery ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Protection,"An item used by Liches to serve as the vessel for their soul. From the soul, you can remotely control your 
body and see through it. Since the phylactery keeps your soul separate from your body, your mind 
remains unaffected by hormones, spirit energy, pain, and other sensations that would normally disrupt 
your concentration. If the phylactery is damaged, your soul will automatically return to your body."
72,,400CP,Renewal ,Age of Wonders ll,Domain: Protection,"Wounds can be mended, cities can be rebuilt. Even the lands tainted by death magics or burnt by fire can
be restored, seeded with crops and forests until life flourishes anew. Life magic embodies this ideal, 
holding the power to endure, to undo all harms and ease all woes. Your spells and abilities are infused 
with this power, and it is impossible to corrupt or twist them against their purpose. Furthermore, 
although your magics are now more difficult to suppress or destroy, if your enchantments are only 
partially broken they will slowly restore themselves to their full potential, their own magical natures 
healing as surely as more physical wounds."
73,,400CP,Safe Self Modification ,SB Dragonball Z,Domain: Protection,"Putting your brain inside a jar so you can transfer it into a robot body may not seem like the smartest 
thing to others. However, they don't know that you have the peculiar ability to always succeed in your 
self-modifications. The chances of things going wrong with the procedure are simply zero. As long as the 
technology behind it is solid, then malfunctions, complications in surgery, and other accidents like that 
just don't happen. In addition, none of the modifications you make will ever be incompatible, or conflict 
with each other. Want to use gene therapy on your robot body? That somehow works."
74,,400CP,Sixth Sense of the Sith ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Protection,"You have especially high olfactory senses that not only strengthen your normal senses such as smell and 
hearing but also give you an ability to sense danger. You are able to sense threats to both yourself and 
people you care about. Furthermore, you have a study sense that helps you concentrate and develop 
skills that will help the people you care about; for example, if you wanted to help a wizard companion in 
his studies, you would be able to master enough sorcerous skills to competently assist him, and if you 
were part of a royal court you could quickly pick up proper etiquette so that you never embarrass your 
mistress during official functions."
75,,400CP,THEY ARE MINE AND MINE ALONE ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Protection,"Perhaps you can no longer lose your powers due to your own growing up but it's still possible for people 
to take them away from you by force. Or at least it was before you made it known how much you refuse 
to let go of what you consider yours. It's impossible to degrade or take away your abilities in any shape 
or form, even on a merely temporary basis. Attempts to weaken, nullify, disable, steal, destroy or do any 
other sort of negative thing to your powers or the energies that they run on will find themselves not 
even touching you. It seems like your powers really are too integral to your being to ever be taken away 
from you."
76,,400CP,Tower of Naraka ,Asura's Wrath,Domain: Protection,"After suffering a fatal blow, your soul will appear in the white void between life and reincarnation. This is 
Naraka, realm of infinite towers. To leave it, you must ascend the tower, and no amount of flight or 
power allows you to cheat the distance the journey back to the living world is as long as it needs to be to
attain the necessary enlightenment. It will take you anywhere from 12,000 years to 1 year to climb back 
out to your lifeless body (which has regenerated and been rendered indestructible in the meantime). 
Mortals might build a shrine around your fossilized form Mantra directed to you helps you ascend faster. 
If you're still in Naraka and not in your body when the current jump concludes, the Jumpchain ends. 
Falling off the tower, failing to ascend by jumpend, you reaching fail condition, or ten years passing also 
ends the chain. Alternatively, instead of outright killing an opponent, you may send their soul to Naraka 
and require them to climb out."
77,,600CP,BETTER GO READ MY OWN MANUAL ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Protection,"You have mental libraries of everything you are, what you carry and what you can do. If you need to 
know if or how you can do something that is within your capabilities, the information is there. This 
information covers your belongings, inventory and personal equipment as well, updating in real time. It 
is most useful for configuring yourself or your assets to carry out a task you haven't personally done 
before, but this detailed manual also holds the sum of the technology that makes up your body, allowing 
you to fully repair, rearm or fully construct a new from first principles all the technology that your body 
has incorporated within it. It does not, unfortunately, provide information on things you know nothing 
about, or things that are just so bizarre that nobody has considered them, but may contain theoretical 
notes. Very theoretical notes. Carrying out those never-considered options lies in your hands."
78,,600CP,By the grace of the Machine God ,Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Protection,"By His blessing, let the machine be sanctified. With ritual and prayer, protect His works from corruption 
and witchery. Raise a bulwark of iron anointed with sacred oil and incense and safeguarded its form and 
functions from eldritch powers. Be their origin within the material or immaterial, powers that attempt to
twist the form or control the functions of your machines will be repulsed. Minor hexes and vexes will be 
repelled with contemptuous ease, while mightier powers must devote a great deal of power and 
concentration to overcome this protection. Even then, they will struggle to do so."
79,,600CP,Humans First ,Supergod,Domain: Protection,"Humans are far from safe from use for the experiments of the powerful in their pursuit of more power. If
you're unlucky, you could be turned into a subject yourself. But if you are, you're one of those maybe 
fortunate few that can turn it back on your captors. You always retain control over your mind and body 
when changed or mutated, no matter what is doing the changing, and can even refuse some or all of the 
changes as you see fit. Bond with an alien spore and you remain in full control of the new powers, rather
than the spore being the controller."
80,,600CP,Infinite Improbability ,Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,Domain: Protection,"You are now the luckiest being in the universe at least when it comes to survival. If there is even the 
faintest chance of you surviving something? You will. You may not enjoy it, but you'll survive it. 
Unfortunately, the trade off is that wildly improbable things keep happening to you. Now, you can turn 
off this protection and have a peaceful life instead but then you're not guaranteed survival. Somehow, no
matter where you go, regardless of if the rest of this is toggled on or off, you'll always have done the 
equivalent of having read the safety instructions and memorized all the escape routes and emergency 
procedures for anything. This covers everything from knowing how to safely exit a crashing starship to 
how to initiate emergency shutdown of an out of control reactor. Somehow, knowing all this will not 
make you a dreadfully dull person."
81,,600CP,Limits? ,Generic Worm Fanfiction,Domain: Protection,"So powers are supposed to be limited aren't they? Depends on the fanfic, really. Either way, yours aren't.
No, this doesn't double your powers every six months. That'd be crazy. What this does is smash every 
glass ceiling, barrier or restriction into so much dust. Any and all of your powers, abilities, skills etc., are 
like muscles for you now, only growing stronger the more you exercise them. This does nothing for your 
rate, at least by itself, but it means that regardless of how they're supposed to operate, any and all of 
your powers can now be trained up infinitely. Furthermore, no power or skill you have can ever harm 
you directly, unless it's someone else using it on you. Nor, for that matter, can anything you do to 
improve yourself. Too much, at least. Training too much till you break half your muscles will still put you 
in the hospital, but what would be a lifelong crippling for others would only be a temporary thing for 
you, and you'd still benefit fully. You can use and develop mutually exclusive or opposite powers without 
any harm, and similarly use any and all powers you have without fear of ruining your own body or mind 
or whatever. No amount of overusing your powers can hurt you or them permanently. Again, you might 
suffer for a while, but it'll only ever be temporary and they'd grow that much stronger for it."
82,,600CP,Luck Forgives All Sins ,Warhammer 40k: Tau Empire,Domain: Protection,"Developing AI without instigating a rebellion. Fiddling with Warp travel without Gellar fields. Messing 
with biological manipulation and nanotechnology without creating a homogenizing swarm. While you or 
those under you work to push technology forward, you will somehow stumble your way around or past 
the major drawbacks and potential disasters you could invite, whether you know they are there or not. 
This won't let you ignore those threats, but will push you to solutions that don't trigger them, such as 
skimming the warp instead of entering it, even if this results in inferior results. Unless you know about a 
threat and deliberately work in such a way as to trigger it (such as trying to form grey goo), your luck will hold."

I: You are immune to normal diseases, parasites, bacteria, toxins, and the degenerative effects of 
radiation.
II: You are immune to the items listed in tier I, regardless of origin. When you are injured, the injury is 
approximately 25% less than it would be otherwise. You also have a high pain tolerance.
III: As tier II, but your resistance to damage increases to 50%. You are also, at your discretion, resistant to
effects that would mutate or alter your form.
IV: As tier III, but your resistance to damage increases to 75%. You are also immune to the effects of pain,

stretching of certain holes. As long as you get 8 hours of uninterrupted rest, they will be all healed."
85,,600CP,"Anonymous Doesn’t Forget, But Everyone Else... ",Kamikaze Kommittee Ouka,Domain: Protection,"You are the epitome of anonymity. People will literally have trouble remembering who you are and what 
you look like most of the time. Even if you pull some of the craziest stunts, they will forget all about you 
personally after a few minutes — even if they remember the event. It makes for an easy getaway when 
people have witnessed your shenanigans. This even affects electronic surveillance. For some reason, 
your face and identifying features just seem to blur and pixelate even more than the worst CCTV system. 
Of course, you can toggle this on and off whenever you want. Yep, a completely forgettable individual. 
I’m sure you won’t abuse this too much, right? ...Right? "
86,,600CP,Primacy ,Eclipse Phase,Domain: Protection,"So often when people fork themselves they don't consider the ramifications of what happens when their
forks disagree with them; each one considers themselves to be the originals, each one claiming to be 
equal to the others. Without having to put any annoying psychosurgery in place, any and all copies of 
your forks, clones, self-duplicates, shadow copies etc. will recognise that you are Jumper Prime, the 
original, and that they are the duplicates. Even copies of you that you didn't make such as if someone 
got a sample of your DNA and grew themselves a clone recognise you as their original. This recognition 
gives you a significant degree of authority over your copies: they tend to default to your orders and see 
you as superior even if you are technically identical to them. Other versions of you with different 
motivations or programming (eg: evil clones) still have that programming, but might be more reluctant to
fight someone they know is their original or maybe they'll be more eager to fight, depending on your personality."
87,,600CP,Removed From Context ,Young Justice,Domain: Protection,"Being from outside of this world makes it much harder for others to predict what you're doing or planning at any given time, making you harder to counter in a fight as well as harder to plan against. In addition, it's impossible to replicate your powers and technology that aren't native to whatever world you're in. If you willingly choose to share or give your technology, then it may be replicated.

FREE: Most Common Superpower: Whether or not they actually are a hero, everyone still looks the part; the appearances of you and your companions are now well above average, making you all very handsome/gorgeous. (Free)
FREE: Required Secondary Powers: The powers here run on comic book physics, letting their users do things like lifting heavy objects without sinking into the ground and running at super speeds without catching their hair on fire. Powers that overlap with the powers you purchase/get here, such as multiple super strength powers, also benefit from this. (Free)

88,,600CP,Fragment Of A Pure Heart ,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Protection,"The problem with being the Hero or Heroine in a place like this is that every self proclaimed demon lord 
and every self important noble slimeball is going to want you in some way. Could be a trophy wife, could 
be a sex slave, but they're going to want you. Your body resists these changes, requiring more effort to inflict them upon you, and forcing them back out if left unattended - though, that may take years. However, regardless of what they do to your mind and body in order to break you, there will always be a small part of your mind that remains 
you. You might be left trapped in your own body, but come the end of the jump, that fragment will get 
you out of there and purge the changes for the next jump. "
89,,600CP,ROOT OF ALL GENIUS ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Protection,"The greatest minds of our world didn't make their great discoveries when they lived happy, peaceful 
lives. They made them in times of war, after living through hell themselves. Or at least that's the view of 
a certain young genius. The worse the situation you find yourself in or the more miserable you are on a 
personal level, the better you and your powers will get. A little constant annoyance won't make much 
discernable difference but constantly subjecting yourself to tortures and poisons and purposefully 
ruining your relationships with those you love, all the while reaching the climax of the villain's evil plan, 
and you could dwarf your original power, so long as you kept yourself in that situation."

reached the “marry them all” stage in your journey where your entire harem is in love with you (and 
possibly each other) and everyone is happy to share, or if you haven’t yet then you will eventually. Once 
you’ve reached this ideal state nothing short of deliberate abuse or neglect on your part can make the 
members of your harem break up or fall out of love with you or with each other. New girls will be 
welcomed into the fold by their elder sisters rather than shunned or rejected, though this doesn’t 
guarantee a lack of personality conflicts. Even if you vanish into a Gauntlet for a hundred years or do a 
stint as an evil overlord they’ll all continue to love and support you, if perhaps from a distance, until you return to them. "

by forces greater than yourself, and just how doomed you currently are. Thankfully, you're exceptionally 
good at planning around those things. You could literally leap out a window in a skyscraper without a 
plan and come up with one on the way down. The more screwed you are, the more outmatched you are,
the closer the end of the world is, the clearer and faster you think and the luckier you get. As long as 
someone isn't specifically targeting you, you are almost certain to come up with some hair-brained 
scheme to survive, and have it work. Once per jump, when you would otherwise have died, you will 
spontaneously find yourself in a new version of that reality, one exactly like the original, but missing 
whatever just killed you. If it's an individual, they'll be someplace else at the time."

systems, you have been transformed into something incredible. Your body isn’t soft like meat - it’s like a 
statue of bronze, strong enough to tear through walls. Your stamina is utterly inexhaustible provided you have the smallest amounts of food, air and water to sustain yourself. With an iron body comes an iron mind: capable of extreme feats of mental and bodily control to withstand any injury, torture or hardship. If your body is mechanically able to perform a task, you can do it; likewise, you can fully ignore any sensations of pain or pleasure just by willing it so. It’s not an exaggeration to say you could fuck for days on end if you felt like it."

shells grow back thicker. The most heavily-worked muscles bulge with new tissue. Overtaxed acid glands 
are pumped full of hormones to encourage development. Worse, when these tougher variations and 
dragged back to a hive for re-absorption the new traits are passed on to all future generations. That gift 
is now yours. When overworked and under stress, growth is immediate and noticeable. Skin toughens in 
response to cuts. Bones grow back even stronger. Even the mind grows sharper when taxed, and your 
body will automatically work to ensure every enhanced trait is carefully balanced with the rest of your 
biology - develop hyper-acute senses, and the mind will adjust to handle the new input."
94,,600CP,Master of Masters,Generic BDSM,Domain: Protection,"To be a master is to be naturally-inclined to gain power and stand above others. You are the logical 
conclusion to that statement: a master who stands above even other dominants. Your will is absolutely 
ironclad and impossible to break: be it via torture or mind control or other methods, you will kneel to 
neither man nor god. But the same cannot be said for others: when subjected to your methods, even the
fiercest dominatrix may find herself developing a submissive streak, if only where you are concerned."
95,,600CP,The Holy Collection ,Dies Irae,Domain: Protection,"Very few are capable of touching the Lance of Longinus and surviving. Only two men at this time are 
great enough to truly wield it. The reason for this is that the Lance seeks to protect itself from outsiders, 
burning away at the body, mind and soul of any who touch it without permission. Only those of earth 
shattering power can bypass this without being the true owner of the Lance. Now they'll need the same 
permission to touch anything that you own. So long as it is a possession of yours, you are able to extend 
this same three target ward to any object you possess. Any who touch your weapons, armor, accessories,
clothes or even idle trinkets or money without permission will find their bodies rotting, their minds 
shattering and their souls burning away, quickly enough to kill in just seconds for most or even less for 
those truly weak compared to you. Those near or equal to your power will still be harmed but it would 
take a few minutes of contact for them to be severely harmed. Those far above you will be unfortunately
largely unaffected, at least until you become stronger. You can choose to disable this effect for specific 
objects, specific people or overall as you please."
96,,900CP,Accentuate the Positive | Eliminate the Negative ,Limitless,Domain: Protection,"-Accentuate the Positive (400CP) You now have an immunity to side effects of a certain kind. A super 
cool sword that takes over the body of its wielder? It's not getting even an inch inside of you. A demon 
making a pact with you for powers? Well, he is inside of your soul, but he's now stuck, only able to fuel 
your new abilities like a glorified battery. This perk only protects you against sources of power from 
outside of your body, including combat drugs, artifacts, enchantments, magical pacts, items and other 
things you wield by giving you only the beneficial parts and leaving the rest behind. This comes with 
complete immunity to addiction.
-Eliminate the Negative (500CP) Now the immunity to side effects can affect internal things. Magic that 
may have drawn on your emotions to fuel its power now has a separate pool. Any drawbacks your 
powers, biological traits or magic systems may have held have been wiped away."
