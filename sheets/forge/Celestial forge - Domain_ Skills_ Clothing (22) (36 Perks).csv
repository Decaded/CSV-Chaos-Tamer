0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,100CP,Battle-Ready Bathrobes ,Elder Scrolls Online,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"The title of ""clothier"" is misleading. Rather than being a simple seamstress, it's more accurate to say that a clothier specializes in making subtle but protective light armor that can easily transition from the ballroom to the battlefield and durable yet flexible medium-weight armors that are adored by scouts and survivalists during long treks. You now have that set of skills, able to craft any armor up to Rank Five (Ebonthread and Fellhide) and refine it with tannins. In time, you may be able to expand your skills further, perhaps even learning to sing-weave ancestor silk from the Moth Priests themselves."
2,,100CP,Costumer ,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Many objects, especially with regards to armor, place function over form. Now, you don't have to settle for armor that is good but an eyesore. You can take any item you possess and 'overlay' it on top of a similar item, changing the second item's appearance to match the first, while maintaining all of its functionality, protective qualities, etc."
3,,100CP,Needlework ,Earth Girls,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"It wouldn't really be called tailoring, but that's basically what you do. Making thread and basic cloth from scratch, fashioning fur and leather into clothes, and fixing up all the rips and tears the others get running around. The clothing you make is always rugged and neatly made, too."
4,,100CP,Needlework ,Marvel Comics Kid Superheroes,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Being on your own, you've had to learn to make and maintain your costume and gear yourself. You're pretty good at making and repairing clothes, armor and small electronics."
5,,100CP,Talented: Tailoring ,Inukami,Domain: Skills: Clothing,You are an expert at any non-combat related skill. Cooking? You can make a five star meal with low rate ingredients.
6,,200CP,Arachne Silk,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"An endless strand of silk from an Arachne that can be used in making clothes. Clothes made with the silk are extra durable, so that even a wild beast couldn't leave even a tear on them. Stains on the cloth are easy to remove, but magical energies applied to the clothes have a trace of them absorbed and stored inside the clothes, giving off the scent of the energy."
7,,200CP,Coordinated Outfits ,Kingdom of Loathing,Domain: Skills: Clothing,It seems that having a theme to your clothing has increased its power. Either that or everyone's crazy about your sharp outfit.
8,,200CP,Crafting: Tailoring ,Aion SB,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"You have begun learning the basics of the crafting techniques of this world. Each purchase of this perk lets you select a category of crafting from the list below; making you proficient in the basics of that craft. You must choose a different category with each purchase. Your skill in one of your chosen fields is now comparable to those hailed as masters of that profession. This can also be bought multiple times, but each purchase must be used on a different field of crafting."
9,,200CP,Fur is always in ,Earth Girls,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Even though the ice age is over, the winters can still be fiercely cold. The clothes you make are warm or cool as needed, and protect the wearer against the most extreme weather the world can throw at them."
10,,200CP,Putting on the Reich ,Indiana Jones,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"They may fear your tenacity. They may hate your cause. They may even oppose your beliefs. But one thing remains constant: A begrudging respect for the aura of organization and sharpness you give off. You have an excellent sense of how to design uniforms that not only are intimidating and show the power of your group, but are also fashionable and make your group look organized, official in a way. It's time to show them who's Boss."
11,,200CP,Secular Skills ,Red Dwarf,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Through growing up in a society in which religion tried to stem the natural instincts of the cat people towards vanity and good looks, you learned to craft amazing clothes and outfits from the most basic materials and tools, and don't worry they all will look fantastic."
12,,200CP,Spinning Wheel of Arachne ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Taking the form of an old spinning wheel with webs and spiders nesting inside the circle, this relic is a testament to the skill of those who would dare challenge the gods themselves. The spiders within eternally produce silk that is as glamorous as it is tough, letting one weave with a thread that never allows itself to be torn or ripped by normal, mundane means such as fist or blade. In addition, any fabric you attempt to feed the spiders will soon have its traits mixed with the silk, making the spiders create something marvelous."
13,,200CP,The Arachnid's Needle ,Exalted - The Solars,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"The Solar Exaltation was born in the crucible of revolution, intended as a primordial weapon of mass destruction. Yet the peerless artifice of the Great Maker coupled with the perfection of Ignis Divine led to something far more potent. Once the drums of war finally ended their beat, and the fallen titans locked away, many of the chosen found new ways to express their power during peacetime. These new god-kings saw the arts flourish at their hand, the perfection of their essence allowing the creation of unparalleled masterpieces. One such remnant of these lost arts is this needle, created from the spinneret of a titanic primordial behemoth and alloyed with orichalcum. Such a tool was used in the first age to weave some of the finest garments of its time, producing such wonders as a dress woven of crystal and glass, or a suit created from molten rock; thanks to its potent magic, almost any material can be worked with. Its exploits have been known for a millennia, and such constant use has left it with an imprint of its former owner's genius. As such, even the lowliest of craftsmen can create exquisite garments should they wield this needle.
* The imprint of former owner should know how to make stuff with essence which seems useful"
14,,300CP,Blessed By A God:Tailoring ,Everyone Else is a Returnee,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Gain a blessing from one of the recorded gods, gaining a boost in whatever skill or stat they stand for. Additionally, you exemplify that skill or trait, standing heads and shoulders above all others in that field. These gods and goddesses cover just about every domain and aspect there is, from fire to beauty to magic."
15,,300CP,Profession: Tailoring ,World of Warcraft,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Sew cloth armor and many kinds of bags using dye, thread and cloth gathered from humanoid enemies during your travels. Tailors can also fashion nets to slow enemies with, rideable flying carpets, and magical threads which empower items they are stitched into. Zen Master: At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on an even playing field with top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field."
16,,300CP,Stitch by Stitch ,Earth Girls,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"The clothes you make are gorgeous and suited to the person you make them for. They protect both the heart and the body of the person that wears them, sheltering them from physical sickness and 'spiritual' illnesses alike while making the most of their body."
17,,300CP,Super Sea Snails ,Splatoon,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"You have a small breeding population of around 10 Super Sea Snails, large snails with crystalline, conical shells. The snails are hermaphroditic and they live for around 15 years. They're more than they seem, they provide an invaluable service- Their shells can be used to imbue hats, shirts, and pairs of shoes with extra Ability Slots, or reroll the abilities of a clothing item with 3 full slots. This kills the Sea Snail, but if you're careful to keep up the population then eventually you might have an entire wardrobe of 3-slot clothing. Also, they're delicious when cooked right."
18,,350CP,Profession: Leatherworking ,World of Warcraft,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Enchanting, Inscription, Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Engineering, Leatherworking, Tailoring, and Jewelcrafting. Your first purchase is half off and starts you off at an apprentice level. For an additional 50 CP you start off at a Journeyman level with all blueprints of that level and lower. For another 50 CP you will jump up to Expert with all blueprints of that level and lower. For a final purchase of 50 CP you will be an Artisan (the highest level in the game before this system was removed) with all blueprints for your profession(s) that exist within the game."
19,,400CP,Ambient Magic: Thread ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Ambient magic takes different forms depending on the mage and the craft he or she performs. Each Ambient Magic is considered linked to a specific one of the four elements. There are a multitude of different forms of ambient magic, each linked to ages old traditions such as (but not limited to) cooking, dancing, smithing, weaving, animal tending, sailing, building, gardening, farming, and scribing; or to powerful natural forces, such as fire, wind, weather, and so on.
Thread: A form of Earth Magic, it allows the manipulation and enhancement of thread, cloth, and other tools of the weaver or sewer's trade. It is practiced by Sandry and Dedicate Lark. Stitch Witches can enchant bandages to heal wounds, broider veils to hide identities, make clothes that protect like armor or ward away fire, and sew good luck or love charms."
20,,400CP,Battlesuit Tailor ,Honkai Impact Third,Domain: Skills: Clothing,This lets you make custom battlesuits that help people develop better and focus their skills in specialized ways that their powers don't quite match necessarily but are 'close enough'. With enough practice you can make ones that aren't powered by Honkai energy and can be used by anyone.
21,,400CP,Incredibly Talented ,In Another World With My Smartphone,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"There is one area in which you truly shine. Pick a single skill or talent such as hand to hand, swordsmanship, magical innovation, alchemy, or similar focus. You are now, hands down, one of the best people in the world in that subject. An alchemist could come up with all sorts of new alchemical concoctions and potions that would astound and amaze your peers, a swordsman could cut down a hundred men on his own nearly effortlessly, a magical innovator could create new spells or rituals or magical items with unsurpassed vision and creativity, and similar such potency applies to any other skill or focus you take with this perk. Beyond that however you will always be able to refine your focus, allowing you to push yourself to greater and greater heights no matter how skilled you become. You may purchase this perk more than one, but it must apply to a new skill or focus each time it is taken.
* Its a uncapper which is pretty unique and nice"
22,,400CP,Log In Room ,The Weakness Of Beatrice,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"A room connected to your warehouse or a property that you own that seems very similar to the login room you see on entrance to Grounds' Nir, where you would normally equip your Percentage type Gear and customise your colours. This room accomplishes the same thing, providing limitless storage for all your clothing and allowing you to instantly fit on any clothing you own. It can also freely change the colours of any clothing you own as well.
While it cannot create clothing from nothing, it does have two powerful effects. The first, it can turn existing clothes into Percentage Type Gear, giving it percentage based stat boosts that increase depending on how powerful the gear is, usually relating to the gears original purpose.
The second, it allows you to combine existing pieces of clothing into a single piece of gear, combining their effects and appearance. Be warned that Percentage Gear requires you to have enough Willpower to handle it and making something into too strong a Gear piece may result in you being unable to equip it and gain the effects. Clothing made via this room or modified is made from Willpower, allowing you to instantly shed or reequip whatever you are currently wearing even outside of the room."
23,,400CP,Magic Steps ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"You possess a refined beauty, a keen sense of fashion, and an almost ethereal grace. You know almost instinctively how to pick clothing that accentuates features and attributes you want accentuated and hides those you want hidden, and to pick clothing that will be at the height of fashionability and functionality at the same time. Your movements are fluid, graceful, and, when combined with any form of dance, practically spellbinding. Your features are fine, reinforced by good bone structure, with lustrous hair (or scales or feathers) and skin and teeth that practically radiate good health and breeding."
24,,400CP,Sewing and Showcasing Room ,The Incredibles,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"A large room perfect for any sewing or otherwise creating of Super Suits and other clothing. It comes with high tech sewing equipment, an enormous supply of different mannequins, and a gallery for when you want to show off your best designs. Movable seating and extremely durable glass panes included. May be attached to the Warehouse or any of your properties after the jump."
25,,400CP,Sewing Room ,Twokinds,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Just as a cook needs a kitchen and a mage needs a laboratory, a seamstress needs a sewing room! This cozy space contains every tool you'll need to craft beautiful garments and functional clothing. This workshop also comes with a wide variety of fabrics, fasteners, and other supplies you'll need to complete your crafts. Even rare and exotic materials, like drake leather and wyvernsilk, are included in your stockpile."
26,,400CP,Smart Clothing ,Eclipse Phase,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Comprised of programmable fibres, Smart Clothing can alter its shape, cut, style and colour to mimic nearly any outfit, from Tron-like bodysuits with animated glowing panels, to a formal tux complete with tails, flower on the lapel and a handkerchief in the pocket, to going partially or totally transparent in case you wanted to show off your nanotats while working in outer space it's just a matter of programming in a new style. However, the smart clothing remains all one piece no matter how many parts it looks like it has, and making it look like armour or a radiation suit doesn't afford any more protection than its (moderately tough) fibres already do.
Smart Clothing can be combined with an outfit you already own for free, such as your free Light Vacsuit, upgrading it to a Smart Fabric Vac Suit. As you have chosen to upgrade, your suit has all the extra features. The clothing is very heavily armored against both kinetic and energy attacks (easily shrugging off small calibre rounds or a laser pistol), and has a whole host of defensive modifications that make different attack modes (like laser, flame and acid) far less effective. The colour-shifting pattern can give you active camouflage and thermal signature dampening at a moment's notice, and you can even electrically shock anyone in contact with you.
* Smart fabric Vac Suit is essentially a high tech space suit"
27,,400CP,Superhuman Skill: Tailoring Cosmic Level ,Generic Super Academy,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"You possess greater than human levels of skill in a single occupation. You could be a superhuman sniper, martial artist, mechanic, chef, or any other area of skill. You may purchase additional occupations for an extra 100 cp each. At Street Tier you are slightly above what a normal human could achieve. This level in skill is equivalent to Bullseye's accuracy or Lady Shiva's fighting skill. At National Tier you can achieve feats of skill that would normally only be possible with machine-like perfection. You could literally shoot the wings off a fly at 100 meters, perform delicate brain surgery with a shard of glass in a tenth the normal time, or write a song that inspires a national revolution within days. At Global Tier the laws of physics become flexible when you practice your skills. You can bend bullets Wanted style, balance on a cloud, or swim up a rainstorm. At Cosmic Tier things get a little ridiculous. Your skills acquire conceptual level effects. You could shoot someone by targeting their shadow, dodge bad luck, or repair spatial rifts with duct tape and bailing wire."
28,,400CP,Tailor Made | Resolute Thread | Magic | Longevity | Combat Training,Skulduggery Pleasant,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Tailor Made (200CP) You have the knowledge of how to weave magic into clothes, making them incredibly durable and protective. They're capable of protecting the wearer from most things, including bullets, knives, magic, extreme heat, and large amounts of blunt-force trauma. They also look damn stylish.
Resolute Thread (200CP) You have a spool of thread that's supposedly made from the stomach lining of an Emperor Dragon over 2000 years ago. The more pressure applied to it, the stronger it becomes. You could bind a superhuman or use it to hang hundreds of tons off of the ground. Spool refills and used thread once a month.
Magic (0CP) This world’s magic is not exactly what you normally come across. Here everyone (barring one) has a True Name. This name is the source of magic and what allows sorcerers to use magic. Learning someone else’s True Name will allow you to have absolute control over everything they do and vice versa if someone learns yours. The only way to prevent this is to seal your name. On the other hand, learning your own True Name allows a sorcerer to access godlike magic and power. You arrive here with the spark of magic inside you, allowing you to bring it to the surface and wield it as a weapon. Regardless of your chosen Origin, your ability to wield magic and the skill you possess is roughly equivalent to that of a local wielding the same discipline that has lived for about one hundred years.
Longevity (0CP) In this world, magic has a sort of rejuvenating effect, decreasing the speed at which a sorcerer/ress ages. Sorcerers can live for hundreds of years, with some exemplary individuals managing to live for even a thousand. However, barring vampires, this is not immortality; a magic-user will still age and eventually die, with their magic simply slowing the process down.
Combat Training (0CP) This world isn’t like Harry Potter where fighting is always done at a distance and only with magic. Here, sorcerers use every advantage they have to fight, win, and survive. All origins receive training in a single form of combat equal to that of a master of said discipline. The definition of combat training is rather broad, and can cover anything from a specific martial art to swordsmanship to the use of firearms. Now before you get a big head, I should remind you that the majority of the main characters are masters of several martial arts, so do try to be careful."
29,,400CP,The Flock's Fleece ,Actraiser,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Men and women have not wandered the wilds naked since the long-gone days of the Garden. Whether they knew it or not, the act of clothing oneself is one that at once protects and isolates. A shirt or a robe is a metaphorical armor against the elements, against shame and against the prying eyes of others. You are such a skilled craftsman that you can take the 'metaphorical' part out of the equation. You're a one-person clothing creator and tailor, able to take the raw materials of silk, cotton, wool and hide...and then with almost no tools produce wondrous clothing, fitted just right for anyone who dares try the garments on. They're protective vestments against the harsh elements, able to keep people in comfortable condition be they in the deserts of Kasandora or the icy plains of Northwall. Not only that, but people who wear them find that they'll be kept safer from the claws of beasts or the swords of their enemies, acting as a light chain-mail mesh despite being soft and maneuverable fabric."
30,,500CP,Requiem of Souls | Weaver | Silk Spinning ,Jade Cocoon,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Requiem of Souls (200CP) You have been taught the sacred song of the Cocoon Masters, which allows you to soothe a Minion's raging heart. By playing this song to a weakened monster, you can capture it inside of an empty cocoon. The more damaged the creature is, and the more skillful your playing, the more likely you are to capture it. You can play the song again to release them, but by itself the Requiem will not make them loyal to you. This gives you basic proficiency in a musical instrument of your choice.
Weaver (100CP) You are now an expert weaver. Doesn't sound like much, right? Remember that the silk spun from magical creatures' cocoons was so beautiful that King Karis murdered his own son over it. They have some REALLY good silk here in Parel is what I'm saying and you are a master of working with it.
Silk Spinning (200CP) With a prayer to Elhrim, you can purify a Firefly Cocoon (a cocoon filled with a monster using the Requiem of Souls perk above) and spin it into silk. This kills the monster but produces truly breathtaking silk. The stronger the monster, the better quality of silk is produced. The strongest Minions could produce silk fit for a god. Who knows what you could make from the monsters you might find out there on distant worlds?"
31,,600CP,Industry Support ,My Hero Academia,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Every hero currently running around out there has a costume of some kind like a full body badge, and equipment that complements their style or Quirk incredibly. Where did you think all that came from?
When it comes to a career in support, it doesn't matter if no one has heard of you before, you're easily a top dog in the industry. Costumes and equipment alike are your forte and nobody can deny.
Your costumes are form fitting, flattering, stylish and sturdy, easily standing up to the day in day out beating and stress that those who wear them put them through while keeping them looking amazing. More importantly, you're a flat out genius when it comes to this world's technology, making the various gadgets, machines and equipment that can take an okay Quirk to the next level. Elemental powers lacking in range or accuracy? You could design tools for that. Super strength, speed or some other physical ability putting stress on your body? You have the solution. If there's something someone needs to shore up a power's strengths or weaknesses, you can probably think up and build something over the weekend. You'll just need the tools, resources and a healthy dose of imagination."
32,,600CP,The Creator: Tailoring ,Everyone Else is a Returnee,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Pick one area of creation. This could be blacksmithing, cooking, enchanting, or more. You now are the undisputed master of that craft. A blacksmith would be able to make unique and legendary class weapons by the dozen while cooks could make the tastiest food in all the realms, using previously thought inedible ingredients, so good that they may even have special effects like recovering stamina or health, or boosting your stats equivalent to ten levels for several minutes at a time. With time and effort you will only increase in ability, your growth uncapped in that area."
33,,600CP,Unusual Attire ,Wonderland No More,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Wonderland certainly has some unique styles of clothes, with some humans preferring clothing made from paper actual paper, not recycled or mixed with something else! Yet they somehow make it work. You can now make clothes out of any material or substance you want, even if they would normally not work at all for clothing. These clothes will not harm the wearer even if their properties normally would. Even so, the materials retain their other properties, which may prove detrimental in their own way. For example, a glass ball gown would not be at risk of cutting the wearer (and wouldn't actually be that stiff when worn), but it would still be at risk for shattering if directly struck (and the shattered pieces, no longer counting as clothing, could hurt the subject). Or if you had shoes made out of molten lava, the user wouldn't be burned, but they'd set on fire anything else they touched (and that resulting fire could in turn burn the wearer). On the flipside, though, any positive attributes of the materials will also be retained."
34,,600CP,Yet Another Halloween Fic ,Generic Buffy Fanfiction,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"You can now create magical Halloween costumes which enables the wearer to take on the personality and powers of the costume. The total power of all active costumes cannot exceed the power of the one who made them, and they mute any powers the users would otherwise have. You can choose whether or not this overwrites the memories of the user or merely impacts their mannerisms.
CAPSTONE BOOSTED: The costumes may now manifest into their own living forms. The clown make up and purple suit will actually form into The Joker or that pair of cat ears becomes a cat. The form will be true to your vision of the costume. The limit to this is the same as before, all active costumes together cannot exceed your total power. The living costumes and worn costumes are in separate pools though, so you can have one person equal to your power by wearing a costume, as well as one living costume equal to your total power. Regarding living costumes powers, this works per attribute; you may be a million times stronger than a base human, but if you've only got 10x the mental processing power of a base human, you cannot make more than 10 costumes with human level intelligence, or 5 costumes with double human intelligence."
35,,700CP,Tailoring | Life Fibers ,Kill la Kill,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"Tailoring (300CP) You have the knowledge of how to safely work with life fibers, and how to make them into clothing that empowers (or inhibits) the wearer. In addition, because you know how Life Fiber uniforms work, you know their weak spots better than anyone.
Life Fibers (400CP) A medium-sized spool of Life Fiber. It's only enough to maybe make a pair of gloves out of, but with the proper knowledge, one could create Goku Uniforms- Or enhance existing articles of clothing to be like Goku Uniforms. One spool of thread is enough to make several one-star outfits, three two-star outfits, or a single three-star outfit, assuming you have the knowledge of how to work with Life Fibers."
36,,1700CP,"The Sewing Machine | No capes | I used to design for GODS | Sewing and Showcasing Room | And Machine Washable, dahling ",The Incredibles,Domain: Skills: Clothing,"The Sewing Machine (100CP) Now you might be wondering why I'm offering a single sewing machine... That's because this technological masterpiece is the very platonic ideal of a sewing machine. This is the one machine fit to work on designs worn by GODS. Working with this will enhance all your sewing skills to greater heights.
No capes (200CP) They snag on things, get caught in turbines, generally get in the way, and not many people can even pull the caped look off... Too much trouble to be worth it. And likewise, you can pick up on the weaknesses in designs extremely quickly, able to remove them or simply attempt to cover all your bases when you create something. Never again shall you create a suit that will fall short or hinder the wearer.
I used to design for GODS (400CP) And your skill is a testament to that lofty ideal. Designing things to be bold, dramatic, heroic, and just plain look good is as easy as breathing to you. Now the equal of Edna Mode herself, you'll most likely be asked to design for ""super""models in Milan on a regular basis... but it's just not the same, Dahling. Your real skill lies with the Super fashion after all, and Super Suits is what you excel in. To the point that you could even make people look good in spandex.
Sewing and Showcasing Room (400CP) A large room perfect for any sewing or otherwise creating of Super Suits and other clothing. It comes with high tech sewing equipment, an enormous supply of different mannequins, and a gallery for when you want to show off your best designs. Movable seating and extremely durable glass panes included. May be attached to the Warehouse or any of your properties after the jump.
And Machine Washable, dahling (600CP) Of course looking good isn't all there is to a good Suit. It also needs to be very sturdy, comfortable, withstand extreme temperatures, be bulletproof, specialized to complement the wearer's powers, and yet breathe like egyptian cotton. Oh, and be machine washable, that's a new feature. So, it's a good thing that you're able to create specialized Super Suits like these for virtually any kind of powers. Suits that stretch with elastic Supers, that go invisible with an invisible Super, and much more. With time you could even find ways to incorporate armor and electronics into your skin-tight suits. It may not be able to do everything... but it can do a hell of a lot more than it should be able to. And of course you also get the ability to create general technology to help out with your work, like high-tech sewing machines, laser turrets built into ceilings, and bulky invisibility generators…"
