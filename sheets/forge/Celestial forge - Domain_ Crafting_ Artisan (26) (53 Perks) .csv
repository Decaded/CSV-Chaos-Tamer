1,,50CP,Beniemiya ,Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"It might just be something in the water, both what you're drinking and what you serve to the guests that adore every meal you make. You're a savant when it comes to making meals, not just limited to Eastern dishes either. With a little experimentation, you can make almost anything into a mouth watering feast for both the taste buds and the eyes. The real problem isn't making a good meal but keeping all these greedy pigs from eating you out of house and home. Don't even try making hamburgers around any blonde ladies, it never ends well. Now, while cooking good food is a prize well worth it, you do also have a more useful aspect here. By channeling magical energy into your tools and ingredients as you work, you're able to 'enchant' the meal with a variety of useful effects. A hearty beef stew that lets a warrior heal their wounds much faster than normal, sugary sweets that give people the speed of the wind, a mighty hamburger that temporarily bulges the muscles to greater heights. Even negative effects are possible, if you want to taint your food that way. They only last for a temporary period and the effects tend to be fairly weak without a lot of mana put in but it makes your food all the more popular."
2,,100CP,Artisan ,Generic Builder,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You have a talent for creating works of art. Creation times are halved and your natural talent increases with each purchase of this knack. Your artwork has an almost magical ability to invoke a particular emotion that you set at the time of its creation, scary masks, awe inspiring fountains, creepy puppets or such. The degree of emotion-induction effect increases with skill.
* Can be taken indefinitely for creation time modifiers"
3,,100CP,Crafting Artisan ,World of Darkness - Demon the Fallen,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"When it comes to the manufacturing of physical goods, such as blacksmithing, woodworking, basket weaving, etc, you are an expert in dozens of fields. More than that, you have a certain artistic flare to your work that others can't help but notice."
4,,100CP,Craftsman ,Generic Builder,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You have a talent for creating things requiring wood as well as selecting the best wood for the job at hand. Creation times are halved for each purchase of this knack and the results are always visually impressive if you so wish.
* Can be taken indefinitely for creation time modifiers"
5,,100CP,Family Jewels ,Elder Scrolls Online,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You're a certified jeweler, well versed in things like stone cutting, gem polishing, and working with precious metals like copper and gold in a non-martial sense. You can deftly handle any metal up to Rank III (silver) and your knowledge of gemology and the symbolic nature of precious stones could earn you critical acclaim if you continue to hone your skills."
6,,100CP,Guest Artist ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"All the kids have their own style these days. A new way of being drawn, a new way of speaking, something to really make them stand out from all the other Jump characters. You can sell out and join the trend now too! You're able to freely change your art style and speech font to whatever you want, even basing it on some of the classic artist's work of the past. Of course, given how these things are usually designed to be in a manga, appearing very different visually may terrify those around you and different word fonts may make you sound very strange. But isn't it worth it when it makes you stand out to your readers?"
7,,100CP,Lunatic Trickster ,Van Helsing,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You will have peasantry frequently knocking at your door with their torches and pitchforks, adventurers dashing through your laboratories, and your creations frequently trying to escape. Now you can prevent all of this from happening with your knowledge of creating fiendish, murderous traps of all damage ranges & variants! Those not entirely dependent on the environment, such as pitfall traps, can be stored in small silver discs to be used as weapons."
8,,100CP,Shaper ,Age Of Wonders II,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Stone is a tough servant, resisting most ways to work it by unskilled hands. Under your touch, however, it molds itself eagerly, as if it were unable to wait to become the new shapes you wish for it. You are a gifted artisan with the natural materials of the world, and can build fortifications, buildings, and other creations out of wood, stone, sand, and any other such materials with great ease. Indeed, under your touch the materials you work with seem to become greater, somehow - sand and clay toughen to match granite when building a wall, and a carved wooden blade seems to hold its edge like fine steel once you're finished with it."
9,,200CP,Architectural Madness ,Exalted - The Infernal,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Malfean architecture is unlike anything found in Creation, with endless variety and many oddities. Many techniques that were once burned away by She Who Lives in Her Name have been rediscovered. Foremost in these are the techniques to allow demons to build structures that do not need pillars, arches and other support structures. Buildings hundreds if not thousands of feet high can be built without any apparent load-bearing walls or struts. Windows and doors can be placed anywhere without disrupting the integrity of a building.
Of course these techniques work best with the brass and black stone common to Malfeas, even if they work to a lesser extent with other materials. So it is just one more reason most buildings in Malfeas are made of brass and basalt, along with their abundant presence. Yet many more techniques are used by the artisans and architects of Malfeas, even aside from the omnipresent murals, wall carvings, and other ornamentations.
Techniques to create such marvels as buildings that sprout from the ground at unnatural angles and made of polished brass turned a rainbow of colors by a process known only to the most skilled of architects. In many of these techniques you have gained the pinnacle of skill and knowledge, that you might replicate the Demon City's constructions even in other realms. While you might not have reliable access to the materials common to those in hell, you will be able to substitute many other materials for these in your structures. And as a truly talented architect you will find the design and construction of Manses comes just as easily to you, even gleaning some additional power from the conflux of essence it is build upon if you do use these hellish methods."
10,,200CP,Deku Crafting ,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"The Deku are a simple race, but they can still make some fancy items, and now you can too. From well-crafted wooden items, to a large leafy-fan that can manipulate the winds, to a special Deku Copter that can allow for flight, anything made by the Deku can be made by you as well. As a bonus, this skill also translates to an improved skill in shaping trees into houses or other structures, if you so desire."
11,,200CP,Gerudo Crafting ,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You are a Gerudo Craftswoman, with all the skill that implies. You can make clothing for both voe and vai that can keep them cool and even help protect from lightning, fashion gorgeous swords and shields designed to be used by the greatest warriors, and Shock Arrows that encapsulate the fury of the storm itself, releasing a mighty shockwave on impact. Any item made by Gerudo hands can be shaped by yours, so long as you have gathered all needed ingredients."
12,,200CP,If You Want It Done Right ,Lords Of The Night-Liches,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"There's people who leech off of other people's efforts. Herd animals, herbivores the kind of weaklings who fall in line. You aren't one of them. You know the only person whose work you can really trust. A big project can be hard to tackle by yourself. Different resources, different specialities. Even if you know all the different pieces, you might not know how to put all of them together. Even if you know how to put them together, changing tracks and approaches all the time can scuttle your work. There are many extra problems that arise when you go alone, and many problems that are solved simply by having a second pair of hands helping you. None of that applies to you. Unless a problem literally requires a second pair of hands or other such gross physical assets, the work doesn't grow harder for you, simply because you have to do it all yourself. This doesn't make it easier either - if a project requires a thousand man hours of work, then you'll need to put that in. But the lack of help won't make it worse or harder. You can simply do things by yourself, provided you put in the work and the time. And for a lich, whom has all the time in the world? Well, nothing more needs to be said, does it?"
13,,200CP,Master of the Craft ,Generic Zombie Apocalypse,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Why settle for just being great at one type of skilled work? You are THE master of a mundane craft of your choice (something like Locksmithing, Stonemasonry, or Glassmaking). As a true master craftsman you're sure to impress with your work."
14,,200CP,No Escape,World of Darkness - Mortal,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"The isolated, inescapable killing den is a trope of the slasher story, and it's a trope that has more basis in fact than fiction. Many slashers take some isolated space as their lair, fortifying it and riddling it with trap doors, secret hiding places, and most especially reinforced exits to trap their victims inside.
For some, it's an apparently ramshackle old house on a deserted lane, the windows all boarded over and the doors nailed shut. For others it's a disused factory in the industrial district, refitted with the latest steel security doors and electronic locks.
Whatever form it takes, it serves one purpose: trammelling some unfortunate quarry into a confined space from which there is no escape. This Perk represents the ability and skill to construct a proper murder-castle.
Utilizing this perk allows a Slasher to construct buildings and architecture with inbuilt and near invisible traps that serve to maim and prevent escape. Any normal living space can be converted to a deadly death maze with only a few weeks work. But when an individual with this perk constructs a new structure with the intention of making it into such a place of murder, this ability truly shines. Such a building is an impossibly deadly and nearly impossible to escape structure that would confuse even the most intelligent and crafty individuals. Go ahead and re-create H.H. Holmes's boarding house with this if you want."
15,,200CP,Rito Crafting ,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You have the ability of a Rito Craftsman. You are able to craft warm clothing that can help keep out the chill, even when soaring at the highest heights, powerful bows that can be used to fire multiple arrows at once, Fire Arrows which are enhanced with mighty winds to fan their flames hotter and create mightier updrafts, and more. Anything that has been built by a Rito can be recreated by you, given the right resources."
16,,200CP,Shopping list ,The Weakness Of Beatrice,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Mixing for years and years, constantly keeping on the lookout for the next big ingredient to make something really impressive and attention gathering, you've memorised countless recipes already. In fact, you seem to even remember some recipes you're sure you never studied before. Just seeing something is enough for you to understand its recipe. You know the component pieces of whatever you're looking at, though you may not necessarily understand or know what those component pieces are, you will know what the components have as components and so on. You're also aware of what any of the component pieces you have seen can be combined to make, meaning that seeing more things will not only tell you how those things are made but also how to make even more things on top."
17,,300CP,Savant | Wonder Forging Genius ,Generic Exalted,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Savant (100CP) You're a Savant! This means you've got an incredible insight in crafting all sorts of things, from meals, to clothes, to armor, to weapons, to magical devices, and all sorts of other things besides. Even if you've never done something before so long as it's a skill remotely 'craft like' in nature you'll be able to perform it at the level of a (mortal) master. This just represents innate talent, and if you actually focus on developing such skills the normal way you'll quickly outstrip even the best that a mortal craftsman could accomplish, able to make artwork that speaks to the soul (perhaps literally) or armor and weapons of surpassing quality that look like show-room pieces despite being suitable for combat and also being sturdy and reliable to a frankly unbelievable degree. Purchasing this will even make you substantially better than other Exalted craftsmen, assuming you put in the same amount of effort that they did.
Wonder Forging Genius (200CP)Your crafting abilities need to be seen to be believed. From your hands pour forth miracles given form, works of art of peerless and breathtaking magnificence, works of culinary delight that would leave Emperors sullen at the thought that no other foods could compare, weapons that could last hundreds of years of constant use that would leave men feeling honored to have been slain by them, all these and more take shape under the guidance of your hands. You would be welcomed in any land and by any court for the sheer quality of your work, and you will quickly gain national, if not worldwide, fame for your creations if you bother to advertise them at all.
The least of your creations are superior to anything a mortal master might create, and even the simplest and least adorned of your works will be possessed of unmatched efficiency, resilience, and simple elegance.
Purchased with the Savant perk this is taken to an even grander height, leaving even the crafts of other Exalted looking as pale and shameful imitations by comparison, assuming you put forth the same effort they did in learning your base crafting abilities."
18,,300CP,Crafting ,Divinity - Original Sin,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Crafting is a wide skill that covers everything from simple cooking all the way to magical arrowheads and amulets. Despite this, it is not precisely a trade all on its own. It represents the bits and pieces of useful item creation that some adventurers pick up by dabbling in all the trades at once. You won't be master chef or an expert enchanter, but you don't really have to be either to create something useful.
Novice (100CP) - By studying with a variety of craftsmen for a few weeks at a time, either due to an inability to focus or a desire to obtain a general knowledge base, you've cobbled together your own set of skills and have figured out how to combine items in odd ways. Sewing taught you how to make a doll, while alchemy allowed you to grind down a certain plant into magical dust. You by combining the two, you can create a Voodoo Doll that causes pain to the one you throw it at. This is, of course, just one example of what you might be able to come up with.
Adept (300CP) - With experience comes a certain, subtle awareness that there are more ways to use your talents than you have been up until now. Tossing an oil filled bottle with a flaming rag on top might be enough to get the job done, but there are certainly better ways to go about it. Perhaps if you slipped an Essence of Fire into the mix. Or perhaps nails! Or both! You'll find that you can not only spot new combinations of items you would not have expected but that your creativity in general has received a substantial boost.
* It is impossible for me to fit everything you can possibly make with Crafting into any kind of sensible, readable form. It could very well be its own supplement. So have a link instead. http://www.seth-dehaan.com/divinity_crafting/
* a. Novice Crafting allows you to make anything listed at Rank 0, 1, or 2 Crafting.
* b. Adept Crafting allows you to make anything listed at Rank 3, 4, or 5 Crafting.
* c. These are just examples of what you could make. Feel free to experiment."
19,,300CP,Crafting Genius ,Final Fantasy XI,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You are adept with using the synthesis system to create any items or consumables which adventurers use on a regular basis, such as armor and potions. To a lesser extent, this also makes you a jack of all trades when it comes to mundane means of crafting similar items. Your work tends to be of high quality relative to the rest of the setting."
20,,300CP,Craftsman ,Lord of the Rings - Twilight of the North,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You have been educated in the working of metal, stone, and other materials used by Men in their arts. You can fashion swords and armor of good quality, repair your existing armor, design a building or plan the sewage system for a city. Sketch out and lead the construction of defensive walls, or some great palace fit for a mighty king. You could start with naught but the clothes on your back and in a few years be working for a king, or even build a city of your own, as your variety of skills and quality of craftsmanship will draw apprentices to you like moths to flame."
21,,300CP,Craftsman ,Renegade Immortal,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Building and crafting things is an omnipresent facet of civilization. Utensils, furniture, homes and everything else, they all need people to build them. It's the same for cultivators, though the sheer length of time they live tends to mean that everyone picks up some skills here and there. When they actually devote time and effort towards mastering crafting though? The results are beyond belief.
For 100CP, you have the talent and skill of a mortal master in an area of your choosing, such as smithing, carving, painting, sculpting or similar things. The things you can create with this skill are beautiful and functional enough to draw admiration from mortal emperors and kings. Mortals receive a free purchase of this perk.
For 200CP, you have transcended the realm of mortal talent in all areas of craft and can sculpt statues so accurate to the real thing that they possess a shadow of the aura produced by the real thing and paintings so evocative that they can drive a man to tears or uplift him for the rest of his life. Beautiful weapons that never dull and do far more damage than they should and treasures that would be the envy of any lower realm cultivator. Mortals can buy this level for 100CP.
For 300CP, you have the sheer level of talent and vision necessary to match, and eventually outclass Esteemed Tian Bao, the most famed craftsman of the collapsed Celestial Realm from ages gone by who was responsible for the God Slaying Chariot, an attempt to create a peerless weapon that was surprisingly successful in the end. While you're not there yet, with time, experimentation and the right materials, you could create similarly powerful treasures, artifacts or pieces of art, things that would attract the attention of Third Step cultivators. Mortals can buy this level for 200CP."
22,,300CP,Creating Prisons ,Irredeemable/Incorruptable,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You are a master of the art of crafting prisons. While limited by your means your imagination has no such restraint. Whether crude prisons where your prisoners are kept in place through brutality or a Super-Max with gravity generation comparable to half that of a black hole available on demand or magnificent stellar prisons (or asylums if you wish) with the facility hidden within a star. All of these and more you find easy to come up with the initial idea, design and build with minimal testing and great speed while still building a reliable sturdy and enduring structure. Your prisons will be by default extraordinarily secure unless you undermine that for whatever reason."
23,,300CP,Shop Owner ,ARIA,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Aqua isn't all about the Undine you know, and having merchants around is important to keep things running smoothly, especially on a planet like Aqua, where the majority of society has chosen a more traditional lifestyle in contrast to those who reside on Manhome. As a shop owner, you'll have your own shop of course for the duration of your stay here, which will be regularly stocked with a variety of goods. If you choose a specialized craft like bread making, wine fermenting, glass blowing, or so forth, you'll also develop a strong proficiency in this field something that you can teach to others. Naturally as a shop owner, your abilities to interact with others and develop relationships with them improves can't really be successful without that now, can you?"
24,,300CP,Soft Physics ,Generic Builder,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You have a touch of madness in your soul, your creations often make physics cry. Or maybe you're some sort of comic book style super-genius, with a device or invention for seemingly every occasion? Regardless, the things you make have a lot more leeway in just what they can do, thanks to not necessarily needing to obey silly things like 'physical laws', 'thermodynamics', or similar. As with all Builder related powers just how far you can stretch this depends mostly on how skilled you are and how long you've been developing your abilities.
"
25,,300CP,Workshop Artisan ,Bloodborne,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"As if taught at the long gone workshop, you seem to possess knowledge and skill with many of their crafting techniques. You have been granted the knowledge and skills needed to both repair and even create your own Trick Weapons and Hunter's Tools.
Trick Weapons are weapons with a variety of special abilities relating to their form. The most common type of Trick Weapons are those that can transform in some manner. An example being swords that can lock into specialized sheaths in order to become different weapons, sometimes radically so. Not to say transformation is the only ability, there are also melee weapons with guns attached, and maces that can be charged with unnatural blue electricity to deal massive damage.
Hunter's Tools are pieces of equipment with special abilities activated by using Blood Bullets or Quicksilver Bullets as a medium. Hunter's Tools are usually supernatural items that have been made to work using a Blood/Quicksilver Bullet medium, such as the Beast Roar, a beast's claw that when activated, allows the wielder to roar like a beast.
Some Hunter's Tools are completely man made as well, though this is a relative minority. Basically, you now know how to convert things into being activated and powered by Blood Bullets and Quicksilver Bullets. Doing so allows anyone to use them, even if they are completely mundane beings, so long as they have the bullets mentioned above on their person. When making Hunter's Tools, remember that the more power something requires, the bullets the wielder will need. These skills granted to you may be honed over time, just as any other skill can."
26,,400CP,Core Tuning ,MOUSEHUNT,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"When hunters were focused on tackling the mouse problem around Gnawnia, there wasn't much of a need for trap variety. The mice around Gnawnia are simple critters, and even a simple mallet trap would work against them. But then the problem was suppressed, and hunters began moving to different regions. This led to them encountering mice for which the traditional mousetrap was utterly ineffective, marking the beginning of an arms race with no apparent end.
Whether you're working on a project for a friend or for personal use, this allows you to modify a very specific property, the power type. Seen as an elemental affinity of sorts, this property is key to making tools effective under a wide range of circumstances. The traditional Physical trap doesn't do all that well against ghostly entities, but Shadow traps tend to work well. Arcane traps excel against magical entities, but certain mice are too strategically minded that they specifically require Tactical traps in order to be bested.
There are nine different power types which can be cycled through. Physical, Tactical, Shadow, Arcane, Hydro, Forgotten, Draconic, Parental, Law and Rift. Most of these are rather straightforward except for the extremely esoteric ones like Forgotten (intended for eldritch entities...like the Old One Mice), Law (intended for criminals and outlaws) and Parental (intended for effectively anything that isn't an adult). It's important to note that this modification is more akin to an addition rather than a replacement. Existing elemental affinities on the target item are unaffected by this. You could take what is potentially a Physical Trap and give it Arcane properties."
27,,400CP,"Crafting: Cooking, Handicrafting ",Aion SB,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You have begun learning the basics of the crafting techniques of this world. Each purchase of this perk lets you select a category of crafting from the list below; making you proficient in the basics of that craft. You must choose a different category with each purchase. For an included upcharge, Your skill in one of your chosen fields is now comparable to those hailed as masters of that profession. This can also be bought multiple times, but each purchase must be used on a different field of crafting."
28,,400CP,Fairy Talent: Art ,Peter Pan,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You are constantly inspired to produce various works of art, but your greatest strength lies in painting. For you, painting is not merely a physical skill, but a magical one, as you can literally determine the color of things by painting them. Any change you make to a target’s color becomes its true, permanent color unless you use a new paint. The colors will also enhance certain traits and strengths of the subject depending on the symbolism; for instance, blue embodies depth and stability, while orange represents joy and excitement. And if the colors should belong on something else, it can become that thing; for instance, painting stripes on a horse makes it a zebra, and painting a dome brown or white could turn it into an earthy hill or an igloo respectively. This ability also allows you to change the seasons by painting leaves either green or orange; once you paint enough of them the same color, the world will conclude that it must be time for that season and change accordingly."
29,,400CP,Heavenly Artificer Understanding ,Exalted - The Sidereals,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"The archives of Heaven still record the hidden lore of the First Age, which once raised magitech cities across Creation. You have studied all these under the tutelage of maker-gods of each mortal craft. This has made you a master of creating everything from swords to bridges to liquors to poems. You will also experience certain inspirations, strange moods that will guide you to make some specific object. If you do create it, you will eventually find yourself in a situation where it was exactly what you needed."
30,,400CP,Mad Science ,Generic Wretched Hive,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You have a very particular obsession, and are very good at adapting other devices and discoveries to fit your theme. Things like bombs, guns, vat-grown monsters, mutation-inducing formula...anything suitably diabolical is a valid choice. Translating 20th-century tech into your chosen field and bringing it up to comic-book levels is child's play. Acid grenades? Guns that shoot swords? Thermite bullets? Subliminal messages that make people fly into a violent rage? Any of those can be done with a decent lab and an afternoon's work. More advanced science will take far more effort to integrate, should you get ahold of some more exotic materials."
31,,400CP,Mythic ,Irish Mythology,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Whether you call them gods or fairies, the Children of Danu are just so much more, in many ways. They drink more, eat more, laugh more, love more. This perk brings a similar sense of epicness to your life, improving to at least some degree all other perks as you fight harder, sing better, see deeper and craft better items.
More, it adds some more... abstract qualities. An ordinary warrior cannot batter a howling storm into submission, or punch someone so hard cows give virgin birth hundreds of miles away. But with this perk, you can. A humble smith cannot make a bow from the rainbow or catch a maiden's sigh and sharpen it to literally cut to a man's heart. With this, you can. It's a new and altogether more legendary way of seeing and interacting with the world."
32,,400CP,Swordsmith ,Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"What else shows the spirit of the Japanese but the famed katana blade? Such a central part of their mythos as to have the most famous craftsmen become like heroes themselves. No matter how great, they do not remember the makers of armor or shields like they do artisans of the blade. On the level of legends like Masamune and Muramasa, you are one of these legendary swordsmiths. Even in an ordinary forge with ordinary metals, you can smith katana of a supernatural quality. Edges that split magical steel and blades that don't shatter after a thousand strikes on rock. Often, these even have magical effects if you intend them, such as sharpening as they drink more blood or cutting at a much greater distance than just the physical blade. Should you have access to tools, materials and even magic of a greater level, you will be able to create far greater weapons. Weapons that bring ruin to armies, that cut castles in two with a single slash, fiery tools that send billowing tides of flame to swallow whole forests. When truly inspired, you can even create things on a divine level, the stuff of legends that only a divinity could normally craft. A sword that splits the fabric of reality itself in two, perhaps. With time, your talents may be able to be applied to any form of blade, not just Japanese swords. Should you gain magic of your own, you will see that imbuing those effects into your weapons is effortless, even magnifying the potency of your spells greatly beyond what you would normally be able to cast if you place them into the form of a sword."
33,,400CP,The Legendary God-forging Craftsman ,Against The Gods!,Domain: Crafting: Artisan," There are a lot of things in this world that go beyond martial cultivation and powering up. Sound Transmission Talismans, Profound Arks, armors and weapons, medicinal pills and teleportation formations, and so much more. And you can shake the world in all these fields. You are now an absolute, unbelievable genius at all such 'support' fields. An enchanter, smith, alchemist and formation designer without peer, your mind miles ahead of even the greatest of your would-be competitors, and ideas flow like water. You only need to look at any item, pill, weapon or formation, to know it to the innermost depths, every trick involved in making it, every flaw and potential for improvement, and how to bring them to reality. In future worlds too, your skills translate perfectly, granting you knowledge and skills in the local variations of these things equal to what you leave the previous world with."
34,,600CP,Anartist ,SCP Foundation,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"No, not, ""an artist,"" an anartist, or, ""anomalous artist,"" is someone that, through a variety of means, can create anomalies, typically as a form of artistic expression. Music, sculpture, painting, these and more are ways to create anomalous objects, including sentient or even sapient objects. You need not be an artist to be an anartist; you could simply be someone like Doctor Wondertainment who makes anomalous objects. Speaking practically, you're only able to make Safe- or Euclid-class objects, however, and all objects are likely to have some form of side-effect; the stronger the object, the more likely it is for that side-effect to be potentially deleterious, unless extreme care and counter-measures are taken, especially if it's very quickly put together. Expect objects that are completely clear of side-effects to take around ten times as long as normal to complete, compared to things that have a normal, if somewhat cumbersome, side-effect. It's assumed that most people that make incredibly powerful anomalies die in the process, at some point. These anomalies can take any form, though it's best if their form follows their function."
35,,600CP,"Break The Door, Wrench The Lock, Smash The Door-Posts, Force The Doors",Lords of the Night - Zombies,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"The thing about necromancy, that you've come to understand, is that it's a door. A door leading to more necromancy, and it's increasingly horrible revelations all the way down that recursive road. You can start it off. Perform an act of necromancy that leaves a mark - a village eaten by zombies, a breach between the Material Plane and the Negative Energy Plane, the creation of a particularly powerful free-willed undead...
And you can seize control over a 'door' that now exists in your spirit. The bigger the necromantic mark, the more that was sacrificed, the more potent the forces created or unleashed, the greater the door. That door can be opened, once.
That door can be opened, once.
*To either greatly empower a single act of necromancy.
*To necromantically empower you in a specific, limited, but permanent way. For example, permanently empowering a single spell, power, or similar effect you can invoke with a necromantic blessing.
*Gain a new spell, power, or similar. Spells gained this way are cast like a good aligned clerics spontaneous cure spells.
*As fuel to create an epic spell.
*The ability to cast extra epic spells per day, as long as they’re ‘appropriate’ to the dark forces you gained them from.
*A wish granted. Not as the spell, as a favor paid. Coin of value from the dark forces.
And yes, the power from a door can empower you to greater necromantic heights, so that you can create another greater door, from which you can gain better benefits."
36,,600CP,Carpenter Ant ,SimAnt,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"A lack of hands or other manipulators is little more than a playful challenge for you now when it comes to crafting. This won't help you build computers out of stones but it will assist in shaping and sculpting simple structure and tools from the material available to you. Materials seem to just crack, chip, splinter and mold into whatever simple shape you want as long as you apply the effort and intent."
37,,600CP,Create the Heavens and the Earth ,The Magician - TV show,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"You are a creator first and foremost. While most Deities simply reside over creations, you create them and more. With this perk your ability to ""create"" is massively boosted, and when it comes to creating things your accuracy in doing so, being through divine powers or through mundane practice, is astounding to say the least.
Regardless of your Origin, you gain the ability to create any object, mundane or Magical, if you're normally able to create Magical items or enchant the things you're trying to make without this ability that is, that's the size of or smaller than the average Human, assuming you're willing to foot the cost in the Magical energy it would take to make the base mundane item and fuel the enchantments needed.
This perk cannot reproduce things that require other esoteric methods of payment in the enchanting or creation process of a Magic item, such as the expenditure of experience, the usage of souls, or the power of love.
This process can take anywhere from milliseconds to around ten seconds depending on the size of it and how Magical it is. Any existing abilities that allow you to create things are significantly boosted in potency, and anytime you bequeath any of your internal energies in some way to another it is incredibly boosted in potency, to the point where if you were a Deity and you gave someone a part of yourself to consume for temporary power, you could decide for it to instead boost them to near Deity levels for a short duration instead of the average Master Magician boost people normally get from such an action."
38,,600CP,Doctor Stylish ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Styles are quite special, even among Skills. Makeable, if you know the right way, and capable of just as much power and even some things Skills cannot do. You're a Stylist equal to Fukurou, the creator of Styles, himself. Just by constantly using, considering and playing with a certain phrase, idiom, way of using words or other word-related game, you can create new styles. Things on the level of Provocation Style might take just a few weeks whilst a mid-level style like Label User or Kanji user might take months of repetition. The high level stuff can take years or even longer to make, such as Contradictory Conjunction, but is still possible if you are patient and uninterrupted in your work. You'll also find that you effortlessly master any sort of word-based supernatural power, possessing much more strength than any of your peers would with the same sorts of powers at your normal Level.
Capstone Boosted: The next step of Styles is to take them from being original to converting other things into Styles. You're able to create new Styles by converting existing power and abilities you have into Styles, though this does not remove the original version of the power. The power will still require any energy or material costs as normal and possesses most of the same drawbacks but any sort of physical action required or time requirement is reduced to just a few words needing to be spoken by you. You could be able to cast any of your fire spells simply by saying Fire with different inflections and tones or unleash barrages of blasts of kinetic forces by reciting technique names from martial arts."
39,,600CP,Exalted Ways Dominance ,Generic Exalted,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"As one of the Dragon-blooded you were trained from birth to excel in the areas in which you showed talent, and you showed a great many talents indeed. Choose any seven of the following - War, Melee, Martial Arts, Archery, Thrown, Riding, Sailing, Socializing, Athletics, Awareness, Dodge, Bureaucracy, Crafting, Integrity, Investigation, Larceny, Linguistics, Lore, Medicine, Occult, Performance, Presence, Stealth, Survival, or Resistance. You are now the undisputed master of those seven skills. This is in addition to any skills or abilities you would normally be good at on account of your Caste or 'favored' choices.
You can do things with the seven skills you have chosen while half drunk and blind on your worst day that the greatest mortal practitioners would never be able to replicate, even on their best day, in their entire lives. Additionally you can train anyone that you personally tutor in these seven abilities and they will quickly reach a level of skill close to, but just short of, your own level of skill. They will learn at a rate equivalent to an Exalt so long as you personally teach them, even if they aren't an Exalt.
If you chose Dodge you might one day be able to walk through a rainstorm without getting wet. If you choose Archery you might strike a man's heart from over the horizon while he is standing in the middle of a forest. If you chose Bureaucracy the sheer efficiency and speed with which your organization operates will baffle even the most astute observers and leave competitors hopelessly scrambling to catch up. Choosing Medicine might allow you to perform brain surgery with a rusty knife using only one hand, and have the patient come out the other side perfectly healthy. Point blank the things you can manage with your chosen skills would be outright impossible for nearly anyone else to replicate, even other Essence users needing to 'cheat' and use Charms in order to match what you can do with nothing but your own innate talent. You may purchase this perk up to three times, each time it is purchased you must select different abilities."
40,,600CP,Forging The Spear of Destiny ,Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 1,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"To strike down evil, one must wield the appropriate weapon. It is for that cause, of aiding not only your fellows but the next generation who will live long past your own end, that you have taken the blacksmithing techniques of the Dragunity clan to a new level. Forging innately magical weapons, capable of summoning minor firestorms or striking with flensing wind, is simplicity itself for you. But where you truly shine is in the forging of power itself. Rendering a bolt of lightning into a spear, quenching shaped magical energy until it is a fine rapier, or even extracting the necrotic energies within an undead and refining it into an arrowhead, are all possible with some work. However, you are not limited to such easily visible forms of power. Should they cooperate, or prove incapable of resisting, you may forge a person's very power into a magical item reflecting their nature and capabilities. Perhaps even pool the power of multiple persons into a single weapon even greater than them although, it's not an idea you've had the chance to test, sadly. Parting with one's power forevermore is something not many can seriously consider."
41,,600CP,Incredibly Craftsmanship ,Akame ga Kill,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"While the method of creating Teigu is long lost you are able to create things almost at their level, with some research and a couple other skilled people you might even be able to recreate the lost arts that created the Teigu long ago. You also have all the skills to repair Teigu or other incredible items from near destruction."
42,,600CP,Magma Blacksmith ,Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Breaking the enemy in half with your bare hands and setting fire to anyone who tries to stop you works just fine for most Lavals, but that's no excuse to slack off when it comes to making weapons. Besides learning any kind of blacksmithing twice as fast as your peers, you're already a living legend. You can forge obsidian swords that cut straight through solid steel even when swung by a child, and your suits of stone armor would let people comfortably walk inside an erupting volcano or trek through a raging snowstorm. But you're not letting yourself stop there. With a special quenching technique wherein you use a lava flow instead of water or oil, you can reinforce any material or equipment capable of withstanding the required temperatures, improving physical qualities like hardness or sharpness thrice over."
43,,600CP,Matching and Mixing ,The Weakness Of Beatrice,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"If Mixing combines different ingredients to create new objects, like combining various plants to make powerful healing potions, what happens when you combine two or more of the same thing? Normally, nothing, it's a total waste of ingredients. It's not entirely impossible to find a way past that limitation and when you found that way, you rocketed past it to new heights of crafting power. You're able to combine multiples of the same thing to increase its overall power and utility. This can range from combining many corpses of the same being to create a super strong golem under your command to combining many Shining Weapons into one Frankenstein weapon that can channel an unholy shit-load of power at once."
44,,600CP,Non-Euclidean Mind ,Generic Creepypasta,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Unique insight into the nature of reality has given you the somewhat troubling ability to bend space, or at least build structures that bend space. You can build things like buildings that are much bigger on the inside than their exterior would suggest, tunnels and halls that cross continents, even a series of connected spaces that randomly move you between them whenever you enter a door. The limiting factor is that you'd need to spend the same amount of resources as constructing the actual structure would be, although thankfully you won't need to spend as much time; a bigger on the inside house would use the amount of materials that the bigger insides suggest, for example. In addition, your twisted mind helps protect from mind reading, as your mind is as labyrinthine as your creations."
45,,600CP,Omni Crafting ,The Weakness Of Beatrice,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Most Support classes are limited to one general area of work. Healers mix potions and medicines, constructors mix buildings and fortifications, smiths mix weapons and armour. Command and Passive spells only apply to your specialty, just like how someone who trains to become a blacksmith won't get any better at painting or drawing up building plans. You're some kind of Omni-Support class that not just ignores these limits, it shatters the very idea that you'd be so limited. Your crafting and Mixing abilities in one area can be used for any form of crafting or Mixing. Abilities that would normally improve the potency of your potions instead improve the power of your created weapons and vice versa. This also applies to your raw skills, allowing you to use skills in one crafting/creative discipline for other areas of work. That said, the skill scaling is a little weaker, in that only very broad specialties will carry over the full effect, while more specific forms of creating things gives a small benefit to other skills."
46,,600CP,Programming Miracles ,Alterworld 2.4,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"The metaphysics of this world allow for some interesting things to happen. Creating a fully realized dimension with its own malleable laws and rules is something common place though such a thing was never intentional. The Perma Effect caused many new worlds to spring into being from the playgrounds of humanity, video games become more than their intended distractions from reality and become real in themselves all through the power of belief and the divine spark of a human soul. By buying this perk you can take a little of this divinity with you, you become an able game designer and programmer. Someone who could create entire worlds from scratch with amazing amounts of detail. People would be astounded to see the worlds you create. This on its own is amazing but that is not all, by merely getting enough people to willingly play your game in your world you can slowly split it off into its own self contained world. The numbers are not low, requiring a large amount of people to play for extended amounts of time before your world begins to go from unreal to real. A minimum of 200,000 souls all playing in your world all believing in it and wishing it was real will be your lower threshold for such a feat, that is your minimum threshold to start an unreal world down its path become a real world of its own. Surely you can pull that off, yes? You can toggle this effect if you wish to simply craft some of the best games around and not have them become miniature world of them own I guess. If you were into that."
47,,600CP,Sacrificial Smith ,Overlord - Games ,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"If there is a tradition between all those Overlords and what they did, then that is using minions to empower whatever they forge, usually by having those that just spawned jump in the smelter in order to empower what is gonna be crafted. And you can not only do the same thing, so long you sacrifice minions in some way that involves the crafting process of what you are making.
"
48,,600CP,Sublimation ,Fate/Legends - Vive La France,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Originality and uniqueness may certainly be the king of the high class art world but that's only when people can tell it's there. If not, a revision works just as well. Sublimation is the name of this capability you now have, which allows you to reproduce objects you have a chance to study and 'revise' them in the process, like stealing and rewriting a play.
You'll need the desired item as a catalyst but this will let you slowly make copies of it, quality depending on the time and resources you invest into each one. A few hours is usually all it takes but already powerful items can take expensive, rare or dangerous to acquire materials to remake. More uniquely, your revision ability allows you to alter these catalysts. Again, basing the extent of the effect on time and resources, but you can certainly make a magical sword several times as powerful or add numerous new abilities to it, altering it's history or composition so that it always had those qualities.
Perhaps a cart of raw materials from the local town square is all it'd take to take an ordinary iron blade and make it sharp enough to cut metal and alight in flame on command. But improving an already legendary blade like Durandal even moderately could take fortune's worth of materials that would already be difficult to attain, even for a king. There is not technically a limit on how far an object may be revised, though the cost of doing so will continue to grow greatly. Of course, selling your reproductions and revisions would certainly help build the fortune needed for something big."
49,,600CP,"Titanic Mind, Tiny Body ",The Circumstances Leading to Waltraute's Marriage,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"It's rare that the dwarves let one of their grandmaster craftsmen out into the world. You must just be that special. You're a master unmatched by all but a tiny few at crafting all manner of magical and mundane objects, most of your peers being dwarves like yourself. Gungnir, Mjolnir, Gleipnir, these legendary objects and more are some of the things you could make, provided the time and resources were available. You are equally skilled at modifying already existing things too, finding it no different to add more onto an item than if you were making it from the ground up, even if it was already a complex mechanism. Lastly, all that you make carries a powerful dwarven curse that will afflict and harm any who use it without your permission, even those on a Divine level. This curse will cause terrible ailments and sicknesses to the trespasser until they have properly repented to you."
50,,600CP,World's Maker | Pandora's Child ,Campione,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"World's Maker (0CP) Chant: My inspiration is unending. My creations are peerless. My tools are unrivaled. My hands shall give birth to perfection only. For of all makers I reign as supreme Effect: Three effects come into play when this Authority is called forth. First, the user's creativity will be elevated to top even the greatest of artists, for the purpose of designing what he chooses to create. Second, a set of tools shall appear, perfect for whatever creation the user wanted to make. Third, the user shall gain temporary knowledge of magic to enchant, curse or bless his creation as he had envisioned. Be it buildings, songs, weapons, armor or the likes, even with the worst materials something that borders the divine can be made. Downsides: The user must have something he wants to make before calling the Authority. The materials are not provided for this. Depending on the creation, the time spent making it will vary. Once a project has been started, the Authority won't let another start until the first is done.
Pandora's Child (600CP) Ah, the Campione, the unrivaled humans that managed the impossible: to slay a deity by themselves. They are Pandora's adopted children and the owners of a few advantages. Now, you're one of them too. As a Campione, you gain an all around stronger body, grant you a natural talent to understand any language, an increase in mana that would make even the most untalented into a rival for a Paladin and a natural Magic Resistance that rivals the Gods themselves, making all mortal magic basically useless against you and greatly diminishing the magical attacks from Gods or other Campione. Also, your body will become near ageless, also having an accelerated healing and gaining magic senses if you didn't have them before. All in all, you could say that it improves everything about your body, not to mention that you also gain [Authorities] from any God you slay. Don't get too lazy because of this, I must warn you, many Campiones have fell after relying too much on their natural advantages, since there are ways to go around them."
51,,700CP,Hammer And Anvil | Gimmick and Trick | Fire and Ice ,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Hammer And Anvil (100CP) It'd hardly be right to call you a smith if you couldn't even bang out a piece of metal, eh? You're a seasoned blacksmith, able to work metal and create all manner of useful metal objects - horseshoes, charms, and emblems...and of course, weapons and armor. The weapons and armor you create are reliable and easy to make, the kind used by Travelers and Soldiers all around Hyrule.
Gimmick and Trick (200CP) Arrows are a vital resource, not in the least because they are simple and easy to adjust. With your help, the humble arrow can go from a projectile to a problem solver! You now know how to make the 'trick' arrows utilized in Hyrule, the elemental arrows of fire, lightning and ice as well as the explosive bomb arrows. If you wished, you could extend this tinkering habit to non-projectiles, allowing you to create gimmick weapons and tools similar to that created by Kilton, proprietor of the Fang and Bone. In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil, the quality of your crafted items is increased - allowing you to craft weapons of the quality of non-Hylian special weapons such as the Drillshaft or Gerudo Scimitar, or the quality of the weapons used by the Knights of Hyrule.
Fire and Ice (400CP) The mark of a true journeyman of the trade, you have learned how to infuse elemental properties into the weapons you've forged, as well as create the entirely elemental weapons known as Rods. Though both of these require some 'infused' mystical energy to make, once forged anyone can wield them. In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil and Gimmick and Trick, your crafting expertise is now such that you could create weapons worthy of the Royalty of Hyrule itself, granted to their guardians or rewarded to those who have shown great skill as a hero - yet nothing quite unique. Not yet."
52,,1100CP,Builder Package Tier One | Tier Two | Tier Three | Fragment of the Dream,Generic Island Castaway,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Builder Package Tier One (100CP) Wood and other plant life. You are an exceptional builder with these and know the characteristics of such materials at a glance, you can also form mental blueprints and interact with them as if you actually saw them in the real world to assist in construction, as well as making infallible mental checklists of materials with exact steps, materials, and dimensions needed for the build, you also have an easy time locating useful materials you need for building and you take less time to build than you should.
Builder Package Tier Two (200CP) Stone and crystals, you may now treat the builder package tier one as if it applies to these as well. You are also exceptionally good at locating and harvesting your needed materials while maximizing their yield and minimizing lost or damaged materials.
Builder Package Tier Three (400CP) Metals and processed chemicals, treat these as if they also applied to the first two tiers, in addition to everything you construct now being far more durable than it would otherwise seem and taking less materials to construct than it should, you can also refine them to modern standards despite primitive conditions and lack of equipment.
Fragment of the Dream (400CP) You carry within you a fragment of the God that dreamed up this island, boosting all the perks that you have purchased here. All purchased Builder tiers are boosted to supernatural levels, tier one now allows you to let others see your mental blueprints and cuts construction time to a fraction of what it should be, tier two now allows you to harvest larger amounts of the given materials then are physically present and causes the material site to slowly repair itself over time and tier three now allows you to apply desired characteristics to materials and construct things as if you had tools even if you don't."
53,,1200CP,Mastercraft | Of the Elder Blood ,The Witcher Novels,Domain: Crafting: Artisan,"Mastercraft (700CP) What separates a Master from an Apprentice? No, not the fact that the current Master married his teacher's only daughter and inherited his position in the guild. A True Master of his craft is person whose work is akin to art. Perhaps even the Art snobbish sorcerers like to call their magic, because when someone looks at what was made by your hand they cannot believe it is not magic. When someone thinks about your chosen profession your name is often found to be synonymous to it.
Not surprisingly the rich and powerful will easily agree to outrageous prices to own what you make. This is what it is to be the Master, but there is more, for you are gifted with talent for organization. Your subordinates always perform to the best of their abilities and always remain very loyal to you. Your businesses don't suffer from misfortune, working like well-oiled mechanisms as long as their focus is on your craft. They need so little oversight that you can spend your time on other pursuits almost without worry for your business.
Eventually every master will take an apprentice, or several, and you can fully teach them what you know about your chosen art, almost regardless of how inept they are. They may not be able to surpass you but your legacy will live on through them and their work, and the work of their students and beyond, forever immortalizing your name. Even if history may not remember your other deeds expect to become a folklore hero in the future.
Oh, and good news to you who are Gnomes! You are now also a master metallurgist and have mastered the art of Gwyhyr blades, which are known to be among the greatest weapons ever forged on the continent, with each blade being a masterful work of art. Those unfortunate enough not to be Gnomish may also gain this understanding of their metallurgy and metalworks.
Of the Elder Blood (500CP) It appears that you are an unaccounted for relative of Ciri, by way of Laura Dorren, being an active carrier of the Elder Blood, as it seems that you can travel in the local multiverse; from shifting through time and space to crossing through worlds like stepping through a door, though your control over your ability is rather crude and in dire need of training before it becomes useful. But be wary, refining such a gift is a dangerous process, for the worlds are filled not just with wonders but horrors as well - how else do you think the monsters that witchers hunt appeared, other than when the worlds collided long ago?"
