1,,100CP,Oblation to Onsi ,Elder Scrolls Online,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"From separating the low-carbon steel from the high-carbon steel to identifying obscure metals like Lilandril steel and the so-called ""bog iron"" found in peat deposits, you've got a solid basis of knowledge and skills that allow you to work as a blacksmith for all but the most discerning of clients (and with practice, even those as well!) Any set of plate or any melee weapon crafted from metals of up to Rank Five (ebony, which for some reason is much less impressive in ESO than it is in every other Elder Scrolls setting) is a trivial task for you, provided you have the tools and resources on hand."
2,,100CP,Smith ,Generic Builder,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You have a particular talent for creating anything a blacksmith/armorsmith/weaponsmith might create. Any such crafted object is half again as durable as it would otherwise be. Creation times are halved and your natural talent increases with each purchase of this knack.
* Can be taken indefinitely for creation time modifiers"
3,,200CP,Blacksmithing ,Golden Sun,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You gain understanding of Weyard blacksmithing. While skilled in smithing typical metals, you also learn how to use strange and magical materials to forge powerful enchanted weapons, equipment, and artifacts. Power is decided by your personal skill, the magic of the material involved, and the quality of your forge. Items created with materials from Weyard typically require the user to be an adept to tap into their strength."
4,,200CP,Crafting: Armorsmithing ,Aion SB,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You have begun learning the basics of the crafting techniques of this world. Each purchase of this perk lets you select a category of crafting from the list below; making you proficient in the basics of that craft. You must choose a different category with each purchase. For an included upcharge, your skill in one of your chosen fields is now comparable to those hailed as masters of that profession. This can also be bought multiple times, but each purchase must be used on a different field of crafting."
5,,200CP,Crafting: Weaponsmithing ,Aion SB,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You have begun learning the basics of the crafting techniques of this world. Each purchase of this perk lets you select a category of crafting from the list below; making you proficient in the basics of that craft. You must choose a different category with each purchase. For an included upcharge, your skill in one of your chosen fields is now comparable to those hailed as masters of that profession. This can also be bought multiple times, but each purchase must be used on a different field of crafting."
6,,200CP,Goron Crafting ,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You know the secrets of the Goron Craftsmen. You can create metal armors that can render the wearer immune to heat, powerful hammer-blades that can smash through the toughest rocks, advanced Bomb Arrows that won't explode from ambient heat, and more. Anything built by Gorons, you can recreate, so long as you can gather the right materials."
7,,200CP,Skyforge ,The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"An ancient, mysterious, eagle themed forge added to your warehouse. Any metal items crafted at the forge will be significantly harder and stronger for it. Something about the fires."
8,,200CP,Smithing ,Thundercats 2011,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"The ancient art of working with metal to forge weapons and armor. You know how to make beautiful equipment that can survive countless battles and you could even forge a legendary weapon if you dedicated enough time to it, although it'd probably take at least several years to complete."
9,,200CP,Smithing ,Wakfu,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You know how to make weapons and armor from all sorts of raw materials. From Scarabug wings to Blibli tusk and Gobball hooves, you can turn just about anything you'd find in nature into genuine combat equipment the more powerful the creature it came from, the stronger the equipment will be."
10,,200CP,Zora Crafting ,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You have the skills of a Zora Craftsman. You can create suits of flexible armor that boost the wearer's ability to swim, mighty spears and tridents, powerful Ice Arrows that leave waves of cold in their wake, and more. Any item or structure that a Zora has built, you can recreate, given time and appropriate materials."
11,,300CP,Alloy Smith ,The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Advanced knowledge of chemistry and metallurgy has allowed you to create alloys out of various materials, including metals and chemicals. These new alloys retain all of the properties- including those that are supernatural in nature- of the materials used to make them, allowing you to create truly powerful substances."
12,,300CP,Blacksmith ,Generic Xianxia,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Weapons and armour are not useless in this world. Indeed, one of sufficient talent may create arms and armour that can (and usually do) mean the difference between victory and defeat for those who use them. You are able to make equipment with special traits and great power to aid the one who wields and wears them. What the gear is able to do and how strong it is is dependent on your skill, the processes used, and the reagents that go into their creation - for example, if you wanted to make a flaming sword, you would need a source of magical or conceptual fire to infuse into the blade. With sufficient time and skill the stuff you make can decide the fate of nations, planets, and even entire dimensions. Furthermore the arms and armor you can create are nearly half-again as powerful as they would otherwise be, given similar materials, time, and effort in their creation."
13,,300CP,Blacksmithing: Zen Master ,World of Warcraft,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Smith various melee weapons, mail and plate armor, and other useful trade goods like skeleton keys, shield-spikes and weapon chains to prevent disarming. Blacksmiths can also make various stones to provide temporary physical buffs to weapons.
At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on an even playing field with the top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field."
14,,300CP,Blessed By A God: Blacksmithing ,Everyone Else is a Returnee,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Gain a blessing from one of the recorded gods, gaining a boost in whatever skill or stat they stand for. Additionally, you exemplify that skill or trait, standing heads and shoulders above all others in that field. These gods and goddesses cover just about every domain and aspect there is, from fire to beauty to magic."
15,,300CP,Smith ,Gothic,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You are a professional smith with all the skills to craft any tool, weapon or armor. You even know the rare smelting and forging techniques needed to work with magical ore"
16,,300CP,Munechika’s Legacy to Future Smiths ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"These are the notes of one Munechika Sanjou – one of the blacksmiths who forged the five swords under heaven – blades of renown in this land. Though his notes are rather tattered and sparse, they still possess a wealth of information for any aspiring blacksmith.
Any piece you create is far more likely to become a recognized masterpiece, and should you inscribe a signature onto a piece, you can weave an ability into the weapon to empower them. Any who reads these notes can perform such a task, but the quality of their work will be dependent on their own skill."
17,,300CP,Soul Smith ,Dark Souls,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Well for one, this makes you a pretty good blacksmith with an emphasis on repair, able to repair most normal weapons, armor and trinkets with the right materials and a bit of time. You're also pretty good at forging and upgrading normal weapons and armor. There is more to this craft than you would first think, as Smiths in this world are capable of several unique acts. In this land, smiths can use special stones to imbue weapons with various types of power, such as Fire or Lightning, during the forging process. Given enough time and practice, they can even forge powerful souls into their handiwork to create unique and often times powerful equipment. While this skill doesn't make you the best in the world at this craft, it gives you a solid foundation with room to improve."
18,,300CP,Volcanic Forge ,God of War,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"The Smith God's power is great, but it is not by his will alone that his works are forged. There is also his tools to consider, and with this you have one such tool.
Attached to your Warehouse is a small volcano, a fiery beast that will never fade and never falter. Its power is great, reducing the time you need to break down metals and minerals, reworking them into new forms while increasing their quality and inherent strengths. Should you choose, you may also take a significant hit in forging time to experiment with different metals and minerals, melting and combining them to create a different, newer resource with one quality from the second object in question. Rise, craftsman. Rise and begin your work."
19,,400CP,Superhuman Skill: Blacksmithing Cosmic Level ,Generic Super Academy,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You possess greater than human levels of skill in a single occupation. You could be a superhuman sniper, martial artist, mechanic, chef, or any other area of skill. You may purchase additional occupations for an extra 100CP each. At Street Tier you are slightly above what a normal human could achieve. This level in skill is equivalent to Bullseye's accuracy or Lady Shiva's fighting skill. At National Tier you can achieve feats of skill that would normally only be possible with machine-like perfection. You could literally shoot the wings off a fly at 100 meters, perform delicate brain surgery with a shard of glass in a tenth the normal time, or write a song that inspires a national revolution within days. At Global Tier the laws of physics become flexible when you practice your skills. You can bend bullets Wanted style, balance on a cloud, or swim up a rainstorm. At Cosmic Tier things get a little ridiculous. Your skills acquire conceptual level effects. You could shoot someone by targeting their shadow, dodge bad luck, or repair spatial rifts with duct tape and bailing wire."
20,,400CP,Ambient Magic: Smith ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"A form of Fire Magic, it allows the sensing and manipulation of metals, ores, and other materials used in Smithing (like coal), resistance to fire and burning metal, resistance to smoke damage to lungs, and varying levels of fire manipulation. It is practiced by Daja and Dedicate Frostpine. Not only are Smithmages immune to normal fire and being pierced by nonmagical metal, they can craft supernaturally sharp blades, future scrying mirrors, and any number of charms from engraved metal or twisted wire."
21,,400CP,Blessing of Dundr ,The Banner Saga,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You received the blessing of Dundr as he left the world, and received the boon of the god of smithing and knowledge. You gain godly talent in learning how to smith and can weave stories that capture and entertain people on equal footing of the greatest bards."
22,,400CP,Dwarven Craft ,Lord of the Rings,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You are a master smith, able to single handedly run even a large forge. You can make weapons and armor that stand up to hundreds of years of continuous use, and even know how to mine and forge mystical metals such as Mithril"
23,,400CP,Hammer And Forge ,Legend of Zelda Breath Of The Wild - TG,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"A personal smithy that you can deploy anywhere, the equipment and fires here are in the best possible condition for truly creating great works of blacksmithing art. Any materials needed to be expended in making these weapons and armor will be replenished, unless they're explicitly supernatural. As a bonus, you'll find that as long as you hang up your shingle, it'll be much easier to find warriors who can make the most of the equipment you craft!"
24,,400CP,Incredibly Talented: Blacksmithing ,In Another World With My Smartphone,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"There is one area in which you truly shine. Pick a single skill or talent such as hand to hand, swordsmanship, magical innovation, alchemy, or similar focus. You are now, hands down, one of the best people in the world in that subject.
An alchemist could come up with all sorts of new alchemical concoctions and potions that would astound and amaze your peers, a swordsman could cut down a hundred men on his own nearly effortlessly, a magical innovator could create new spells or rituals or magical items with unsurpassed vision and creativity, and similar such potency applies to any other skill or focus you take with this perk.
Beyond that however you will always be able to refine your focus, allowing you to push yourself to greater and greater heights no matter how skilled you become. You may purchase this perk more than one, but it must apply to a new skill or focus each time it is taken."
25,,400CP,Moonsilver Smith ,World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Not only have you been trained by some of your tribe's best silversmiths you have a talent for crafting silver that goes beyond mere mortal. Not only is it easier to talk a spirit into inhabiting your creations, any silver weapon you create never dulls or breaks in battle. They also deal twice the damage to any creature vulnerable to silver. Outside of this jump, supernatural creatures that take damage from your silver weapons are wounded as if they are vulnerable to silver."
26,,400CP,Swordsmith ,Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"What else shows the spirit of the Japanese but the famed katana blade? Such a central part of their mythos as to have the most famous craftsmen become like heroes themselves. No matter how great, they do not remember the makers of armor or shields like they do artisans of the blade. On the level of legends like Masamune and Muramasa, you are one of these legendary swordsmiths. Even in an ordinary forge with ordinary metals, you can smith katana of a supernatural quality. Edges that split magical steel and blades that don't shatter after a thousand strikes on rock. Often, these even have magical effects if you intend them, such as sharpening as they drink more blood or cutting at a much greater distance than just the physical blade. Should you have access to tools, materials and even magic of a greater level, you will be able to create far greater weapons. Weapons that bring ruin to armies, that cut castles in two with a single slash, fiery tools that send billowing tides of flame to swallow whole forests. When truly inspired, you can even create things on a divine level, the stuff of legends that only a divinity could normally craft. A sword that splits the fabric of reality itself in two, perhaps. With time, your talents may be able to be applied to any form of blade, not just Japanese swords. Should you gain magic of your own, you will see that imbuing those effects into your weapons is effortless, even magnifying the potency of your spells greatly beyond what you would normally be able to cast if you place them into the form of a sword."
27,,400CP,The Earth Forge ,Elder Scrolls Online,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Or rather a replica of it, attached to your warehouse or slotting into the world in the location of your choosing at the start of each jump. The Earth Forge is as much a fortress as it is a workshop, hidden far away prying eyes and located deep underground, its entrance guarded by a small fort carved out in ancient times. The Forge itself is located deep underground, only accessible by following a tunnel that can easily be used as a chokepoint to bottleneck an invading army or fortified into a near- impenetrable hall of traps and sealed dwemer-metal blast doors. It's real value however, is the smithy itself. Using flame salts (which never seem to run low), raw magma (which never seems to burn or cause heatstroke unless you physically leap into it) and a massive blast furnace (which never breaks or needs refueling) in addition to its magical nature and tools surpassing what even the Grand-Masters of Tamriel could hope to lay their hands on, the Earth Forge is quite possibly one of, if not the, greatest smith's workshops on Nirn, equaled perhaps only by the yet-undiscovered Aetherium Forge and the factories of Sotha Sil the Clockwork King. Comes with a small retinue of NPC guards to... well... guard it."
28,,600CP,Flesh and Steel ,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Clothes can make the man, you've learned. It might be possible for someone to perform great feats of stealth in bulky plate, but even someone with that kind of skill would be much better served with the appropriate wear, right? And the tales of those with shining and enchanted armor allowing the hero to survive impossible odds are common - the hammer that could forge such a thing is now in your hands. With this skill, you can create armor and accessories(such as rings, jewelry, and armbands) that directly imbue the wearer with supernatural power, physical boosts, and prowess in certain skills. With this, you could create amber earrings that make one tougher, or a suit of armor that allows you to swim faster! In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil, Gimmick and Trick and Fire and Ice - your weapon crafting skill is among the legendary smiths of old, able to create the kind of weapons only worthy of the 4 Champions of Hyrule itself, matching the mythic weapons of Hyrule such as the sword of Biggoron or the Six Sages!"
29,,600CP,Forge and Ore ,Silmarillion,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,The Dwarves are known for their crafting above all things. To craft the proper equipment takes a fine forge and proper raw materials. You now have your own forge fully equipped for forging any item of metal. Attached to the grand forge is a cave filled with much of the most common ores and even a bit of mithril. In future jumps ores of materials in that setting will begin to appear deeper in the cave. The rarer the metal the less of it there will be. The forge and cave may be attached to your warehouse or another property you own.
30,,600CP,Forgemaster ,Marvel Magic,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"You are skilled in the art of the forge. You craft weapons and shape armor in the way a master artist plies their trade. Perhaps you trained with a god of the forge or studied under the dwarves of Nidavellir or maybe you've simply honed your skills over lifetime's. Whatever the case, your skill with the forge goes beyond what normal mortals would be able to accomplish. You have the skill to work with metals; though perhaps not the natural hardiness required to survive the conditions needed to forge them. And even were you to only have sub-par mundane materials, you could still craft weapons and armor fit for any king who has ever lived. Further, if you know how to utilize the mystic arts, you will find yourself talented at enchanting your creations with your spells and perhaps you will even be able to forge great and powerful artifacts. But the modern world has largely moved beyond the crude weapons of old and if you wish, you may do so as well. With some effort you would be able to transfer your skills to more advanced components, creating powerful firearms or masterful mechanical vehicles."
31,,600CP,The Creator: Blacksmithing ,Everyone Else is a Returnee,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Pick one area of creation. This could be blacksmithing, cooking, enchanting, or more. You now are the undisputed master of that craft. A blacksmith would be able to make unique and legendary class weapons by the dozen while cooks could make the tastiest food in all the realms, using previously thought inedible ingredients, so good that they may even have special effects like recovering stamina or health, or boosting your stats equivalent to ten levels for several minutes at a time. With time and effort you will only increase in ability, your growth uncapped in that area."
32,,800CP,Master Smith | Ahzidal's Apprentice ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Master Smith (400CP) So, how many iron daggers did this take to get? Regardless of the answer to that question the results have surely shown themselves to you and everyone else. You're a master of smithing and the working of metal, forging weapons out of Glass and Ebony is well within your capacity, and even Daedric items may be forged with proper equipment and materials. Your craftsmanship is nothing less than perfection and your opportunity to grow is great as well. Given times you may yet forge tools, weapons and armor that rival even the likes of Daedric artifacts.
Ahzidal's Apprentice (400CP) The art of spellcasting has more to it than just flinging fireballs and screaming about UNLIMITED POWER as one electrocutes their enemies. The arts of Enchantment and Alteration stand as testaments to this fact, enchantment in particular stands as a powerful, yet indirect system of magic and when it comes to this branch and the operation of it only the Dragon Priest Ahzidal is your equal. Like him you've collected vast knowledge pertaining to the various magical bases of the Mer, whether it be the ancient runes of the Ayleids or the process of harmonizing the seven natures of metal. This craft extends far and wide and with it even a mere band of 500 warriors could be given equipment powerful enough to fell a powerful race of spellcasters like the Falmer, or in other, more simple words your enchantments are legendary. You could perhaps go even further, runes are simply another language, and if understanding them allows you to use them, then perhaps even others like that of the Dovah might be as well.
This is lore based Daedric artifacts which includes shit like instant kill weapons or key that can conceptually unlock anything. Or a sword that stole power from a daedra and flew a floating city of soul warriors into mundus. Pretty much all major Daedric artifacts are conceptual even if they are nerfed for the game."
33,,1000CP,Divine-Smith/S Rank | Falna ,Danmachi,Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy,"Divine-Smith/S Rank (1000CP) Unlike the original Blacksmith this version grants you the ability to add multiple magical abilities and powers that you have access to in your creations along with infinite usage of this magical abilities and powers. At max rank it would allow you to create a divine item and add a maximum of twelve magical abilities and powers that has greater power, utility and effectiveness compared to the magic swords of this world.
Falna (0CP) The blessings of a god or goddess are given to you. Your abilities, as well as any skills you develop, are portrayed upon your back and your God/Goddess can update them for you. Each level up potentially allows you to gain a developmental ability and gain skills every time you gain a new greater goal, realization, enlightenment or conviction allowing you to potentially gain new skills based on those. For 300cp would upgrade the Falna that you received that guarantees that you would gain a developmental ability and skill every time you level up and after this jump the perks, abilities and skills that you gained from the past to the future would be translated and displayed into a skill, magic and developmental ability that you can improve along with the Falna automatically updates periodically. You can also view your Falna in your mind or let others see your back to view your status along with it automatically integrating any existing System that you have access gained all of the advantages and discarding as much weakness and drawbacks as possible. The one that would give you the Falna is the God/Goddess of the Familia that you choose in the Familia Section and if you are a God/Goddess you can give yourself a Falna even if it's not possible in cannon or the companion that took the God/Goddess Origin. After this jump you are given an option on either retaining this System or not and if you choose to abandon this System all the developmental ability, magic and skills that you have would become a perk allowing you to use them without the assistance of the Falna."
