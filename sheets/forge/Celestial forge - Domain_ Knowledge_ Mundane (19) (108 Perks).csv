0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,50CP,Satisfactorio Crafting,Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You can make automated equipment for extraction and processing of raw resources. You can make
automated industrial equipment out of simple items, similar to the items in the games."
2,,50CP,Hell Medicine,Taimanin,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You possess the knowledge and skills of an expert in Hellish Medicine. Reattaching or regenerating limbs
is something you could easily do with the proper tools, While fashioning new and better aphrodisiacs for
the use of turning women into slaves is practically routine."
3,,100CP,Basic Robotics,Mega Man Classic,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"With your understanding of robotics, you can easily produce minor worker robots. You could produce
Metools, Joes, and the like in a cave with a box of scraps. These do not yet have sapience, but who
knows what might happen with time. And besides, they don't need sapience to have combat
applications. After all, you don't need to be aware of your own existence to shoot someone."
4,,100CP,Body Transfer,Empire From the Ashes,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The art and science of transferring a consciousness from body to body is a gory, ugly one. And it's one
you know now. The how of moving brains from body to body, making sure no loss in memory or sanity
occurs is within your grasp. And you can do it even with technology no more advanced than the 21st
century. Of the world you started jumping from, smartass."
5,,100CP,Beat Stick,Monster Hunter XXX,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Ah, your trusty hammer. Your best friend in the workshop, and for bopping a Monster on the head in a
pinch. With this Perk you are guaranteed ‘competence’ for any feasible application of a hammer. In
addition, anything you happen to make using said hammer is at least twenty percent better than it
otherwise would be."
6,,100CP,Chemist,Fallout 4,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Groovy! Knowledge of chemistry has given you the ability to recite the entire periodic table, as well as
knowledge of many exciting compounds such as dipotassium phosphate! Oh, and you can also make less
exciting things like Stimpacks and Psycho, but why would you do that?"
7,,100CP,Bio Augmentation,Taimanin,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"It’s not enough to use hell technology and medicine to simply heal people when you can do so much
more. You’ve learned how to use hell technology and medical techniques to change and augment a
person. Whether it’s turning them into better fighters by making them stronger and tougher, or by
turning them into better prostitutes by increasing their sensitivity and their orifice capacity and
toughness. With time and experience you’ll be able to create whole new organisms to fit your needs."
8,,100CP,Engineering,Teen Titans,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You're a master mechanic and an expert at building robots and other technological devices. You also
have a fair bit of knowledge about hacking into computers."
9,,100CP,Etoria Disciple,Final Fantasy XII,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The art of Etoria, the technology which allowed for the creation of things like airships, has always
fascinated you. You've noticed patterns in technology, and armed with that knowledge you adapt to new
technology quickly. Your teacher has given you a skystone the key to building your own airship in time,
and you'll have no lack of resources."
10,,100CP,Bound and Gagged,Earth Defense Team Star Guardians,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Every Dystopian soldier from the cadets to the Admirals knows how to capture and secure their
prisoners, and most have personal experience in doing so. But you stand out from your fellow soldiers as
a particularly experienced master or mistress, and can skillfully restrain defeated foes with minimal effort
as long as you have anything that could be used as restraints on hand, even the shreds of a prisoner’s
own clothing. While your bondage isn’t inescapable or super- strong with this perk alone, you have an
accurate sense of how securely your prisoners are contained and can engineer more elaborate restraints
to secure prisoners with exotic abilities."
11,,100CP,Hoarder’s Eyes,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You know the name and function of any object just by looking at it. Only that however, and the function
is rather abridged, giving you a fairly brief overview of exactly what it does and nothing beyond that. You
should probably try not to make any more assumptions beyond that."
12,,100CP,SCIENCE!,Megamind,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You can do science! Mad science is your bread and butter, but that sort of thing can't be done if you
don't have the basics first. This perk provides you an extensive, vast knowledge in every branch of
science that exists in the world, from maths to biology to astrophysics to everything in between!
No matter what it may be, if it can be called a science, you have skills and knowledge equivalent to a
lifetime's worth of study and research in it. This carries over to future worlds, but the extent of your
knowledge and skills reduces the more complicated and esoteric the science in question gets. You'll
always have a novice's level of skill, anyway."
13,,100CP,But It Can Be Better!,Generic Hentai Superheroes,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You’ve taken a look at the common everyday items, and you’re shocked by how crude its design is. Why,
with just a tweak here and there, it could be so much better! Why, just look what you did to that
vibrator! It now brings its user to a screaming orgasm in .5 seconds.
a. Basic: You are now an Nth level genius. Given time, you can reverse engineer any piece of technology
you get your hands on and rebuild it. You can work with anything, anywhere. Even if that’s just a box of
scrap parts in a cave in the middle of the desert."
14,,100CP,Scientist Supreme,The Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You're smarter than most; your knowledge covers nearly every scientific field, and while you're not
knowledgeable to the point where you'll be making major breakthroughs- you don't know anything that
you couldn't learn already- you're more than capable of understanding those who do."
15,,100CP,Cyberneticist,Taimanin,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Bioaugmentation isn’t the only way to improve someone. Cybernetics is a potent method for
augmenting someone as well. You’re an expert when it comes to making cybernetics that combine both
human and demon technology. Asuka’s experimental combat limbs were powerful enough that Edwin
Black had to take her seriously which showcased just what the power of technology can do in this world."
16,,100CP,Smith of the Order,Van Helsing,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Let the people like Friar Carl deal with the technical things, like an automatic crossbow. You are the one
who makes, salvages, and creates the primary weapon of the Knights of Holy Order: Firearms. You are a
gunsmith and knowledgeable in the ways of blackpowder and flintlock weapons, and can expand this
knowledge to other weaponry."
17,,100CP,Trap Layer,Bloons,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You can not only build a wide variety of traps, and trapping supplies, but you also have an excellent mind
for putting them in play. You can identify potential choke points or ambush areas, and set them up
accordingly. Glue, Nets, Pits, Spikes, and more are all among the types of traps that you can build."
18,,100CP,Scientific Specialization | True Hero Potential,Monster Girl Quest,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Scientific Specialization (100CP) 
There is one type of field in which you excel. Pick a focus, it can be necromancy, engineering, or even a focus on a certain type of monster species. Within that field you get a fairly large boost to your research. Those who specialize in necromancy will have a talent similar to that of the Croix family, whereas someone specialized in alraune could become much better at developing plants. Make your name in scientific arts.
True Hero Potential (Free)
You sure are gifted aren’t you? You now have the potential that Luka and Heinrich possessed in their
prime. With training and combat experience; your strength, speed, stamina, durability, magical power,
and skill in one weapon of your choice will increase, culminating in their level of power. If you are a
Mamano you can inflict Critical Ecstasy during your time here but only in this world. Both Mamano and
Humans start off about as strong as a level 1 before perks or previous jumps are factored in."
19,,100CP,Uncommon Taste,Elder Scrolls Online,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"One of the most critical elements to a successful battle, yet one so easily ignored, is nutrition. Many an
army has been squelched simply through malnutrition, or worse, starvation. Fortunately, that's a
problem you can easily rectify, and best of all, you can even make it a decent meal rather than the
hardtack and watered down mazte soldiers are usually subjected to! Your skills let you make recipes up
to Rank 3 (Level 49) and Difficult (Blue) complexity. Not just foods, your drinks, especially the alcoholic
ones, are excellent. Of course you could easily just open a restaurant or an inn somewhere, but the
health, stamina, and/or magicka revitalizing and fortifying properties of your meals would be wasted on
pedestrian pursuits."
20,,100CP,When All You Have is a Hammer...,Niplheim's Hunter,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Well hopefully you at least have the forge too, right? You have the stamina and sexual skill to drive your
partners absolutely wild in bed, regardless of whether you’re the one doing the hammering or the one
getting hammered. We’re talking easy multiple orgasms and silly-looking ahegao faces if you fully apply
yourself, though you needn’t worry about breaking your partner’s mind or other parts for real regardless
of what their pillow talk sounds like. Oh, and you’re a pretty dab hand with blacksmithing tools too, I
guess."
21,,200CP,Augmentation R&D,Deus Ex Human Revolution,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You have an extensive understanding of the underlying mechanics of DE:HR's cybernetic augmentation
architecture; How it works, how it could work, and what avenues to analyse to see if it can be improved -
and with time, brand new augmentations. In addition to this, your intelligence is increased to handle
such a workload, alongside all the attendant knowledge necessary to mess with the human body -
trauma surgery and fixing up broken individuals is an old hat to you, now."
22,,200CP,Broadcast Booster,The Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You've discovered a way to make your signals much more effective and efficient, letting you transmit or
receive signals and other methods of transmission, such as radio waves, on a global scale. Call your
power armor to your exact location, get five bars wherever you go, or make the ultimate remote control."
23,,200CP,Chemist,Batman Beyond,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You've learned how to create drugs, steroids, medicines, and even deadly toxins like nerve gas.
Additionally any chemical compounds you personally create can no longer kill you, however they can still
cause unwanted side effects."
24,,200CP,Mastercrafter,Niplheim's Hunter,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Speaking of blacksmithing, that’s not the only thing you can do, not by a long shot. Your crafting
expertise covers a wide range of fields, from woodworking to sewing and leatherworking to sculpting
and even a bit of architecture, all the better for making all those suits of armor out of things other than
metal. You can also figure out how to work even the most exotic materials like meteoric iron and dragon
scales, wasting none of your precious resources and even having some left over to use for fun after
important projects. Maybe make some exotic sex toys?"
25,,200CP,Hellish Advancement,DOOM 3,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The teleportation research in the Delta Labs is arguably the most advanced field of science known to
mankind today. With potential applications in everything from aeronautics to personal transportation,
both short-range and long-range teleporters represent one of the greatest advances in recent decades
and the fact that they operate by tunneling through literal hell is hardly a detriment, is it? You are a
master of using dimensional technologies, especially those relying on less than pleasant realms for their
function. From dedicated safety systems to mapping the hellish wastelands of the damned 'by remote' to
find the most efficient paths, if it involves alternate realities or physical embodiments of evil you've
probably got some ideas on how to make use of your findings. Even better if it involves both."
26,,200CP,Holy Forge,Hellgate London,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You know how to craft the Holy Power Armor of the Templars, Each suit of armor is customized for the
user. All suits increase strength and speed, however Common personal suit augmentations include
Anchor spikes (that form from hands or feet), Hammer Fist (lock your gauntlets into a hammer),
camouflage screening, and 360 HUD in the helmet."
27,,200CP,It Floats,Dragon Ball,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"It's not rocket science! Except it totally is. You now know how to construct the common 'rocket cars' of
Capsule Corporation, as well as being able to construct human-sized jetpacks that are safe for
commercial use. You don't learn much about space travel, but you'll find it easier to grasp should you
start learning."
28,,200CP,Toymaster,Generic BDSM,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"BDSM goes hand-in-hand with sex toys and other props, ranging from soft hemp ropes and sexy leather
outfits to exotic furniture with built-in restraints to the most advanced mechanical and magical restraints
you could ask for. You can design and build your own sex toys using whatever materials you have on
hand, ranging from carving and polishing a hunk of wood into a dildo all the way up to making full-on
robotic bondage machines. These machines always work flawlessly for their intended purpose: the
wooden dildo will never give you splinters and machines will never malfunction or stop working in the
middle of a session. Moreover, you have perfect mastery over any sex toy you’ve made, whether you’re
getting just the right angle to hit a g-spot with a vibrator or swinging a bullwhip around in a street fight."
29,,200CP,Peak ADVENT Technology,XCOM 2,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Before you defected you were working in some of the most top secret black projects any human had
access to. You have an encyclopaedic knowledge of all ADVENT technology, minus some of the genetic
manipulation techniques and basically anything that would give away ADVENTs dark secrets."
30,,200CP,Sentry Builder,Bloons,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You can build robotic sentry towers, which are capable of identifying targets and firing on their own,
though they aren't that bright. Can select between Tacks, Blades, Flamethrowers, Glue, and other
ammunition, and may even equip specific weapons onto the tower. Can select firing rates of single
direction or omni-directional."
31,,250CP,Craftsman,Starbound,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Building things is a major part of the Starbound experience, and with this perk, you gain a leg-up on
crafting and building. You now have a basic knowledge of how to craft things, to the point where you can
take a mental concept for some simple item or piece of furniture and flesh it out into a full crafting
blueprints given a few hours to sit and think about it.
Anvil Specialty You know how to shape metal, extracting it from ores and turning it into items, mostly
melee weapons of various sorts. You have an instinctive understanding of how to make different alloys,
and you can even break down existing metals and reshape them, without the metals weakening.
Farming Specialty You have an instinctive knowledge of how to make plants grow, even those with more
exotic requirements. Plants under your care will flourish, even those that might normally require
extremely delicate care, and best of all, the growth of any plants in your care is extremely accelerated.
Plants that might take months to produce a harvest will grow to fruition in mere weeks, or possibly even
days.
Kitchen Specialty You are a whiz in the kitchen, capable of making dishes with a variety of health
benefits, that also happen to be both filling and delicious. The foods that you make will actually produce
tangible bonuses in those that eat them, starting with enhanced healing, and branching out into
increased strength, agility, energy, resistance to heat or flame, to such exotic effects as glowing in the
dark or damaging those that touch you.
Medicine Specialty You can make a variety of medical treatments, suitable for handling a wide range of
bumps, bruises, burns, and more. Your treatments will have boosted effectiveness, with everything from
your bandages on up promoting healing beyond the norm. You also know how to make certain chemical
stimulants, which can safely (and non-addictively) provide a boost to those who use them.
Tech Specialty Beyond the twelve basic Techs, there are many more possibilities for implanted techbased
abilities. With this perk, you gain the ability to craft techs for yourself, which could perform
functions such as creating a temporary sphere of null gravity around you, giving you a short ranged burst
of super-speed, allowing you to shoot energy from the soles of your feet to fly, or even giving you a
short-range, line-of-sight teleport. You will have to work out how to craft these abilities for implanting,
and you'll have greater success with designing tech-based versions of movement abilities that you
already possess. However, the more powerful the ability, the more energy it will take as a Tech. Only
three Techs can be implanted in any one person at a given time."
32,,300CP,Aqua Seismology Society,ARIA,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The Gnomes follow the tradition of handing down knowledge from old to young as well, and like the
Salamanders they are very well aware of how crucial their task is in maintaining the workings of Aqua.
The importance of maintaining gravity as well as ensuring that the tidal movements occur regularly is not
lost on them, and for most apprentice Gnomes the importance of this is etched into their teachings from
a young age. As part of the society, you'll be brought to understand the inner workings of a planet such
as Mars, including what was necessary as part of the terraforming process. The knowledge you'll gain
here might help you bring life to new planets if you can grasp the concepts to apply them to other
circumstances. Knowing astrophysics might help you with studying a planet at its exterior, but the
Society is most involved when the planet itself is alive and moving."
33,,300CP,Climate Control Society,ARIA,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"A group of experienced Salamanders who, sticking to Aqua tradition, have maintained a large repository
of knowledge for up and coming Salamanders to learn from the Climate Control Society cultivates new
talent and expertise as they continue to perfect the art of weather manipulation vital to Aqua's
sustenance. No one knows better just how important it is to continuing making progress on the science
of climate control. Should the Salamanders ever become too lax, all the efforts of their ancestors may
well go to waste. As a member of the society, your skills in developing new weather control techniques
down to the fine details of precipitation control and enhancement. Naturally, being a scientifically
focused field as it is, the society has a wealth of information on anything climate related, and not strictly
information from Aqua either."
34,,300CP,Gadgeteering,Blazblue,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Ars Magus aren't the solution to every problem, and more often than not end up causing more than they
solve. You have training in ""Traditional"" science, and can create purely mechanical devices and weapons,
such as magnetism-powered gauntlets."
35,,300CP,Grease Monkey,Bubblegum Crisis,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"What can you fix or build? What CAN'T you fix or build? Nothing, that's what. From hyper-cars to Buma,
computers to Hardsuits, with the right tools and enough time and experiments, you can build it all,
weaponry included."
36,,300CP,Lore of the Lost Homeland,Lord of the Rings Twilight of the North,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Though in these days much has been lost of the lore of Nmenor, even from the days of Elendil, you now
possess such knowledge as was available during the days of the ending of the Second Age and as such
can be considered one of the most learned in those subjects of any living Man.
Indeed, such lore as the waybread and drinks used on the march and held in need-wallets that are like to
the elven lembas and miruvor but less potent.
The knowledge used in the making of the Othram, the great outer wall of Minas Anor, its outward face
hard and dark and smooth, wrought of the same black stone used to construct the tower of Orthanc.
Unbreakable by any means available to Men. The lore used in the making of such weapons as the barrow
blades, or the fine armor of the Nmenorean lords. Even the knowledge of ship-lore and building. The
various architectural and engineering wonders of the early years of Arnor and Gondor are yours to know."
37,,300CP,Superior Science,Marvel Magic,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Magic is undeniably useful and powerful but people have made great strides without relying on it as
well. Humanity has used technology to conquer the earth while other races have forged great, universespanning
empires without ever relying upon the mystic arts. You now gain a talent with the science of
this world. Far from the smartest person on the planet, you are still capable of creating technological
wonders far in advance of what your old world was capable of. From laser guns to armies of robots, if
you have the materials then you can create technology that can stand up to mysticism."
38,,300CP,Tower Maker,Bloons,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You can make Towers! Structures designed around amplifying the abilities of those standing on top of
them, allowing them to project force across a wide-area. Someone in one of your towers will find their
range of attack increased slightly, and one purpose-built for them will increase it even more, in addition
to specific boosts related to their abilities."
39,,300CP,Valkyrian Science,Valkyria Chronicles,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Somehow, you've gained some of the knowledge that the Valkyrur used to possess, giving you the skill
and ability to graft Ragnite machinery on a level far above any modern human. At first, you'd only be
able to create replica's of the Valkyrian weapons, but with many years of study it might be possible to
recreate the Valkyrur themselves."
40,,400CP,Drug Manufacturer,Kamikaze Kommittee Ouka,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The ability to design and manufacture drugs is now yours. With knowledge on a wide array of natural,
synthetic, and exotic ingredients and their reactions to each other, you are able to conjure up narcotics
and medicines alike for any purpose. You can also modify and improve existing drugs with special status
effects or just to increase their potency. As long as you have the tools and materials, you are able to do
anything with drugs. Even better is the ability to find these materials and tools with ease, if you don’t
happen to have any around. And if you can’t find them, you can safely improvise with what’s lying
around."
41,,400CP,Ancient Knowledge,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You have been gifted with the secrets of Ancient Sheikah technology, and you know how to build not
only weapons and armor using this technology, but in time, you might even be able to recreate
Guardians and other wonders."
42,,400CP,Brilliant Engineer,Batman the Animated Series,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Theories are one thing, but actually applying your knowledge is another; luckily, you can be good at
both. You're a very good engineer, and with enough time and resources you are capable of creating
battle suits that greatly enhance the strength of the wearer, invisibility suits (driving the wearer crazy is
optional), vehicles on par with the Batmobile and even life like automatons. Your creations could be a
powerful tool for both good and evil."
43,,400CP,Chemist,Inception,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Oh, calling them 'drugs' or 'narcotics' is so... unflattering. You simply provide what the people want.
You're really good at developing psychoactive chemicals, especially the various dream-related
compounds. With a little effort, you could do anything from guaranteeing someone gets a pleasant night
to allowing your clients to go deeper into the dreams than anyone before."
44,,400CP,Orgasmic Extraction,World of Tentacles,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You have mastered using elaborate setups to extract 'orgasmic energy' from one or more donors, which
can then be substituted (in sufficient quantities) for other types of energy, be it mana, 'life energy’ or
simply massive amounts of electric power. The
precise setup, from ritual circles calling tentacles through portals to mechanical rape machines, must be
tailored to the specific application it is fueling. It may take hours to complete as it weakens the donor’s
ability to resist further climaxes, but only does so when the last of the donors involved is overcome. The
rarer, or larger, the amount of energy you require the more that will need to be taken from the donors,
and there is a chance that there may not be enough for the intended purpose. However, more attractive
donors and more 'intense' setups provide more energy and any reserves of the desired energy that the
donors possess can be tapped through the setup.
* Note: This gives access only to mechanical versions of this setup."
45,,400CP,Clocks with Buttons and Lasers,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Interesting. Did you mingle with the Chronosapiens at some point? Well, you might not necessarily be a
catch-all scientist like a Genius but one thing you definitely understand is the technology behind time
travel. Things like holograms that let you view the immediate past, time machines that let you move
forward and back in time, or beams of light that age things into dust within seconds...you're able to
construct devices that play with the flow of time like a toy."
46,,400CP,Crazed Chemistry,Batman the Animated Series,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You've learned how to make some of the chemicals used by the villains of Gotham; namely Venom, the
super-steroid used by Bane, the fear toxin used by Scarecrow, the Joker's laughing gas, and Poison Ivy's
various toxins. In addition, your mastery of chemistry allows you to create chemicals and formulas with
similar effects."
47,,400CP,Ties that Bind,Generic BDSM,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"It would be pretty embarrassing if you got your sub all dolled up and ready to go and then a rope
snapped or a cuff came loose in the middle of a session, wouldn’t it? But you’re an expert judge of what
is required to render a person totally helpless and can do so effortlessly as long as you’ve got the right
restraints on hand. For a normal person that might be just a bit of hemp rope, but for someone with
superpowers you might need some anti-magic wards or purple kryptonite or whatever. Regardless, as
long as you know what you’re dealing with, once they’re all tied up they’re not getting away without
outside help no matter what."
48,,400CP,Engineer,Batman Beyond,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You possess the knowledge and skill to build power armor, flying cars, complex weaponry, robotic
drones, and other devices. Additionally anything you make is now slightly safer to use than the average
consumer product and none of your inventions can cause fatal injuries through sabotage. Currently your
technical skills are on par with Bruce Wayne but you can learn how to improve your talents by studying."
49,,400CP,Evolutionary Incentive,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"If you have been paying even the slightest bit of attention, you will notice a lot of powers in this
multiverse come from the unique biology of different alien species. So naturally, it makes perfect sense
to want to harness it and perhaps play with the mechanics a little bit. You are a master of capturing and
manipulating DNA using technology, able to mutate creatures into something new by playing with their
genetics like play-doh, giving them new powers or even ironing out things like genetic illnesses or
defects. You're better at mixing and matching than making anything from scratch, but eventually you can
learn how to recreate certain superpowered genetics from one alien species in another using surgery or
even small technological devices. You're not quite making the next Omnitrix with this alone, but this
definitely sets the foundation for it."
50,,400CP,Quantum Warping,Generic Hentai Superheroes,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Your inventions no longer obey the laws of reality and physics. You can now create devices that warp
reality around a single person. Bind them in a bubble of paused time, Make what they're wearing
transparent. Or create a portal near them from which rapacious tentacles emerge. Sadly, the devices are
one-shots, and require a week to rebuild/repair."
51,,400CP,"Field of Research: Clockwork, Aircrafts, Guns",Dota 2,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"To call technology a tree, which one arbitrarily climbs upwards through non-descript Science! is simply
insulting. Science is discovery through rationality, technology the rewards of our efforts to better
understand the world. Or something similarly fruity, as the humans so often enjoy defining things in
needlessly overcomplicated and faux- poetic ways. There are (3) particular fields you've studied, and
have a great deal of theoretical and practical knowledge of, for both general tool development and
combat duty. Choose from the following.
Clockwork: Rather unorthodox, you have extensive knowledge of clockmaking and how to turn it for
combat. A particularly despised design (mostly by enemies, sometimes by allies) are electrified cogs
designed to drain mana and harm any enemies who draw near. Also includes the groundwork for a suit
of armor able to stand up against mythic beasts and sorcery alike, giving you the strength of an army and
protection stronger than most bunkers. While some would overlook it, grappling hooks can be projected
enormously well with some of these mechanisms, allowing you to fly across battlefields.
Aircrafts: While most have long since accepted the idea of mechanical flight to be impossible, some Keen
have held on to the dream, you included. At last, it has paid off. You've gotten a basic design for a fully
functioning flying machine, able to mount weapons and withstand some amount of stress. Expanding
that into something good for transport (the initial design might hold up to two people, if you give up
fighting) is your prerogative, but really? YOU'VE DEVELOPED FLIGHT! TAKE THAT, STUPID WIZARDS!
Guns: Exactly what it sounds like. Tubular devices which discharge projectiles at high speeds, there's no
muss or fuss about what it does, even if making a good design might be fiddly. Includes good prototypes
for personal firearms such as rifles and light artillery such as cannons. Groundwork to scale upwards for
versions mounted on ships, castles, or flying devices is included, but finalization is your job."
52,,400CP,"Field of Research: Lasers, Rocketry, Robotics",Dota 2,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"To call technology a tree, which one arbitrarily climbs upwards through non-descript Science! is simply
insulting. Science is discovery through rationality, technology the rewards of our efforts to better

have a great deal of theoretical and practical knowledge of, for both general tool development and
combat duty. Choose from the following.
Lasers: While the potential for these is incredible, your previous workplace's necessities required that
you focus on the development of high-grade cutters in order to aid in more important research. Any
combat utility is purely incidental... but certainly welcomed.
Rocketry: Projectiles propelled by internal combustion. It's simple, some would call it crude, but it works.
Includes the underlying theory behind heat-seekers, intercontinental systems, homing technology, and of
course, explosives. Although, everything other than that last one will likely require some personal
touches to maximize combat ability.
Robotics: Simple and clean, it is the construction of independently moving machinery, otherwise known
as robots. Does not include much in the way of AI. Basic designs are better than any knight, but numbers
are the best bet against most enemies to be found here unless you devote significant time towards the
construction of any given craft. Includes knowledge of personal-scale tools such as manipulators."
53,,400CP,"Field of Research: Transdimensional Theory, Chainsaws, Chains, Saws and General Anti-Flora
Equipment",Dota 2,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"To call technology a tree, which one arbitrarily climbs upwards through non-descript Science! is simply

combat duty. Choose from the following.
Transdimensional Theory: Particularly exotic and full of potential, the field of transdimensional studies is
rather young and as much as it has allowed incredible advances it also has brought forth great
calamities. Never forget the Violet Plateau Incident. Either way, while you are only able to study
dimensional and spatial anomalies caused by other sources for now, the idea of crossing continents with
the press of a button, calling resources and tools from faraway bases and workshops then sending them
back home once you're done, and exploring new universes entirely remains a very realistic goal. Just,
keep in mind that there's plenty of nightmarish monstrosities sitting around our reality which would just
love it if some schmuck opened the door for them. I reckon that'll probably stop being a problem for you
in a decade's time, but still.
Chainsaws, Chains, Saws, and General Anti-Flora Equipment: Besides the utility for wood harvesting
purposes, you also have great knowledge of what to do with wood itself, being able to engineer around
wood's strong and weak points in order to replace metal during the construction of things such as armor
or general machinery. Why, you could even create a suit of armor able to cut down forests in record time
while defending from any attacking trees, saw whirling around you as an active defense, chains pulling
you along while tearing leafage from its foundation, and your main blade spinning around the battlefield
to cut down any straggling trees. Does not come with traumatic memories of plant-based murder or
rampant paranoia."
54,,400CP,Fitting into a Mould: Scientist,Gravity Rush,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"In a world where magic is essentially limited to a few, science is the only tool that can be used as an
equalizer. So your job here in researching and developing new technology may be essentially what's
needed in order to keep humanity going. Well, that's the motivation that sounds noble anyways. In
practice, much of what you're going to do here might be of more use to you than the common folk in
Hekseville. For one thing you'll be very well versed in Nevi adaptation technology by the end of your time
here, as well as constructing technology necessary for the control and manipulation of gravity. Can't say
that won't come in handy...considering both the Nevi and the Shifters are quite possibly the biggest
threats to the city in the eyes of some."
55,,400CP,Toymaker,Monster Hunter XXX,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Now sure, you could be ‘Mister Wholesome’ and just make a menagerie of toys for children, but that
would be a waste of your potential. You design the toys of adults. The Dragonator? Fun piece, could do
with a lot less “impale” and a lot more “vibrate.” Or you can design and build a BDSM harness fit to make
a Fatalis squeal in ecstasy... You’re going to need a lot of rope. And all of those Monster materials sing in
your hands, like using Qurupeco parts to make a Hunting Horn that really sets the mood. Or Malfestio
parts to make weapons that hypnotize as you hit someone with it."
56,,400CP,Gadgeteer | Engineer,Generic City of Adventure,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Gadgeteer (100CP) You can easily create and perform maintenance on small gadgets and common
electronics. Smoke bombs, trick arrows, the contents of the average utility belt...if it's simple and
handheld, you can probably make it. If it's commercially available, you could easily repair, bypass, or
hotwire it.
Engineer (300CP) You have mastered one technical specialty. Lasers, sound, rockets,
computers...whatever it is, you can create devices incorporating this concept that are advanced enough
that you could build your heroic career on these inventions. You could get away with sticking '-master' or
somesuch to the name of your field of study for a super-name and people will take you absolutely
seriously."
57,,400CP,Higgs Knowledge,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Higgs particles allow humanity to help build the wonders of the modern age, such as modern
archaeologies, thanks to their ability to produce free energy. With this perk gain an understanding of
Higgs particles and their potential uses and in no time, you'll be able to build Higgs engines just as good
if not better than the ones used by Antagonists. With time and effort you will even discover new uses for
Higgs particles."
58,,400CP,Mecha Fetishist,Arpeggio of Blue Steel,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"So what if you prefer the company of a sleek steel hull over another person? You have an encyclopaedic
knowledge of both WWII and modern battleships, and can repair and build nearly every advanced
system that humanity uses in this time period, such as android robots (for some reason maid models are
popular), cybernetics, supercavitation drives for ships, submarines and torpedoes, life support
machinery, powered armor suits for elite soldiers and multiplied drone tanks. This technology is still a
few notches below what the Fog can bring to bear, but it's better than nothing."
59,,400CP,New Age,X-Men Evolution,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"There's autonomous fighting robots, energy weapons, and gene enhancement in this world with only a
few of the brightest minds capable of creating such tech. All this and more are now at your grasp as you
can not only build these technological marvels but can vastly improve upon them and others at your
leisure. You can create any piece of tech from this world from everything mentioned above and so much
more. Creating hydra clones that are completely loyal to you, manipulating the x-gene to create mutants
and form your own brotherhood, and much more are the tip of the iceberg for you. You are a fountain of
ever growing knowledge in all technological fields areas and have the skills to usher in a revolution."
60,,400CP,Post-Modern Frankenstein,Blade Runner 2049,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Men like you come once every generation at most, so it must be a miracle that two of you are in the
world at the same time. You were already a scientific genius but now you've become a creator who could
equal Wallace himself in the arts of the body and Stelline in the arts of the mind. You could quite easily
create Replicants at the current level of advancement from the ground up and fill their minds with
memories near impossible to tell apart from reality, so long as you had the proper equipment. Unlike
those two brilliant minds, you'll find yourself always able to improve your knowledge of the body and
mind. As long as you put in the time, you'll continue to make advancements no matter the roadblocks of
progress you encounter."
61,,400CP,Programming and Computer Science,Worm,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Supercomputers are your bread and butter, and Artificial Intelligence is your idea of a PDA. Data,
programs, and digital devices are your playthings, not to mention that your understanding of such
systems mean you can hack anything that could possibly be hacked. There isn't really any limit on the
extent you could push computing hardware, and any kind of software you can imagine is within your
grasp. Please do note that flaunting this is likely to attract some attention from a few major players in
particular. Then again that might not be a bad thing depending on your disposition and plans."
62,,400CP,Redstone Certification,Unmodded Minecraft,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You fully understand the ins and outs of Redstone and how it can be used to power and control the
machinery of this world. You're also an architect and engineer that's very good at making complex
devices out of simple materials. You could probably control a small town from a single room with enough
levers, or make a working calculator with only water, floodgates, and pressure plates."
63,,400CP,Schizo Genius,Draka Series,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You are now one of the most brilliant scientists and engineers around, capable of inventing and building
things such as nanotechnology, reactionless drives, or quantum parallel-world portals with enough work.
You might not be able to do so instantly, at least not with this perk alone, but with sufficient time and
resources even the most outrageous examples of technology from this setting can be reproduced, or at
least close equivalents. What's more, you're no longer bound by standard 'tech trees' of development;
you can find work arounds that let you do things like build warp-drive ships without needing to have
microcircuit technology for the control systems, or high-performance aircraft without modern materials
for the airframe. 'Schizo tech' like this might be a bit kludgey or idiosyncratic in some respects, and might
not have all the bells and whistles, but it will still work."
64,,400CP,Solar Harnessing,Mysterious City of Gold,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You can construct articles of technology that harness the power of the sun for their functions, or
upgrade existing devices to do so. Man-portable weapons should be a breeze, but larger constructions
will take more time and effort."
65,,400CP,Super Science,Justice League Unlimited,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Technology is something a lot of people take for granted, unlike you hardly anyone ever stops to think
exactly how a pyrokinetic super villain might be safely contained, or what you could use to reverse the
mutation that transformed someone into a giant slime monster, or even what type of defenses a group
of superheroes would need to protect their headquarters from killer alien robots. Fortunately your
wealth of knowledge on both emerging and modern day technology is such that you can easily come up
with scientific solutions to deal with supernatural dangers, such as building power suppressing super
prisons, creating chemical concoctions that can rewrite DNA, and constructing powerful energy weapons
that can blast alien threats into dust. Your genius mind will also allow you to build weapons, equipment,
and biological compounds for yourself in case you decide you want to become a hero or villain. Right
now you're basically as intelligent and ingenuous as Lex Luthor or Gorilla Grodd but there's nothing
stopping you from learning more or increasing your intelligence using technology or genetic engineering.
Keep in mind however that while you may be able to upgrade yourself or others using science, there's
nothing preventing your augmentations from failing or causing more harm than good."
66,,400CP,Techie,Batman Arkham Asylum,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"What sorta school did you go to?! Must have been Harvard or something, because you know how to
make really advanced technology. You can make anything from security gates that fry anyone who gets
too close to code-breaking machines that can hack almost anything."
67,,400CP,THINGS MAN WAS NOT MEANT TO KNOW,CthulhuTech,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You have a few advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics areas. You can
engineer any technological (but not technomagical) wonder that exists in this jump. In future jumps you
will be able to engineer any standard technologies of the setting."
68,,400CP,Tim Taylor Technology,Subnautica,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Power systems like nuclear reactors and solar plants produce double their normal output without
straining the circuitry. Tools and habitat fixtures may be put into overdrive, increasing effect at the
expense of efficiency. While in a vehicle, you may redline the engine, doubling its speed for sixty
seconds. Overdrives and redlines drain power very quickly, and will damage components if overused."
69,,400CP,Toxicology,Prototype,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The Blackwatch can not keep hiding all the good stuff for themselves! Through some highly illegal means
you managed to obtain information on Bloodtox and some of the other poisonous projects that have
been hidden from the public eye. This can be used in later jumps to quickly determine ways to target a
single organism to create a highly effective toxin against them, or by creating technology that has their
most well-known aspect of it as a function."
70,,400CP,Xenotechnology,STALKER,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You have a very technical mind and you've been able to apply your theoretical degree in physics to good
use. You're able to incorporate artifacts and pieces of artifacts into any technological devices you may
know how to build with a lot less spontaneous death and irradiation than you normally would. This
allows you to build things like featherlight power armor, accelerated gauss rifles and other technological
marvels."
71,,500CP,Commencing Operations,Franken Fran,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"As an accomplished surgeon, you know the best ways to cut people up and put them back together with
a minimum of fuss and damage.
Cosmetics Make people look just like their dreams come true. Grecian perfection? Sure! Picasso's
Cubism? Take a number! The only limit is your imagination! (No augments apply)
Transplants Transplant fully functional organs between genders, ages, blood types and species.
Biochemical barriers, what's that? Organs must be mostly intact.
Trauma If they're still warm and bleeding, they ain't dead yet. Not when you get your hands on them. I
can't say much for their condition, but they will stabilize.
Disease You practically write the book on contagions, lord knows how many you've made. Even
knowledge of parasites and poisons won't be far from you. A cure is swift to follow.
Mental Through drugs, surgery, hypnosis and or therapy, the mental scars are as much your domain as
anything else. Cure neuroses with year-long processes in mere days or hours, resolve memory loss and
even carve personalities and minds to any shape.
* All five are included in the perk cost."
72,,500CP,Valkyrie Core Knowledge,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Valkyrie Core Knowledge (500CP) You understand the science behind Valkyrie Core technology. You'll be
able to replicate aspects of its technology such as the ability to store and modify objects in a pocket
dimension or the manifesting of Impeller fields, or the insane processing power of the Core itself. With
time and a little work you'll be able to make new cores.
Valkyrie Core & Frame (0CP) All origins possess a Valkyrie Frame with the accompanying core. A Valkyrie
Core is capable of storing, integrating, and improving technology and equipment. Its only limitations are
storage capacity and complexity both of which grow with hours synced. Your initial storage and
complexity is based on your origin with more experienced origins having more. The term Valkyrie Frame
usually refers to a core that has integrated a suit of enhanced power armor that has been equipped with
thrusters, weapons, and other equipment. Technology foreign to this universe is harder to integrate and
upgrade. Post jump this limitation disappears."
73,,500CP,Skill Level(Tech&Mechanic related),Rance 02,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"All living beings with a soul that are born within the Planner Scenario have Skill Levels set by birth. Even
those who hail from other planets or dimensions gain this upon entering the world and never lose it.
Nearly everything has skill levels, including daily skills such as cooking and cleaning. Skill levels
determines the expertise of the person's skill in any given field, or better said, their talent at the skill.
While levels are increased the more one trains, skill levels are set in stone by birth, and do not rise or
fall.
* Level 0 (Free)
Makes the individual capable of effectively doing the task normally, but without any particular aptitude
for it. Most people tend to have dozens of skills at this level. ◦ Level 1 (100cp)
Relative talent that lets the user perform the skill up to a professional level, while it’s not bad by any
means, one shouldn’t expect to gain fame with this alone. For example, Sill Plain possess a Level 1 Skill at
Magic, while she is decent in the magic arts and can use it effectively in battle, there’s a lack of power
and versatility. ◦ Level 2 (200cp)
At this point the user is a genius at their skill. More than enough to create unique signature abilities.
Respected swordsmen like Rick Addison or Rance have a Sword Combat Skill of Level 2, it what lets them
create their special attacks. For comparison Shizuka Masou also possess a Level 2 Skill at Magic. ◦ Level
3 (500cp)
This level is basically legendary, and the user is the best of the best at the skill. Few people in history had
a skill at this level and their potential is insanely high. As example, Annise Sawatari has the Magic Skill
Level 3 and easily overpowers any other mage in the Continent. Even with little finesse and experience,
the raw power of her spells can easily exceed the combined effort of 2000 mages."
74,,600CP,A Doctorate in SCIENCE!,IOU,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You're a multi-disciplinary genius in the field of mad science. Not only can you apply the pure discipline
of science to almost any non-sapient phenomenon in the universe, deriving from this the basic
principles, but given a few hours and a laboratory you can also work out what loopholes might let a
cunning engineer work their way around any limitations. In any other university, this would have you
laughed out of academia before you got anywhere - but this is IOU."
75,,600CP,Engineer-Rated,Generic Lewd Sci-Fi,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"There is no system aboard your starship that is beyond your ability to design, repair, or mutilate into
something else. From drives to shields, weapons to teleporters, you’re the master of them all. You are
especially good at improvising items of technology from each other – in case you needed to turn a power
ratchet into something that vibrates very quickly, or a weapon from your work tools. Mind the captain
doesn’t reprimand you for misuse of equipment, though. There may also come times when “she’s givin’
it all she’s got!” but the captain’s telling you he needs more. You can charm and seduce a short-lived but
vastly-increased power surge out of a spaceship, vehicle or other big machinery with some sweet words
and the promise of special maintenance work later. You just have to treat her right the rest of the time,
and maybe do some maintenance that might be considered a bit lewd if another engineer found out
about it – like hooking up the manifold array to the modulation bypass system, or giving those bolts on
the bulkhead down on C deck a good hard tightening with the biggest wrench you’ve got. You can be
sure that if your spaceship has a spirit, personality or AI of its own, they’ll be sure to notice all the
attention you’ve been paying to what’s beneath their surface."
76,,600CP,An Adaptive Enemy,Eclipse Phase,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You have taken the lesson of the Exurgent Virus to heart, and have made a breakthrough in programming
viruses and other malware. By combining your malware with the neural models found in AGIs, you have
the knowledge to create adaptive, digital smart viruses with just enough self- awareness to value their
own continued survival. These smart-viruses are a head above the usual Kaos AIs, capable of working
cooperatively, and in a creative manner, discovering and exploiting new weaknesses in software thrown
against them, and overcoming obstacles or setbacks in the way of their high-level goals in unexpected
and new ways. Even if they altered their own programming, you always retain Administrator command
privileges over them."
77,,600CP,Certified Tech,Fallout,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You are one of the brightest minds of the 23rd Century! You now understand Pre-War science, and can
even reverse-engineer existing technology to learn how it works, and how to recreate it. Plus, if you can
learn the basics of truly alien science, this perk helps you master it the same way."
78,,600CP,Everybody Experiments,Generic BDSM,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Normal people who experiment sexually might kiss someone of the same sex or buy a strap-on to bring
to bed. However you have found that your partners can be incredibly inventive in other forms of sexual
experimentation. This perk enhances the ingenuity and technical skills of those people interested in you,
allowing them to produce safe and surprisingly enjoyable results so long as the product is intended for
sexual purposes. While not permitting results beyond what technically could be accomplished by the
individual without this perk it does allow a broad range of enhancement depending on the world or
person. DIY sex machines would work smoothly without hurting anyone, a car battery and cables could
be used for electro-play without risking damage or heart attacks, a modified charm spell could set your
mood to 'horny', that makeshift chastity belt is incredibly hard to escape or bypass, etc."
79,,600CP,Cobra-La background: Biotechnology,G.I Joe,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You were born of the nobility of Cobra-La, an ancient civilization that dominated the Earth and retreated
to a protective dome during the Ice Age. You left the Dome around the same time Cobra Commander
was sent out to try to destroy human civilization. If you take this option Cobra-La will be placed in the Gi
Joe setting you went to, and will be an issue at some point. Though probably in a similar vein to the
movie, but might be a reoccurring friend/foe. If you join Gi Joe or a drop in and take this option, you are
a traitor to your people and can expect a Spore bath if they catch you. If you are a member of Cobra,
Cobra Commander takes much the blame as he did in the movie, and you are not blamed for Cobra's
failure. Though Globius might have a low opinion on you depending on how you acted.
Cobra-la biotechnology: You leave Cobra-La with a fairly in depth knowledge of Cobra-La's biotechnology.
Its not all comprehensive but will get better in time. As such you can make biological items, weapons,
and vehicles equivalent to or surpassing their hard tech counterparts. You can also identify biotech and
will have a good idea of how it works and what it does. This would also apply to other Jump's with
biotechnology and means you can master those sciences easier. Even truly alien ones. By the time you
leave the Jump you can even upgrade humans into bio-soldiers in much the same manner as Cobra-La
can, and make truly impressive (also weird and bizarre) biotech."
80,,600CP,Construction,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You gain a complete understanding of modern UN technology and how to produce it. This includes
everything from standard infantry power armor, to battleships, to even modern archologies. You also
gain a large bonus to your Valkyrie's construction ability. With training and the right tools you could
construct advance equipment in your Core's storage space, such as delicate processor chips, or build an
entire town in a day like Anna."
81,,600CP,Master of the Forge,Niplheim's Hunter,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The greatest blacksmiths don’t just pound steel into shape, they also draw out and preserve the best
qualities of the materials their creations are made from, weaving them into the final product to create
powerful enchantments. A blacksmith who has mastered this technique can make a set of lingerie
tougher and more protective
than a full suit of plate mail if he has the right materials for it. Of course you could be boring and just
make regular armor with this technique too but where’s the fun in helping all those huntresses cover up
their delicious bodies? Different materials grant different effects to the end product, and not all of them
are necessarily offensive or defensive in nature. A suit of armor forged from the remains of a holstaurus
is pretty top-quality protective wear, sure, but it also has powerful fertility charms that cause the wearer
to lactate large volumes of cow’s milk (or cum, if male). In general though these effects will be of some
benefit to the item’s intended purpose: almost all items can be made to be self-repairing, armor protects
better, weapons strike harder or with different effects, and sex toys will... Well, use your imagination.
Following this jump you can use materials not native to Niplheim for your crafting needs. Who knows
what kinds of exotic effects you’ll create!"
82,,600CP,Cyborg Casualty,Dragon Ball,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"It's something of a niche science in this world, but technology required to make cyborgs (or androids)
exist. Perhaps you're an erstwhile student or colleague of Dr. Gero, or are your own particular savant of
science. You now understand how to modify humans into incredibly strong mechanical monstrosities,
able to hold their own against modern weapons with minimal effort. You even have an idea of how they
can continually use spiritual power like ki despite having mostly mechanical bodies. After some time and
study, you could even create these robotic warriors from the ground up without just modifying an
existing human, as well as base them off of templates of people you've met or known. Maybe even
robotic suits of armor with similar properties, if you worked at it enough"
83,,600CP,Genetic Algorithms,Eclipse Phase,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"As a product of evolutionary science and genetic modification yourself, you have learned to incorporate
genetic algorithms into essentially any software you construct. Genetic software starts out a little clunky
depending how good a programmer you are to start with but over time it evolves and improves itself to
suit its purpose, whether that's target tracking software that learns to ignore feints and decoys or a word
processor that improves its UI and file format to suit its users. The end result, after many iterations, is
something exceptionally honed to its purpose, without placing the burden on the programmer to get it
perfect the first time. Now take care: The transhuman mind is considered software itself, so tread
cautiously should you attempt to blend these algorithms with psychosurgery. Down that path many
Exhumans have already tread, and while each one certainly became better suited to their chosen path,
I'm not sure how many could really be called successes."
84,,600CP,Genius of Your Age,Sword Art Online SB,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Kayaba Akihiko, all told, is a genius. Not just in computer hardware, although the NerveGear and
Medicuboid inventions have revolutionised entertainment and medical treatment for terminal patients,
but also in the fields of computer software and code design. He was instrumental in the goal of crafting
artificial intelligence, serving both as the creator regarding top-down AI such as Yui and Cardinal and
massive inspiration and guide for the bottom-up AI known as Fluctlight. Now, you happen to be just as
smart as him. A revolutionary in electronic hardware and software design, able to recreate his inventions
and even improve on them with your own special touches (or perhaps just more time and prior working
examples), you possess all the knowledge and skills this one man was known for. Crafting your own
virtual worlds is now entirely possible, as is life born of electronics and computer code instead of flesh
and blood. The very secrets of the soul are now known to you, Jumper, in the form of Fluctlight creation."
85,,600CP,Green Energy,Zootopia,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Zootopia is a wealth of non-polluting energy sources. Primarily geothermal and hydroelectric, but
examples of solar and wind power are used as well. Not only do you gain a wealth of knowledge on how
to build these types of power sources, you gain the knowledge of all the infrastructure necessary to
bring that power to an entire city. This includes an entire bookcase of designs and schematics on
everything from solar panels to power poles. It even includes Do-It-Yourself videos starring Bob the
Beaver in whatever format you prefer. As an added bonus, you know how to make such power sources
30% more effective at half the cost. All you need is the materials and a few handy helpers to kick
everything off."
86,,600CP,Totally Scientific!,Bio-Weapon Quest,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The typical path of a mad scientist is one of many false starts, hoping for inspiration to strike and propel
the creation of your next invention. You are...not typical. Through a greater understanding of runic
circuitry and bio-augmentation, the extra-dimensional powers used by the Heart Warriors, Bio-Weapons
and therianthropes (and even Hakodesh-class therianthropes) are yours through the power of science.
You are not reliant on the heat of combat or sudden flashes of genius to fuel the creation of new
inventions, but instead treat both runic circuitry and therianthrope-based bio-augmentation as exact
sciences; able to be developed through steady, logical and controlled experimentation, repeated tests,
labwork, and countless cups of coffee. In a word, the magic behind the magical girls and monsters of this
world has become...science. As the extra-dimensional energy behind both of these branches is more of a
general power source, only your workload is the limit on the variety and types of inventions you could
create to utilize it."
87,,600CP,Guardian Angel,Overwatch,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Doctor Angel Zieger, also known as Mercy, was renowned as an unparalleled medical genius even in her
teens, being recruited to the medical division of Overwatch before she was even 18 and becoming the
head of a hospital even before that. Her medical skills have literally brought the dead back to life and her
technology is so advanced that it seems like magic. there is no one in the world able to even compare to
her in her area of expertise. No one, that is, save for you. Your base medical knowledge is encyclopedic,
your hands are almost mechanically accurate when performing surgery. Your technology is advanced to
almost impossible standards, including things such as a staff that can engage a healing stream to rapidly
regen people from a distance. Your knowledge may even allow you to slow the rate of aging"
88,,600CP,Hard Science,A Certain Scientific Railgun,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You have knowledge of Academy City's science and technology to rival a scientist with a doctorate and
several years of experience under his belt. you are much more intelligent, analytical, and can easily keep
your cool under pressure and rein in your emotions. You also gain a Doctorate's worth of Regular
Scientific knowledge in the discipline of your Choice. You know the inner workings of recoil mitigation
systems and powered armor, but your true specialty is the Esper creation and development process.
Given enough time, you might just figure out a way to get rid of the randomness inherent in the process
and give x person y ability. Training an Esper to help them reach their maximum potential is child's play."
89,,600CP,I Save the Best Invention for Myself,The Incredibles,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. Especially if you're a
certified genius, capable of inventing amazing technology and weaponry the likes of which the world has
never seen before. You will need considerable resources to create your best work... but countries would
pay through the nose to get their hands on even your lesser works, so that's not much of a limit. Soon
you may be able to create many great things including but not limited to rocket boots, explosives, death
robots, remote drones, actual learning AI, energy prisons, and even harnessing zero-point energy for use
in energy rays or to power your creations."

people. They commit murder and corporate espionage while enslaving the poor under the guise of
helping them and spreading order. But you must admit, their technology is rather impressive. Focusing
primarily on hard-light technology, they used this miraculous invention to create entire cities, which their
architects can reshape at-will. Knowledge of how to create and use this technology is now yours, though
the Vishkar corporation will likely not take kindly to this if they learn of it. not only can you create hardlight
technology, but also their other devices, including energy weapons, teleporters, and weapons that
utilize soundwaves to heal or damage others."
91,,600CP,Making Monsters,Pokemon Sword and Shield,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Although incredible, the study of fossils and their revival isn't exactly a new field of research. There is
someone in Galar making what some would call a breakthrough, and others would call crimes against
nature, relating to the field. Would you like to become a genius? On purchase, you will acquire a wealth
of information relating to fossil revival technologies, such as what the process of fossil revival entails and
how the technology works. In a more expansive step however, comes the knowledge on methods for
splicing pre existing life forms into something new. Although most of your expertise in that second field
comes from using fossil revival on partial fossils of different creatures to revive them as something
strange and new, you also have some knowledge on doing that through other means, though mostly as a
starting point. In addition to just being able to make such things, you're somehow quite skilled with
making sure this hybrid lifeform has the strengths and qualities of its parts, in spite of how unlikely it
should be for such things to even survive, much less thrive. Maybe that will help others ignore your
depraved acts."

the world a 'dose of truth'. You can mass produce the unproducible, creating chemical serums that
improve the human body far beyond the limits of biology. So long as you can analyze it, you can tweak it,
find cheaper alternatives for it, re- engineer it to the point of unrecognizability, get any of the bugs out
or add your own. This perk is most effective with chemistry but it also boosts your skill with potion
making, and all other alchemical pursuits.
Capstone Booster- Renaissance Man- You aren't just a world-class chemist, you are a one-man marvel of
scientific achievement for all of humanity's branches of science. You have an expertise in astronomy,
biology, computer science, engineering, geology, logic, meteorology, medicine, physics, psychology,
sociology, and more! Your ability to reverse engineer other tools of science is just pure magic! Finally, any
discoveries you make, or knowledge you have will continue to work other universes, no matter how
divergent physics and other metaphysics are."

in the mind. You can take the scans the specific skills of anyone and create a new Neuromod suitable for
human use. Skills can be recorded through mere observation utilising a device called a Psychoscope,
though the skill you wish to collect must be being practiced by the target or be a significant part of their
personality. A great musician doesn't need to be composing in order for you to scan him for his musical
talent, but if you wanted his ability to cook you'd need to scan him while he was cooking. It has also
been demonstrated to be possible to install abilities from alien biology, providing the user has access to
sufficient quantities of any special material the ability relies on and they're okay with hybridising their
biology with the species."
94,,600CP,Never Underestimate the Power of Computers,Superman,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Nor the power of... well, you. You are a complete and utter savant, a shining genius in the field of
computer design and operation. Not only is your talent at hacking and network manipulation such that
you could have whole corporations at your mercy twenty minutes after meeting a computer connected
to them, you have the design chops to build stupidly, unbelievably advanced computers yourself. In
future jumps too, your knowledge of computer software and hardware updates itself to the latest
languages and design philosophies, ensuring that you're always capable of designing wonders such as
what you can build here."
95,,600CP,Noetic Science,Trinity: Aeon,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You have engaged in a deep, in-depth study of the mechanics behind your new abilities. You are
considered an expert among the orders on the nature of both the Noetic universe, and to a lesser
degree, the effects of Taint on the world. You also have enough knowledge of the biological sciences that
you could modify or design new biotech, though you're still a long way from understanding the
Prometheus chambers. The Tesser drives that power the interstellar teleportation Modes built into the
Leviathan Jumpships are a little beyond you, but you'll figure them out with a few more years of study.
Perhaps you could design other kinds of biotech with limited Psi powers?"
96,,600CP,Omnidisciplinary,DOOM 3,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Atomic transmutation. Directed Plasma Containment. Terraforming. V.I. data analysis. Orbital Spaceflight.
Energy Weapons. The UAC Mars facility is a melting pot of a vast array of cutting-edge physics, and
you've mastered all of them or at least most - the Delta Labs aren't quite your cup of tea. If it involves
some sort of high-energy physics, you're all but guaranteed to have a decent understanding of it, and
after the fifth PhD you kinda stopped counting. This vast array of knowledge isn't quite enough to
(re)build the UAC's science divisions from scratch all on your own, but it's pretty close This Perk grants
you a 100CP stipend which you may use in the UAC Equipment Catalog section found later in this
document."
97,,600CP, Pagan Science,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You've managed to uncover some of the secrets of old, the very same knowledge that underlies 'Sakurai
Theory', the theoretical basis of the Symphogear system. With this knowledge, many of the more
mysterious functions of the Symphogears become clear. You can repair and install new functions into
Symphogears, that manipulate existing features, like forcing a berserk state or tuning it to raise
synchronization coefficients. What's more, your glimpses into Sakurai theory indicate some possibilities
of inducing Human-Relic fusion, but to complete the theory you'll need an existing test subject..."
98,,600CP,Robot Master Builder,(Mega Man Classic,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Exactly what it says - you understand the techniques to create the advanced body of a Robot Master, as
well as the programming to create a fully self-aware artificial intelligence and personality for it. Though
the robot masters you create now might only be able to match those of the first generation of Light
Numbers, this won't be the case for long. With time, these Robot Masters could easily be as powerful as
a certain machine by the name of Forte. Even then, making even better Robot Masters might not be out
of the question."
99,,600CP,SCIENCE!,Fallout 4,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The secrets of SCIENCE are laid bare before you! You now have the knowledge to build incredibly
advanced machinery, given enough time and resources; teleportation devices, working cryogenics
chambers, sentient AI, machines capable of cloning or creating living beings, even lasers that are blue
instead of red! You can also make pre-war things like Fusion Cores or Laser Rifles easily enough."
100,,600CP,Silicon Surgeon,Batman the Animated Series,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The age of analog is over; it's time to go digital! You're capable of constructing rudimentary AI, and with
effort can construct machines that think and feel like a human does; what's more, you're also capable of
creating machines and programs that interface with the brain, such as virtual realities. You're also skilled
enough to ensure that these machines won't harm those who use them or that they do. In time, you'll
even be able to make machines that control the human mind instead of the other way around."
101,,600CP,Superweapons,G.I. Joe),Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Your expertise covers the every growing market of weapons of mass destruction. Giant beam weapons
that can teleport people everywhere to controlling the weather, if it's meant to bring a city to its knees,
you know about it. All of these devices however will take a massive expenditure of manpower and
resources. Among rare elements that are the cornerstone of the device. Good thing you always know
where to get them, good luck with getting past those giant worms! G. I. Joe will never let you make one...
unless they need it to stop cobra's latest super weapon themselves... Your repertoire of doomsday
devices increases with the technology you are familiar with, you learn how to apply specialties to new
super weapons. Robotics could make giant robots that grow as they eat metal. To mutagenic spores that
could mutate the planet."
102,,600CP,The National Supers Agency,The Incredibles,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"The NSA, a government division dealing with the employment of superheroes. They are the one working
to arm, support, and coordinate the Supers when required. While currently they might only be
responsible for placing Supers in hiding and covering up when their powers are revealed... Their
expertise is still remembered, and now you too will have access to this. Coordination and formation of
Super-teams, bureaucratic expertise, and perhaps most importantly... the creation of technology to
support Supers. Machines to wipe memories, supercars, ion propulsion gauntlets, power amplifying gear,
and more is yours to create and design. All of these and more will come easy to you now."
103,,600CP,The Third 90Wisher,Girl's Frontline,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Being an ex-90wish scientist isn't mandatory, but your technological expertise in the field of androids is
on par with that of Persica and Lycoris, and in some ways is actually more advanced, as while they've
been playing with their specific technologies, you've cooked up something of your own. Any T-Dolls you
construct or at least participate in the design of can be upgraded with your personal brand of
improvements, whatever they happen to be. With the time and resources, Jumper, you could easily
develop truly sentient T-Dolls, or create models with military-grade toughness or firepower while
maintaining their cutesy appearance and attitudes, or something cooler, like tank-girls!...Wait a minute"
104,,700CP,Buildcraft | Railcraft | Industrialcraft,Minecraft,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Buildcraft (200CP) You aren't limited to building things yourself; given some basic supplies and some
redstone, you can use a system of gears and tubes to automate your crafting tables, create an item
sorting system, and build massive automated quarries capable of stripping the land of all resources down
to the bedrock. It'll take a bit to get started, but once you're up and running, you'll be sure to have all the
resources you need.
Railcraft (100CP) Instead of the crude minecart tracks you were able to make before, you are now able
to make properly sturdy rails, able to bear the weight of full steam powered trains that can pull a variety
of useful carts. Using a system of tracks and automatic loader/unloaders, you can automate the delivery
of resources and liquids from one place to another, or deploy 'railgun' systems to launch explosive filled
carts at your enemies! You can even create trains which automatically build their own tracks, or which
dig tunnels for you. You'll also be able to make massive steam boilers, with which you can power your
Buildcraft devices far more efficiently... given a nontrivial setup process.
Industrialcraft (400CP) Working your way up from simple machines, you are able to build a vast array of
advanced machinery, from the humble ore grinding Macerator, to the futuristic Mass Fabricator. In time,
you'll be able to build automated factory complexes, supply all your power needs with nuclear energy,
protect yourself with night impervious Quantum Armour, teleport between bases with ease, and
terraform vast areas to suit your whims."
105,,1000CP,Enlightenment,Assassin's Creed,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"You now recall some of your Precursor knowledge. Create items capable of running off nearby
brainwaves, lasers that can incinerate a grown man in a second, vaults that last megaton-range damage,
all with the appropriate materials."
106,,1000CP,I Am Iron Man | Retro-Engineer,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"I am Iron Man (400CP) You're not the ACTUAL Iron Man, but you could make a fairly decent knock-off.
Power armors, sonic cannons, holographic interface, laser weapons, repulsor technology, you have the
knowledge to build these things and more. Furthermore, you can think of different upgrades and
modifications to adapt to different situations much easier than normal when presented with a problem
that's hampered your technological progress.
Retro-Engineer (600CP) Your understanding of technology is so great that you've even learned to get
into the basics of tinkering with alien technologies. As long as you take the time to study something and
experiment properly, you'll eventually figure out a method for that tech you found. Whether it's taking
that weird glowing thing and powering your machines with it, or dismantling an alien robot and putting
it into a gun, you'll figure out a use for something as long as you put in time. As a bonus, you're skilled
enough in research and experimentation that you're far less likely to break what you're studying on
accident."
107,,1200CP,Universal Electricity | Applied Energistic | Atomic science | ICBM | MFFS | Modular Powersuits,Minecraft,Domain: Knowledge: Mundane,"Universal Electricity (200CP) Your technical prowess extends to sophisticated electronic equipment. It'll
take a considerable amount of setup, as you accumulate resources and bring your factories online, but
this level of tech is needed to support the most advanced and powerful of operations. The UE Core
includes Mekanism, Electricity Expanded, and ComputerCraft, and enables a number of other submods
that grant incredible technological power.
Applied Energistics (200CP) AE is the ultimate storage solution; instead of storing your items physically in
various configurations of folded space or pocket dimensions, you can store them digitally, in specially
designed matter energy storage drives. This is particularly expensive, and the systems do require a
constant supply of energy to maintain the stored items, but the convenience of having all your items
instantly sorted and delivered by an automated system is undeniable.
Atomic Science (200CP) UE systems are voracious consumers of energy, so you'll need a real source of
power to keep up with the demand. With Atomic Science, you can build massive Fission and Fusion
reactors to keep all your energy needs supplied... and then go on to build massive particle accelerators
to produce Antimatter and Strange Matter to push your technological horizons still further (or to usher in
the apocalypse with worldcrackingly powerful weaponry).
ICBM (200CP) Allows you to build a series of missiles, from shortrange handheld rockets to massive
ICBMs with practically unlimited range. Each can accept a wide variety of custom payloads, effectively
anything you can fit into the missile design; more than enough to deliver exactly the right weapon to the
right target.
MFFS (200CP) The Modular ForceField System gives you the tech to build forcefield generators. The
forcefields it can produce are exceptionally powerful and customizable; the ultimate defence for any
given location, at a correspondingly huge cost.
Modular Powersuits (200CP) Modular Powersuits gives you the tech to build fully customizable power
armour. Explicitly designed to be compatible with almost anything you want to integrate with it, this
provides an excellent framework on which to add all the tech you want to your personal protection."

proficiency, you are considered to be one of the absolute best transhumanity can offer in that particular
field. It would take a serious handicap for you to screw up at whatever this skill is. You can purchase this
perk multiple times, applying to a different skill package each time.
Skill Packages (800CP) You get the Gear for all Skill Packages you purchase. A skill package gives you
professional levels of proficiency in the main areas, as well as minor proficiency in related areas
(fanwank as needed). Eg: it would be safe to assume that someone with the Marksman package could
use a tactical network or mapping software to make sure they're in the right position, calculate bullet
drop at long range, or identify common guns by sight, in addition to the primary skill of shooting things.
