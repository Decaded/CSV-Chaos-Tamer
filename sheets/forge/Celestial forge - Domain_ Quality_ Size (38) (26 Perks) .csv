1,,200CP,Engineered to Scale ,Mousehunt,Domain: Quality: Size,"To date, the largest mouse that's been observed weighs in at a staggering 2400 lbs. To contrast this, in the same environment exists a mouse that barely weighs an ounce. Clearly a trap that works on the former would be ridiculously inefficient for the latter, but hunters will typically demand a single trap type, so they don't have to get used to different traps operating with different mechanics. You can address this problem during the production cycle by manipulating the size of your creation: making it twice as large or half as large, whichever is most appropriate.
Creations made this way do not require extra resources or additional tuning to function, and they'll function just as well with the size taken into consideration."
2,,200CP,Loaded Up ,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Quality: Size,"It's not enough to have what you need locked away back in the workshop, and even when you have time to prepare you often have to pack light. You have a particular genius when it comes to building and working with tools, gadgets, weapons, armor, and other personal scale equipment. Whether it's cramming a computing setup that would take up an entire workstation into something that a hacker can slap onto their arm for on the fly hacking, or taking a normal pistol and modding it until it's more lethal and effective than most military arms, you're able to cram a stupefying amount of effectiveness into easily ported packages. Your creativity, skills, and genius just seem to skyrocket when dealing with things in sizes that would hamper anybody else. Bigger doesn't always mean better, sometimes it just means cumbersome."
3,,200CP,Nanotech Wizard ,Ratchet & Clank,Domain: Quality: Size,"You acquire a basic understanding of the nanotech of this universe. Use it to fix yourself up when you get hurt, or use it on others. If integrated with weapons or armor, it gives them the capacity to upgrade over time and to potentially change their abilities."
4,,200CP,They Will Prosper ,Marvel Magic,Domain: Quality: Size,"Being able to make fantastical tech that can compete even with magic is all well and good, but is it really being put to optimal use if you're the only one directly benefiting from using it? You will find you have a knack for scaling personal technology to a larger size. Turn a personal shield into something that can protect an entire city or make your particle gun into a weapon of mass destruction. Of course, just because you can figure out the logistics behind increasing the scale of your technology doesn't mean you actually have the resources to make these plans into a reality -- and you can bet increasing the scale by a large degree will see a comparative increase in the cost of resources."
5,,200CP,Weapons Recombination Template ,Final Fantasy XIII-2,Domain: Quality: Size,"The shady dealer (Actually it seems like everything he's offered so far is shady) just shrugs when you pick this up. Apparently, it binds two weapons together, and allows you to shapeshift the weapon between either form. You're not quite sure how it works, but he demonstrates it to you by showing you how a bow can shift into a sword. You can't help but notice that it also turned into a Moogle afterwards...but apparently yours won't do that. Unless you throw a Moogle into the mix. Wait...does that mean..."
6,,200CP,Mecha-Shift Engineer | Scroll | Weapon | Cool Outfit ,RWBY,Domain: Quality: Size,"Mecha-Shift Engineer (200CP) You possess all the engineering knowledge needed to create, maintain, and upgrade the mecha-shift weapons that are used by Huntsmen and Huntresses, and how to apply these design principles to other projects. This translates to the mechanical knowledge to fit large complex machinery into very small forms, as well as machinery that transforms into different shapes like a sniper rifle shifting into a scythe.
Scroll (0CP) Remnant’s local version of the smartphone. It can call, video call, browse the web, and anything thing else that you’d expect a smartphone to do. Everyone’s got one. In addition to its basic communication method using CCT towers, it can also communicate locally with other scrolls nearby without them. It also serves as a data storage device and method of identification.
Weapon (0CP) Weapons on Remnant are mechanical marvels that typically merge several weapons into a single deadly hybrid. Weapons typically have separate forms that they can shift between, like a Scythe that can shift into a Sniper Rifle. There are exceptions to this rule, of course, but you can decide what you want your weapon to do below. Armor: Full Arm Guantlets, Common Object: Armbands, General: Collapsible, Dual Wield, Melee: Atlesian Steel, Armor: Reinforced, Common Object: Concealed Weapon, Durable
Cool Outfit (0CP) Your own badass outfit. Pick a few colors, a motif, and a general style of outfit. You now have enough of those outfits to wear them every day of the week. And why wouldn’t you want to? They look cool as hell. Once per month you may change the appearance of these outfits to another similarly-colored thematic variant."
7,,300CP,Factorissimo ,Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Quality: Size,"You can make buildings that are bigger on the inside. The larger the building, the greater the ratio of inside-space to outside-space. A small warehouse could be the size of a large warehouse internally (~5x isotropic linear scaling,) while an arcology the size of an island would be the size of the entire island chain inside (~1000x isotropic linear scaling.) The main problem with these is that they have limited slots for belts or pipes to go in or out. The expansion may be non-isotropic; that is it may be scaled by more in one direction than another.
You may also do the reverse and create a building that is smaller inside than outside, or smaller in one direction and larger in another.
The interior and exterior sizes of these buildings are set during the design process, and are fixed for all buildings of the same type. In addition, you can place these buildings inside each other, creating recursive expanded spaces.
You can pick one up with your Builder without breaking them. If you do this, any machinery inside is frozen in time, and any living being is ejected from space where the entrance was."
8,,300CP,Gadget Master ,ZeroZero7,Domain: Quality: Size,"You've been trained by Major Boothroyd at the skills of his job. You're excellent at creating and maintaining gadgets of all types. You can miniaturize nearly anything, and hide things in forms that... really shouldn't work. You can even make lasers! You're also good at coming up with ideas for unusual methods of assassination; beheading umbrellas, flamethrower bagpipes, and the like."
9,,300CP,Tinkerer ,RWBY,Domain: Quality: Size,"You're a whiz at maintaining, modifying and making things. Everything from Sniper Scythes to Toaster Ovens, as long as you made it yourself or had the blueprints on hand. Unlock the secret of Variable Weapon Crafting."
10,,400CP,A Matter of Scale ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,Domain: Quality: Size,"Let others joke about compensating, you know the engineering it takes to make war-machines function. Most devices work best in a narrow range of sizes, too big and they become unwieldy, too small and insufficiently powerful for the job. Either way efficiency drops off sharpy. Not for you. You can scale up weapons to level cities and slay Titans, or miniaturize them almost to the point of digi-weapons with no loss of functionality, and can do this for virtually any technology."
11,,400CP,Data Compression ,Hive Queen Quest,Domain: Quality: Size,"As an artificial intelligence being able to move, alter, and compress data is something more than a hobby for you, it is a way of life. As such you are so good at compressing data without harming its function that you could fit an entire artificial intelligence onto a pocket calculator if you had too and it would still work! Copying an entire database to fit onto a usb stick? SIMPLE. Be careful however the internal memory basically works as the life span of an AI, when it runs out the AI dies. Besides you never know when someone may catch on to your little tricks..."
12,,400CP,Dimensional Addition or Subtraction ,Generic Builder,Domain: Quality: Size,"While any Builder's claimed space may be stretched or limited according to the Builder's ability and preferences, you have an exceptional knack for expanding or shrinking the space inside of your claimed areas, chests that have several rooms inside of them, police boxes that are the size of a large house, a forest that has trails that are merely a block or two when they should be far longer or even turning that child's backyard into an entire magical forest with enough skill."
13,,400CP,Hybridization Theory ,Zoids Legacy,Domain: Quality: Size,"So one day you had a bit of spare time after your daily Zoid admiration hour. After taking a close look at your favorite Gojulas and your favorite Mad Thunder, you decided that if the Gojulas could wield the Mad Thunder's Magnesser Drills like an arm weapon, you could probably reenact that scene from the show you watched two days back on the professor's hi-def television. Those mechanics can slap on parts and scavenge however they like. You can literally merge two machines together into one, with twice the processing power as before. Mind you, Zoids typically won't respond well to suddenly sharing a body with another core and another mind, but you'll have ethical uses for this...right? For most mundane machinery, you don't need any power source besides your own, but be careful that should you make your machine too big, the internal power supply might not be enough to feed it."
14,,400CP,Macro Scale Engineering ,GALACTA DAUGHTER OF GALACTUS,Domain: Quality: Size,"So. Other species' science. Not that great. Really not that great. Even the ones that think they're amazing have a habit of being really inconsiderate about what size they make their stuff for. Thankfully, as a Plus Times One Million sized badass, you can fix it for them. Your existing mind is a marvel already but now you have a particular talent for scaling up existing science, magic and other devices or creations to a outright silly scale. You can even work a human sized mutant being into a planet scale organism that retains all the normal powers and intelligence of the original! Best of all, you're able to make your scaled up pet projects workable. They won't tear themselves apart from being made massively larger and stronger or unravel at the seams. They will probably need to really guzzle down the calories/energies now that they're so much bigger. But it's not hard to just get some pet food energy. What are stars for after all."
15,,400CP,Miniaturization/Efficiency ,Worm,Domain: Quality: Size,"You can miniaturize anything down to levels that any sane man would consider impossible. A fusion reactor the size of a watch battery would be the absolute minimum of what you are capable of, and you'd be able to make it far smaller than that. Your power also makes you a master of technological efficiency, anything you make needing barely any energy to run compared to what it should and continue to do so for a very long time. These specialties also make you a master of nanotechnology and similar pursuits. Of course you aren't barred from building something big like a giant robot, just that it'll be impossibly efficient and crammed full of more weapons and subsystems then should be possible"
16,,400CP,Profound Seal Storage Treasure Techniques ,Talisman Emperor-Mortal Dimension,Domain: Quality: Size,"While true understanding of the Dao of Space is something only possessed by Immortals, there are techniques available to those of lower cultivation which still come in handy. Knowledge of this particular technique allows you to create small pocket dimensions linked to objects, effectively allowing large and powerful effects and items to be contained within a small space. This also could be viewed as a mystical form of miniaturization, shrinking things to one-thousandth of their usual size, possibly smaller in higher cultivation realms or with comprehension of the Dao of Space."
17,,400CP,Sleek and Efficient ,The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain: Quality: Size,"Like a multi-tool, your creations are capable of containing many features in a small package. This isn't true miniaturization; you're not quite at the point where you could shove a moon-sized super laser into a wristwatch. Your wristwatch could, however, have a regular sized laser, as well as a decent computer and several other minor bits and bobs."
18,,400CP,Sohon ,Legacy of the Aldenata,Domain: Quality: Size,"Sohon is the semi-spiritual technique used by the Indowy to build all the best Galactic technology (like, for example, ACS). Sohon adepts are incredibly rare; of all 18 trillion Indowy, only a few hundred have the potential to become a user of Sohon at all. A Sohon adept mentally controls nanites in a special tank to grow the technology under their direction, allowing for chemical structures and molecular formations that... really shouldn't happen. While you'll never be a true adept (never ranking, for example, among human Mentats), you can at least utilize the basics, allowing you to repair Galactic tech and, with a lot of time and effort, maybe make a little of your own."
19,,500CP,Nanite Sciences | Nanite Removal and Control ,Generator Rex,Domain: Quality: Size,"Nanite Sciences (100CP) You possess in depth knowledge of nanite technologies. With sufficient equipment and resources you could produce and control nanite machines, possibly even recreate the nanite event or maybe figure out how to reverse its effects. But that would take a long time of additional study of nanites out in the world, still you might be one of the few who could attempt this endeavor. You possess no knowledge of the meta-nanites, and understanding how they work is beyond your grasp.
Nanite Removal and Control (400CP) Many in this world would consider this is your most important ability, you can control nanites and absorb them into yourself, reverting dangerous mutations and can help people regain control of themselves. At first however this power will only work on willing targets, and will not work on incurable, especially virulent nanite infested EVOs. However with training and time, your powers can grow to circumvent these rules. Your greatest limitation is the fact that as you absorb nanites your reservoirs fill to the breaking point, causing dangerous flare ups and rendering your abilities unstable. You can purge these nanities, but figuring out how to do so in a safe way with a large amount of unstable nanites may take some effort. After this Jump your nanites can be used to heal people, whether of wounds, diseases, or possibly even mutations or others turned into a monster. Success will vary depending on factors, a mystical curse is probably beyond your nanites, a really out of this world super virus might be cured, but that's iffy. If you happen to run into other nanites in other jumps, you could control and manipulate them as well."
20,,600CP,Bigger is Always Better ,Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings,Domain: Quality: Size,"You're a true visionary, even amongst the most celebrated of your peers your creations would be known as truly awe-inspiring things. Grace, realism, detail, you are almost unsurpassed in all areas. But you have a certain specialisation, one more suited for a Necrotect than any other. The bigger it is, the more complex it is, the easier it is for you to make it. The larger the tomb and more intricate its design, the less time it takes for you to have fully working plans drawn up. Even the actual construction becomes easier in the same way, with larger and larger constructions seeming to be more and more fortunate. Extra supplies turn up out of nowhere, the slaves are in perpetual good moods and shortcuts tha cut time and resources needed without lowering quality are found aplenty."
21,,600CP,Mini Machines ,Supergod,Domain: Quality: Size,"Advanced technology might be the basis of most superhumans but what if you can't skip all that and just fit a machine the size of a factory into a man's arm so he can break a castle with his fist? Pretty neat, I'd say. You have the ability to miniaturise technology to an incredible degree, fitting machines the size of small buildings into the hand or head of an ordinary human, without facing any loss in efficiency or effectiveness. If you then make them at the usual size, they'll be far better than they usually would as you pack so much into them. You're also incredibly skilled at fitting these machines you've made into the biology of living beings, creating effective and viable cyborgs."
22,,600CP,Prototyper ,The Polity,Domain: Quality: Size,"You're more than capable of inventing new and novel systems that integrate existing technologies in startlingly effective ways. Any fool can make a laser or a missile bigger; what you do is combine different technologies in new and inventive ways ; they thought Tenkian was a genius? Well he's got nothing on you. Whoever thought putting a shear-field on a missile was going to work? Here, you'll find inspiration for combining the Polity's technologies in new ways hardfields, antimatter devices, artificial gravity, AI subminds, Under-space tech, all the neat stuff even Pradortech. The technology of the Jain, Csorians and Atheter are still beyond you, however. After this jump, your inspiration works to combine different technologies from completely different origins into new devices, and removes the restriction on Jain/Csorian/Atheter tech."
23,,600CP,Pym's Protege ,The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain: Quality: Size,"You can synthesize and utilize Pym Particles to achieve scientific wonders; increasing or decreasing objects and living creatures in size, density, and weight. The exact details of how Pym Particles work are a bit fuzzy, perhaps even to Pym himself, but they seem to have near limitless potential. Growth for living beings is capped at around the size of a large building, while shrinking can go down to subatomic levels- inorganic things could potentially grow or shrink even further, but at extreme size differences the amount of Pym Particles required to sustain that size may outpace the benefit. As an added bonus, you'll also learn about Hank's ant controlling technology."
24,,600CP,"They're Like Legos, Right? | This Is How I Want It ",Kerbal Space Program,Domain: Quality: Size,"They're Like Legos, Right? (200CP) There's robust engineering, and then there's modularity. Pick one. Except for you - you seem to have the gift of designing methods that allow for seamless mixing and matching of modular technology that lack none of the parts incompatibility and fragility you'd except from such a design paradigm. While this seems focused on Kerbin technology in specific, a little work should have you applying such a paradigm to all sorts of technologies...
This Is How I Want It (400CP) Your capability of mentally designing items is vastly boosted. It's almost as if you have a mental idea space in the fashion of a construction bay with a lists of parts you have on hand that gives you an idea of what you can build at that moment... actually, that's pretty much what you have. As a bonus, you can mix and match parts in a manner roughly akin to legos, and giving you an idea of what would work and what wouldn't (and how much resources it would take to build). Mind, this doesn't mean that your mental creation will perform successfully, but it will function. As a final bonus, you can mentally hand-off the resultant creation to your Kerbals to build, and they'll do so without a mistake or screwup - meaning any snafu that results will be on your own head."
25,,1000CP,CHEAT MODE - School for Ants ,SimAnt,Domain: Quality: Size,"Miniature schools, tiny dojos and nano computers oh my! If you have the materials, then it becomes child's-play for you to build ant sized mechanical equipment as long as you have the materials available to you. Who knows what you can accomplish if you are already decently capable with minimization techniques?"
26,,1000CP,The Big book of Time and Space,The Slayer Gamer,Domain: Quality: Size,"Details the very beginning of the concept ""Bigger on the inside"". Is the equivalent of an elementary school science book for time lords. Reveals more relevant information as your intelligence grows."
27,,1200CP,Nano-Technician | Nanoforge ,Red Faction,Domain: Quality: Size,"Nano-Technician (600CP) Is it me or does nanomachines not sound like a word anymore? You now have a considerable talent in the field of nanotech. With time and study, you could recreate the Nanoforge, with dedication you could even improve on it. Keep in mind nanotech in this setting is exceptionally hard to work with, but can do anything from fixing a bridge, to disintegrating a starship, to enhancing human abilities.
Nanoforge (600CP) Typically worn around the wrist, this device is an engineer's wet dream. Using real-time scans provided by the onboard AI, the Nano-Forge emits nanites as either a proximity cloud or projectile globs that procedurally recreate objects nearby. This Nano-Forge is restricted to repair functionality, and it doesn't work on biological material, but it does have the precision to recreate delicate electronics and the like."
