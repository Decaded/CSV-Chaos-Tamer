1,,50CP,Beniemiya ,Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"It might just be something in the water, both what you're drinking and what you serve to the guests that adore every meal you make. You're a savant when it comes to making meals, not just limited to Eastern dishes either. With a little experimentation, you can make almost anything into a mouth watering feast for both the taste buds and the eyes. The real problem isn't making a good meal but keeping all these greedy pigs from eating you out of house and home. Don't even try making hamburgers around any blonde ladies, it never ends well. Now, while cooking good food is a prize well worth it, you do also have a more useful aspect here. By channeling magical energy into your tools and ingredients as you work, you're able to 'enchant' the meal with a variety of useful effects. A hearty beef stew that lets a warrior heal their wounds much faster than normal, sugary sweets that give people the speed of the wind, a mighty hamburger that temporarily bulges the muscles to greater heights. Even negative effects are possible, if you want to taint your food that way. They only last for a temporary period and the effects tend to be fairly weak without a lot of mana put in but it makes your food all the more popular."
2,,100CP,Cult of the Gun ,Enter the Gungeon,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"What makes The Gungeon work? Magic. Duh. But, it's a specific type of magic: Gun magic, magic that makes objects more gun-like, or that accentuates the gun-like traits of non-gun objects. Unrestrained, it can turn a gun-like non-gun object, like a mailbox, into a gun, granting it a projectile and a firing method. The Gungeon does this passively, but you know how to direct this ability and use it to your advantage, taking any kind of object, and making it into a ""gun,"" complete with the same perks that any gun-like object might gain. It's still fairly uncontrolled, with little if any say on your part as to what kind of weapon you get. How else do you explain, ""guns,"" like a mailbox that fires letters and packages; a banana that fires explosive bananas; a bee hive that fires bees(duh); a camera that deals room-wide damage, knockback, and slowing; a guzheng that fires arrows when played; a pillow that fires zippers and stuns nearby enemies when reloaded; a crate that fires anvils; or a compressed air tank that fires homing sharks?"
3,,100CP,Magic Charms ,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You can make ofuda with a variety of uses – sealing creatures away or just hurting youkai in general. Sealing ofuda can hold someone paralyzed in place or lock away spirits harmlessly inside inanimate objects. Ones designed to hurt youkai will sting quite a great deal and potentially destroy them with repeated applications. Though for all their utility, they’re still pieces of paper, and while creatures cannot normally damage ofuda that affect them unless they are very strong, ofuda are noticeably weak to wind and rain. In time you may learn how to craft others based off myths about shrine maidens."
4,,200CP,Advanced Materials ,XCOM 2,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"As you experiment the physics and rules of a world ideas for new materials come to you. Elements and compounds from different universes often follow the same rules after all, so it should be theoretically possible to mix them. While you are developing new materials for your projects you will instinctively know whether or not materials will be compatible with each other and roughly how strong they will be. You will not know the exact ratio or procedure you will need to perform to fabricate these exotic materials, and it's not guaranteed that every material will be compatible with each other, but development will be made a lot easier."
5,,200CP,Amulet Crafting ,World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Amulets, a more permanent form of magic, can also be enchanted by Mummies. Amulets can take many forms, from small pieces of jewelry to strips of paper. Making an amulet is a lengthy and expensive process, requiring much magical energy. Amulets can be crafted to ward against specific forms of damage, to improve one's attributes, or grant unique abilities such as cloud walking or invisibility."
6,,200CP,Artificer ,Masters of Magic,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You begin the game already knowing the magics to create enchanted items (other wizards can eventually acquire them) and artifacts. Additionally, these items cost half as much for you to make, and take half the time. This allows you to equip heroes you hire in the early game. In future jumps, this will provide a slight boost to the creation time and a reduction to the creation cost of magical items."
7,,200CP,Eight-Fold Geomantic Mastery ,Generic Exalted,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You possess the inherent understanding and skill with geomancy and the manipulation of natural energies such that you may now create manses in any area where such a thing could conceivably be created. The stronger the mystic or magical significance of a given place the more powerful the manse that can be built there, but even in the barest and most mystically barren areas you will still be capable of producing, given some time, a manse of the least (1-dot) power. The process of creating a Manse is tremendously faster for you than it would be for others, the necessary geomantic arrays and arrangements seeming to simply leap to your mind with a clarity of insight few if any could match. The Eight-Fold part of it is that you understand the methods for creating manses aspected towards all five of the elemental essences of fire, earth, wind, water, and wood as well as manses aspected towards solar, lunar, and stellar (sidereal) energies. Given time and effort you may discern methods for creating other types of manse, twisted mockeries of what nature intended, but such insights will take considerable effort, time, and resources to bear fruit. Taking this perk explicitly allows you to create manses even outside of Creation and, indeed, is the only way to create manses outside of Creation."
8,,200CP,Formations and Forging ,World of Cultivation,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The basics of forging a new talisman lies in formations, by taking rare and powerful reagents and materials you can create powerful talismans to focus your power and grant you certain abilities. In its simplest form you could create such simple talismans as the earth turning hoe that ling farmers often purchase to help in their farming, while the highest levels are often dependent on the amount of time and the materials used by the forge. Such things as the earth turning sealing disc that creates the pressure of a thousand catties (1300 pounds) worth of weight upon another person for each spin of it, or the turtle style buddha ring formation which can protect an island from foes can be created. Many types of seal techniques are open to you now, it wall depends on what you are willing to do to master them."
9,,200CP,Grudge Forged ,Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Ibaraki-douji created her favoured bone sword by tearing out the bones of many Oni and setting them into a forge of her own terrible flames for hundreds of days. A way of sword smithing only a demon could manage, a brutal and unrefined method that results in a brutal and unrefined sword. But that sword is powerful, near unbreakable and holds the furious grudges of the Oni sacrificed to make it, giving the weapon a deadly cursed aura. This sort of feat is much more applicable to your skills now, as you find it far easier to turn your own innate abilities to the work of crafting things. A dragon's fire improves the quality of things forged in it, rather than just destroying the entire workshop. Cooling a forged sword in your own Youkai poison will still cool it as if with water but also imbue powerful toxins into the metal itself. You are able to add your abilities in creative ways to your creations without compromising them. Better still, you're very good at focusing what you create to not harm yourself. Using the bones of hundreds of hate-filled demons to create a cursed sword would direct those curses at your enemies, not at the original wielder of the sword. No need to worry about life draining demon blades if you're at the source of them all."
10,,200CP,Innate Talent: Magic item creator ,Overlord - The Series,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You possess the good fortune to have an Innate Talent. Innate Talents are abilities that people are born with, and usually only one in two hundred people will actually have one. They can run the gamut of all sorts of things, though there is no certainty people will be born with an ability they will actually be able to make use of. For example someone born with an innate talent for learning magic doesn't actually help them find a magic teacher, and thus some innate talents may go to waste. Thankfully for you you can choose what Innate Talent you have from the following list. You possess the unheard of ability to have more than one Innate Talent, assuming you purchase more than one.
You're really, unnaturally, good at making magic items. If you know how to make something then you can make it magical. Spoons, bowls, armor, books, weapons, toasters, anything. You actually have to know some magic in order to enchant items with a magical effect, and you don't gain any skills in actually making items, so if you want to make magic swords you'll have to learn some magic and then how to make regular swords first. You can copy down into scrolls any spell you know, which others can use to learn those spells (if they are capable of using that magic system and put in the time to study) or use them as one-use magic items. Additionally any magic item you create will be marginally better than it would have otherwise been, regardless of whatever abilities you might have brought with you from other worlds. You don't have to have this talent to make magic items or spell scrolls, but someone that does have this talent will always be much better than someone that doesn't."
11,,200CP,Magical Books ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The art of spellcraft is one that requires an immense amount of dedication and in many ways talent as well. Learning new spells can take ages and this can easily drive many off or act as a massive constraint when time is of the essence. You've found a bit of a way around this conundrum, by imbuing a simple book with your understanding of the spellcraft you can create a magical item that when activated immediately passes this onto whoever activated it, though the book is consumed in the process. While this only applies to Elder Scrolls magic at first, you'll find that adapting it to other systems is an easy process and only requires that the process be fine tuned."
12,,200CP,Orb Alchemist ,Timespinner,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The use of Aura is a key part of Viletean culture, and Orbs are an important tool in that regard. They act as focuses for Aura, allowing for standard and empowered effects, compared to what someone could accomplish on their own. You have the knowledge and skills to be able to craft these Orbs, or similar magical focuses. It will generally take materials such as gold, silver, gemstones, or other magically conductive materials. You can also improve these orbs using bits of crystallized Aura in the form of elemental beads, or using similar materials you can discover in future Jumps."
13,,200CP,Origami Witch,Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"A simple art turned deadly in your hands. Years of experience in folding paper has certainly made you a master at creating even the most complex origami shapes, your skill growing to the point that it began to mix with your magical energy, turning into something much more dangerous. You can easily use magic to shape paper into a wide variety of forms, imbued with varying effects. Creating origami familiars from paper, dangerous enough to scythe through human soldiers, is a ground-level effect. Creating powerful shields from overlapping paper flowers, flight through origami wings, patterns that strengthen existing spells or apply curse-like debuffs to those pierced by the paper cranes are all possible. While your main skill lies with direct paper spells, you will also find it much more possible to place magical effects onto paper for use with your magic. Researching some form of Onmyoudo or runic spells could prove especially potent."
14,,200CP,Photomirroring ,Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Every Gishki wields their own Aquamirror. But these artifacts are mere replicas of the true Aquamirror, much weaker and limited than the original, even if they still function as potent foci for ritual magics. While the true Aquamirror still eludes you, you've become an accomplished crafter, and can easily replicate all sorts of magical artifacts in much weaker forms. I wouldn't be surprised if a portion of the Gishki currently active are actually wielding copies made by you instead of Noellia. Still, it's gonna take a lot more than this to improve on your copied designs, or even just make them easier to wield."
15,,200CP,Relay Artisan ,Age of Wonders ll,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The knowledge necessary to create the massive structures known as 'Wizard Towers' is not easy to learn, but not especially rare either. Indeed, all Wizards rely on these towers for their abilities - in particular the ability to vastly increase the reach of their magics by channeling their arcane power through gigantic crystalline projectors lining the tower's structure. Smaller, less powerful crystals are occasionally used as well, both as 'Magic Relay' structures at fixed locations and with special equipment used by champions of the various armies. You are a gifted artificer when it comes to creating such relays and projectors. Not only can you create such crystals, but you have mastered the magical theories behind their function to the point you could craft these magical artifacts from other materials such as wood or silver. As your skill increases you'll be able to create more intricate and efficient relays, reducing their size or increasing their range. With practice, you could craft gemstones small enough for a ring's jewel that could let you project your magic within a dozen miles of their location. Once attuned, the connection between a Wizard and the relays you craft cannot be broken, it will continue to function across any distance and even across dimensions so long as the relay remains intact."
16,,200CP,Relic Magic ,World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Much like amulets, relics are permanent objects that can be imbued with mystical effects. Unlike amulets, relics can be magical automatons or objects crafted to follow a soul into the underworld. Any relic crafted is bound to a single person when crafted and only functions for them. Relics can be as simple as a small model of a house that exists in full size within the underworld, small animated statues, or as complex as large guards and soldiers carved of stone, or even a special statue designed to allow a Mummy in the underworld to inhabit and interact with the living world."
17,,200CP,Rune Carving ,Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Necrotects themselves are usually inexperienced in the ways of magic. It's rarely their duty to cast spells or command rituals, yet they are often called upon to inscribe runes on a vast scale or otherwise prepare things for magical means. You're very skilled at creating structures or items that can be channelled or used with magic, even whilst lacking it yourself. If you had a mage or wizard on hand, you'd even be able to work in tandem effortlessly, crafting items or structures suited to that person's magic in particular, working even better for them than anyone else."
18,,200CP,Soul Shards ,Minecraft,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You know the dark arts needed to create a Soul Shard, which will eagerly devour the souls of those you slay. With enough of the souls of a given kind of creature, you'll be able to set up a Monster Spawner, which can release these souls as an endless wave of hostile creatures, ready to be slain and harvested (or perhaps unleashed upon your enemies). Alternatively, you might employ the Soul Forge to use these souls to create sinister Corrupted Iron, used to create foul equipment empowered by those you've slain."
19,,200CP,Wandmaker | Basic Techs^2 ,Starbound,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Wandmaker (200CP) There is more to life than just technology. You have mastered the mysterious process of binding elemental phenomena to seemingly harmless wands and staves, allowing those that use them to summon up fire or ice or acid or other stranger effects. With practice, the power of the effects your wands and staves can create will grow, and you could even manage to bind multiple effects to a single weapon.
Basic Techs^2 (0CP) Tech are special implants that give the user various abilities designed to increase their range of movement, which can be used at-will, though some of them do use energy. This perk unlocks the basic tech groups: Morph Ball, Dash, or Pulse Jump, along with the three variants of each of those techs. This also comes with a free tech station in your Warehouse / Spaceship, where you can switch between your chosen techs. You can decide whether the Techs that come with this are actual implants, or just innate abilities. Given time, you may be able to figure out how to implant techs in others as well, using your own as a basis."
20,,300CP,Artifice ,Avernum,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You have a gift for the creation of powerful magical items. As True Artifacts their magic won't ever run out, or at the very least won't run out for a very long time. What you can make is limited to your knowledge, your imagination, and your resources."
21,,300CP,Crafting ,Geneforge,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"There are various things that can only be created through the use of essence and hard work. Shaped equipment, puresteel, certain complicated tools and devices, and certain materials used in enchanting. You can work all of them, producing high quality goods from basic ore and hard work."
22,,300CP,Key of Artifice | Grand Artificer ,Lords of the Night Liches,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Key of Artifice (200CP) Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Artifice, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. The Key of Artifice allows liches who practice it to form a sort of reserve of artifice energy inside themselves that they can invest into items to create various Arcane tools. The amount of energy they can invest grows with each rank, but is fixed. They must recover the invested Artifice energy if they want to reinvest it in a new item. Normally it's somewhat annoying to reclaim energy from an item you don't have control of, but because you bought it as a perk, you may freely reclaim it at any time. Actually investing Artifice energy requires enchantment work and spending three parts Arcane energy for every bit of Artifice invested. A lich gains the ability to make items in this order -
Arcane Focus: An Arcane Focus can have a number of abilities depending on the amount of Artifice invested in it, and how those points are invested. Only the Lich who makes it can use it. It can store Arcane, though it's not as efficient as an Arcane Crystal. It can be made to regenerate Arcane on its own for a somewhat high cost in Artifice. It can be made into a tool that can hold spells for you. It can make your spells deal greater damage. It can make it easier to use Sorcerae. It can help maintain Arcana for you with a phantom mind. It can help protect you from the threat of insanity from overusing Arcana - though unless you take certain disadvantages, you're already protected. It can have any other reasonable power that is in line with these.
Arcane Crystal: These crystals can hold Arcane Energy, and are easy to move energy into and out of. No other function, but they are more cost effective for the amount stored then a Focus. They're made from precious gems, with the more precious the gem, the better a focus it can make. A simple one is in the 10 gp range, while the greatest ones are crystals worth 500 gp. Since you purchased this perk, it's possible for you to potentially use exotic / rarer / more expensive gems, but such would require research on your part.
Occularum: An Occularum is a kind of immaterial drone used as a spy or seeker. Appearing as inky globes of misty darkness about two feet across, their shape seems to hint at being a giant eye. They usually remain on the Spectral Plane, only called when needed. Even when called forth, they are immaterial presences, hiding in the folds between the Material and the Spectral plane. Made of the substance of thought and imagination, they can slip through the tiniest crack even in substances that can block the immaterial. They can't really be damaged, though they can be stopped by forces that guard against immaterial and extra-dimensional intrusions. While on the Material Plane, it will see into both the Material and Spectral planes at the same time. It can clearly see for a mile on the Material, though it has ten times the range of vision on the Spectral plane. It has all the same vision modes you have, and you can use any spell to detect or see things through it. They always have Darkvision, Arcane Sight, and Detect Magic active. Your Arcane rank determines how well they can perceive and notice things, with the higher your rank the better their perception, easily reaching into the superhuman range by the 2nd or 3rd rank. They fly at about twice the speed of a normal human running, with perfect mobility. They require a moderate amount of Arcane to create, and no investment of your Artifice potential. You can have a number of them in existence at the same time based on your Intelligence. You can call one down anywhere on the same plane of existence as you, though you need some way of targeting the landing, of which you know several methods. Finally they can follow simple instructions on their own, and can 'contact' you for clarification, or you can actively control them, and they're well suited to searches or as sentinels.
Greater Phylactery: An Arcane Lich who has achieved the penultimate technique of Artifice can create a Bound Phylactery, a greater form of Phylactery. There are many advantages to a Greater Phylactery. The first advantage is that they are far tougher than a normal Phylactery. You are always aware of where it is, as long as it's on the same plane as you. If it isn't, you're aware of what plane it is on. You always know when it's been touched by another being, and when it's taken damage. You can spend a trivial amount of Arcane to see the area around your Phylactery, and maintain that vision as long as you concentrate. Your Phylactery can also store up to six motes of Arcane energy, and regenerates a single one each day. You must be able to touch it to draw on that Arcane. You may also set up to six spells upon your Phylactery to trigger on contingencies you define. If they activate dangerous damaging spells, your Phylactery won't be harmed. You can hang six spells inside your Phylactery to draw upon when you need them. You don't need to be touching it to draw upon them, but it does take a moment of concentration. Creating a Greater Phylactery ties up an entire Rank's worth of Artifice Points.
Bound Phylactery: The most ambitious liches won't be satisfied with a 'mere' Greater Phylactery. A bound phylactery isn't an object, it's a place. A house on chicken legs, an undersea palace of impossible geometries, a mountain. It takes physical work through the entire structure to be bound, and an investment of resources directly proportional to the volume being bound, but there is no limit on size. In return, a Lich can bind themselves to something that isn't carried so much as lived within. Here are some common properties that show up in most Bound Phylacteries.
* You can see from anywhere on or in it, as if you were standing there.
* You can teleport to any part of it for a modest cost in Arcane. You can be perfectly accurate with the spell as long as the destination is within or on it.
* You can cast spells through it, as if you were there.
* You can manipulate space and dimensions inside and around it.
* You can make it shift and cause parts of it to move. If it's built correctly, you can make it walk la Baba Yaga's hut or Howl's Moving Castle.
* You know everyone who is in contact with it, and where they are.
* It regenerates at 5% of its total 'health' per day if damaged, and you can speed it up massively by meditating on making it fix itself.
Bound Phylacteries are grand works of Artifice, and they tend to have unique properties in addition to these. It binds two whole ranks worth of Artifice points to make a Bound Phylactery. In addition to those more permanent constructions, Liches with the Arcana of Artifice also learn the technique of Arcane Enhancement. This essentially lets the lich turn prepared objects into enchanted objects with a temporary enhancement based on your Arcane State. As you bought this as a perk, you can always treat it as the final Arcane state (Spectral Lich), for an enhancement bonus of six on the item. You don't have to use the full bonus, as the higher bonus you use the more expensive in Arcane it gets. Such tools are Arcane weapons or armor. The Arcane Trait makes them especially good against the forces of the Void. In future worlds, it will work against forces of unmaking, oblivion, and the like, as well as undead in general. Weapons with the Arcane trait ignore defenses and immunities. Armor is stronger and helps you resist magical attacks. Other items are harder for forces of the void to resist. Who knows what incredible things you'll to make as your mastery of Artifice continues to grow?
Grand Artificer (100CP) While every artificer will continue to grow in the amount of Artifice they can keep invested, your growth is doubled here. More than that, you find you can permanently empower things, freeing you from having to maintain an ongoing investment. It takes a fifty-to-one ratio of Arcane to Artifice to replace the Artifice investment, and you can't empower something beyond your theoretical maximum Artifice - how much you could invest if all of it was available for you to use at one time. Using this, it's possible to make Arcane Foci that other people can use. As long as all the investment is permanent investment paid in Arcane, then you can set criteria for who or what can use it. Note that there aren't a lot of limits on what an Arcane Foci can do. You can also make an Arcane Enhancement permanent. It requires ten times as much Arcane to make it permanent as temporary. Such enhancement overlaps with standard enchantment, but does count as the required '+1' needed before other special abilities might be added, and an item so enhanced is considered an Arcane Enchantment for the purposes of ignoring anti-magic and spells. Yes, you can make an item a permanent Arcana Foci with interesting abilities, make it permanently Arcane Enhanced, and then enchant it. Something like that is basically a minor artifact though, and represents a huge investment of time and effort, without other perks."
23,,300CP,Key of Golems | Unliving Soldiers ,Lords of the Night - Liches,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Key of Golems (200CP) Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Golems, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. Golems are a common tool for the Liches of the Guild of Wizards. The greatest are the semi-real Artifex Golems of the Order of Artifex, but making them is hardly limited to just those master craftsman. The common Arcane Golem is created from a Heart. These Golem Hearts are crafted from precious stones and metals, growing increasingly grand for more impressive Golem Hearts, and then they're empowered with an investment of energy. A lich may temporarily invest part of their Permanent Arcane, tying it up in the empowerment of the heart. They can reclaim that investment at any time, but the heart will break and must be crafted anew. Alternatively, if the Lich also practices the Arcana of Artifice, they may instead invest Artifice into empowering a Heart.
A lich may only have a limited number of hearts in existence at once, restricted by the height of their Intelligence. Once empowered, a golem heart is very similar to a Occularum, though unlike those devices it has no sense of its own. Instead, it can bind its now immaterial essence to a piece of the world, and reshape that piece into a Golem. Such crude golems might be relatively weak on their own, but can channel a shadow of their makers might and skill. If destroyed, the Heart is dissipated from reality into potentiality for a time, but will reform after a day. It's also possible to build prepared vessels for the Golem Heart. Such vessels are far stronger than an ad-hoc animation, and the destruction of such a vessel will not dissipate the Golem Heart, letting it jump to a new vessel immediately. That strength though comes at the cost of, well, cost. Resources and time and effort to craft such. A Crystal Golem for example may be a juggernaut, but it's also a ten foot tall statue made of diamond and platinum. Making it costs. Obviously you are not limited to just Crystal Golems, and can use other materials you have access to, with more powerful and exotic materials tending to result in more powerful and exotic golems. With effort even things like the mighty and near indestructible Adamantium Golem may be in your reach. You may see out of the eyes of your Golems (or roughly where their head is, should they not have eyes), and project your mind into them to control them directly. They can obey simple orders and routines, and make fine guards and wardens, if unimaginative ones.
Unliving Soldiers (100CP) Your Golem Hearts aren't LIKE Occularum. They are an extra set of Occularum, with all the abilities of one. Even when invested in matter, the Occularum part keeps watch around its golem, seeing and spying. They also gain real, if unimaginative, intelligence. They're as smart as a somewhat dumb mortal, but they're perfectly logical and throurogh, and they feel no emotions that would make them perform badly. In the end, they're surprisingly good at working around their limitations. They also reform in only six hours, and they're better at animating their bodies than normal golem hearts. They might have the same basic attributes, but their reflexes and skill at using those attributes is improved. Occularum abilities are described in the Key Of Artifice perk. Should you also possess the upgraded Key Of Artifice perk you may make these Occularum Golem Hearts without a permanent investiture of Arcane or Artifice energy, though it does still require an expenditure of such energies during the initial creation."
24,,300CP,Soul Smith ,Dark Souls,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Well for one, this makes you a pretty good blacksmith with an emphasis on repair, able to repair most normal weapons, armor and trinkets with the right materials and a bit of time. You're also pretty good at forging and upgrading normal weapons and armor. There is more to this craft than you would first think, as Smiths in this world are capable of several unique acts. In this land, smiths can use special stones to imbue weapons with various types of power, such as Fire or Lightning, during the forging process. Given enough time and practice, they can even forge powerful souls into their handiwork to create unique and often times powerful equipment. While this skill doesn't make you the best in the world at this craft, it gives you a solid foundation with room to improve."
25,,300CP,Spirit Painting ,Earth Girls,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Your paintings and artwork catch a little piece of their subject's soul in them. This isn't harmful at all in itself. This link between the subject and the artwork might have all sorts of effects. Someone whose picture you paint on a cave wall might always find their way back to it, painting a couple together might make their relationship long-lasting and happy, or painting big-tooths and boars might attract those animals to your village's hunting grounds."
26,,300CP,Talisman Adept ,Inukami,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,You are very skilled at using talismans. What that means is you can make them have different properties (like light or sound) and with enough time and training you can make truly devastating effects. You are much better at using talismans and can give them properties of what shape they are in. Shaped like a frog? These talismans can bounce towards their intended target.
27,,300CP,That Undefinable Thing ,Tales of Symphonia,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Even if you can't describe it, you can still manipulate it. You can now make physical tools and containers for souls, as well as gaining the knowledge of how to use the soul as a power source for magic, machinery, and living bodies. Given proper resources (raw souls), you can create Exspheres and Key Crests which can then power the things mentioned in your place. Anything powered by their user's soul is known intimately to them, inhabited by the soul the same way a body is inhabited by a soul. It becomes in all ways an extension of the self, for good or ill. While the soul is infinite, it can be diminished and grown. Take care."
28,,300CP,The Arcane Craft ,Sword and Sorcery,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"As much as you might look down upon brutes and barbarians who know only how to break bone and spill blood, you and the warriors of this land have one thing in common. You require the tools of your trade. You know all the methods and ways to bind arcane and mysterious forces into physical vessels. Rings, staves, talismans, warded stone towers, and even more. These items allow the channeling of such forces to work your will, capturing, bending, and shaping the worlds invisible tides to enable works of sorcery and occult splendor. The strength of these items and their effects rely on your skill, knowledge, and power. Of course should you yourself be a font of such forces from your varied lives then you would be surely capable of building the focuses and talismans to augment and amplify your power. The world rewards men for diligent labor. It would behoove you to refine this art to get everything you can out of it. This also includes the skill to use such items, even those not made by your hand should you have the ability to reveal their secrets."
29,,400CP,Artisan of Moonsilver ,Exalted - The Lunars,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"While their tattoos are perhaps the most important artifacts any Lunar will ever bear, they are not the only artifacts in use by the Lunar Exalted. Not by a long shot. Many wonders have forged of the protean metal that is Moonsilver, exploiting the full potential of this mutable metal. These items are invaluable for the Children of the Moon, for they can change shape along with their owners. Indeed, many older Chosen of the Moon regard the use of moonsilver as the exclusive right of their kind. These elders tend to take a dim view of anyone else possessing moonsilver artifacts and may seize such items for themselves or to pass on to young Lunar protgs. Still, many young Lunars find they will have to create their own panoplies, for their elders often hoard these artifacts to themselves. It is a good thing then, that you are an exceptionally talented artisan, a master in all the mundane crafts and even further genius at working the mercurial Moonsilver that responds best to you. You have been granted the secrets of creating artifacts from that changeable metal, as well as how to make mundane armor into the Moon-Faced Mail that likewise shifts to fit whatever form you are currently wearing. Even the most important technique of the No Moons is known to you, the Form-Fixing Method that binds the moonsilver tattoos to the body of newly reincarnated Lunars."

And all of these things exist. But before them all, the truth of the Arcane is simple. It is the Fire of Creation, the Spark that flares into the infinite possibilities of existence. It is a force of Making, and you are utterly in tune with that aspect. When you use Sorcerae to Create something permanently, it only costs two times as much as it does for a transitory thing instead of the ten times it would take normally and such works always have a grace to them that makes them subtly better than they should be, and if you could succeed at such a Sorcerae, you will do so with grace and panache. You might call it a 'natural 20.'

Frankly, with the materials available and the tools there, it's more of a surprise that it hasn't happened already. Of course when you actually try it, you'll realize why -the magic surrounding the crystals is simply too strong to be forged using traditional means. But if traditional means won't work, that just tells you that you need to employ more esoteric means of forging. Forging not with traditional fire, but with the concentrated essence of Aether and fire crystals, you can bring to life a suit of armor with crystal alone -retaining its Aether collecting properties, and magnifying the effects of spells all around it. Perhaps with time, you might be able to make golems with this"

You are able to use complex crafting techniques capable of granting a simple steel blade an edge sharper than should be physically possible, but you've also learned to imbue your foul energies into that which you create. You begin by attempting to create an axe, and as the process goes on, you find it growing bone-like spikes and a gem on its guard which exudes a terrible malevolence. That its edge cuts the soul as much as it does the flesh is almost an afterthought once you wield it in battle and find yourself with an unnatural lifeforce that sees your wounds slowly mending even as you fight. You try to forge a weapon of two conflicting natures, and your own hateful being serves as a buffer that forces the entire thing to stay together despite it quite literally desiring to be sundered. The results are certain to be as varied as they are powerful, and you may learn to use this same corrupting technique with any other energies you may have. Keep in mind that you are literally pouring a portion of yourself into your work before you try to outfit an army. Hahsh Izh omoz, groth hollom chron voth icha Izh."
35,,400CP,Deplorable Forge of Tormented Souls | Hammer Upon the Wailing Muse ,Exalted - The Abyssals,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Deplorable Forge of Tormented Souls (200CP) Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. While the willingness to do so must come from yourself, almost everything else can be bought right here, providing you with equipment and inexhaustible supplies of the raw materials ones need to forge a soul into steel.
Full usage of the craft requires artifacts to forge the metal, a hammer and anvil composed of soulsteel or jade (whichever you prefer) to hammer the molten ghost-alloys into shape, another artifact known as an Essence-forge to melt down the unfortunate ghost's corpus and other materials, soulfire crystals replete with essence to stoke the forge, and black ores taken from the Labyrinth to grant it the ghastly, magical strength of soulsteel.
Even the alchemical agents, wrought from the Labyrinth, which are needed to create the rarefied void-coated plates of Oblivion's Panoply are in refilling supplies amongst these, should you have need of them. With this, the only thing you would still require for your dread craft is a supply of souls to feed your forge.
Hammer Upon the Wailing Muse (200CP) Much of the Underworld's economy rests on the production of soulsteel, one of the magical materials, which can only be produced by combining shavings from the walls of the Mouth of Oblivion with the melted corpus of a ghost. Forging soulsteel is difficult for even the best smiths.
Soulforging is the process by which the souls of the dead are melted down and then shaped into useful items or are used to produce soulsteel. First, the corpus of a ghost is carefully heated with soulfire crystals so that it can be reduced to a viscous state without damaging its integrity. Once liquified, the corpus can be smelted with other materials and then worked into any shape appropriate to conventional metalworking.
Soulforged items normally have the consistency of mortal steel. However, if the liquified corpus is smelted with molten ore taken from the Labyrinth, the result is soulsteel, one of the magical materials... and the only one that screams when struck with the smith's hammer. Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. Understandably, soulforging is a heavily regulated art. But one you have mastered to extent rivaled by only a scant few amongst the dead, able to forge souls into proper soulsteel, combine soulforging with jadecrafting to forge sophisticated artifacts, and having gleaned the secrets of creating Oblivion's panoply, jealously guarded by the Deathlords. Though you would need to delve deep into necromancy to put the latter into actual practice."
36,,400CP,Doors that lead elsewhere ,Dungeon Keeper,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Magically speaking, here and there are rather relative concepts, so why not take the easy route and build a dungeon that's here, there, and a little bit of somewhere else? While one cannot breach hellish boundaries with mere stonework, an auspicious floorplan can evoke the environments of other worlds through well-established principles of magical sympathy. If built precisely, the barriers between dimensions can become thin indeed within your dungeon, making summoning, teleportation and other exercises in dimensional manipulation almost effortless...and much more hazardous for your enemies, their own such spells at the risk of going awry in the worst ways and possibly drawing the ire of things best left undisturbed."
37,,400CP,Downsized  | Upsized  ,Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Downsized (200CP) While gems the size of a room are the most efficient and stable, this perk will give you the skills necessary to create gems that are smaller than that. The strength of a gem relative to its cost scales with its volume, so small gems might seem useless at first glance, but gems effectively do not have an upper bound for how high they can scale. Feel free to make an Orb of Presence fit for a backpack, and carry around a staff with a gem on the top for blasting foes, or launch gem bombs the size of grenades and leave behind gem-wasps the size of flies to distract your foes.
Upsized (200CP) While making gems the size of entire buildings is possible for normal wizards, they usually don't bother, since they have a tendency to cause widespread devastation when they break, and that can endanger the wizard that cast the spells. If you don't mind working around the potentially deadly consequences of summoning huge gems, this perk will give you the skills necessary to scale your gems as large as you want, so long as the entire thing can fit within your spellcasting range. Of course, you will draw a lot of attention doing this."
38,,400CP,Fairy ,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Despite having human parents, you are a long way from being human yourself. An ancient, long buried heritage in your ancestry has awakened and you were born as a Fairy. A Fairy is an extension of Gaia, similar to how the hairs or fingers on your body are an extension of you. Despite this, you retain your free will completely, thus allowing you to benefit quite significantly from being considered a natural part of the world, especially when it comes to your magecraft being accepted as entirely natural. You are also able to become invisible to the senses of any being without magic.
Beyond this, you have amazing talent in creating magic items and while you are right now a long way from crafting something like Excalibur or Arondight, you are still several times as skilled, fast and efficient in the creation of magical items as normal. Lastly, you have the potential, with enough power and/or age, to evolve into a full fledged Elemental, granting you greater authority and importance to the world, along with a not insignificant boost in power.
In future worlds, you may choose to have a similar connection to the world you begin on as you do with Gaia here."
39,,400CP,Fangs of the Beast ,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The greatest of warriors only become such with the greatest of tools, which themselves must be made from the greatest of materials. What greater materials could there be than those legendary finds at the end of quests, the mythical beasts that heroes slay or even the bodies of the hero himself? You are a master at the creation of all kinds of magical weapons, armour and items, capable of crafting even things like some of the magical spears wielded by the Knights of the Red Branch.
Your proper talents come to the fore when making items from the body parts of slain monsters or magical beings, allowing you to not only create results of far higher quality than normal but also to retain some or all of the magical powers inherent to the being you are using as materials."
40,,400CP,Fragmentation ,D.Y.N. Freaks,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The knowledge and process of creating Fragments has come into your possession. You're now able to turn individual or small, themed groups of your own powers or abilities into magical objects that allow other people to use those powers, bonding to the items, though you cannot make more than one Fragment for any given power. Though you can take these objects back at any time, those other than the bonded partner will find it very difficult to take out or even use the newly made Fragment. If you wish, you may make the Fragment slowly corrupt the user as they use more and more of its power, to the point that they eventually become either a beast or a mental and cosmetic copy of yourself, though they only possess the power you gave in the Fragment. Finally, you are able to moderate how much of the power you put into a Fragment that is able to be used, though you must still put the entire power in."

Whether it's Ghastly's protective clothing, woven razor Cleaver scythes, a magical prison like the Cube, Kenspeckle Grouse's life-annihilating Desolation Engine, sentient magical machines like the Engineer, or even the magic-boosting Accelerator itself, you have the skills needed to create them.

This will lead to a variety of effects, such as using Ripple to mend an ally's wounds. As well, you can infuse Ripple into objects. This improves existing qualities and makes them deadly to the undead and living alike."
43,,400CP,Jadework ,World of Darkness - Kindred of the East,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The Green Courts are so named because of the vast stores of jade, which is bought and sold for great sums of money, political favors or whatever else that the vampires need. It can be worked into powerful talismans and used to store chi, so it definitely has its uses. You've acquired the skill needed to make many (though not all) of the talismans, and could easily learn more. Jade, as you might already know, is valuable to Shen for many reasons, not the least of which its use in various rites and chi storage. You've got the connections you need to buy and sell, but raw materials are hard to come by these days. In other worlds, this could be applied to similarly rarified and functional materials, particularly gems or those used for or by Shen."
44,,400CP,Legacy ,Ravenwood,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"In this strange plane of existence, things sometimes take on traits they were never meant to take, a spark of something greater. You gain the ability to imbue a spark within an object, even immaterial ones such as songs, that allow it to build up, or awaken, a legacy. If such an item is used for a feat, it will gain a property based on that feat. A pair of boots used to run the length of a country to bring important news may gain a property to increase the speed of the one wearing them in some minor way. A shield used to block the fire breath of a dragon may develop the power to resist flames, and impart that resistance to its wielder. Even simply using the item for its intended purpose will make it ever so slightly better for that purpose, such as a sword growing sharper or armor growing more durable, though it could take years to accumulate a noticeable effect in this way. These legacy abilities may be fairly weak on their own, but they stack up over time, with greater feats giving greater improvements (Note: You are not required to perform said feats. Anyone using the item may build on the legacy abilities). Using this ability on an item that has already accomplished great feats grants these same abilities, only stronger based on the time since those feats were performed, retroactively."
45,,400CP,Legends In The Making ,Dota 2,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Many are content to find great artifacts with long and adored stories, but you've discovered the secret to creating them entirely. First, you have a modicum of crafting skill in nearly all areas. Swords, bows, armor, jewelry, while you're nothing to speak about you get the job done. However, sell a sword to a strapping young lad. Now sell a shield to some mercenary desperate to make more of his life after the boy dies, then sell a bow to some look. It might take a while, but you're going to make something for someone made of sterner stuff than most at some point, and that's when your craftsmanship shines. A knight using an armor crafted by yours truly slays a dragon despite being bathed in fire, then finds his armor having a design resembling scales once it cools down. Then, he discovers his armor quite literally drinks fire, heating up to harm nearby enemies while leaving him cool as a breeze. A ranger using a bow made by you shoots a monstrous avian in the wing from an absurdly long distance, and now any arrows fired from said bow home in on its target's weak points, seeking to cripple them. So it is, that when legendary Heroes are born, so are legendary implements. Curiously, those supernatural tools you inadvertently create always return to you, seemingly desiring for you to grant them new wielders. I'm sure you can figure out how to profit from this."
46,,400CP,Material Hybridization ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Hybrid materials are the newest and hippest thing to come to Eorzea, since the presence of stolen Garlean magitek technology showed up. Now Alchemists all over Eorzea have been experimenting with this stolen technology, trying to reverse engineer the material and fundamentals behind the creation of such things. A worthy venture, and one from which you've perfected the art of making hybrid materials. Not a matter of making alloys, but making ores and fabrics enchanted with the elements, creating resources fundamentally tied with the Aether. firemetal, watermetal, the hybridization is limited only by the complexity of the element, and the nature of the material. You can't expect to succeed every time, but you'll never succeed if you don't try."

Not only is it easier to talk a spirit into inhabiting your creations, any silver weapon you create never dulls or breaks in battle. They also deal twice the damage to any creature vulnerable to silver. Outside of this jump, supernatural creatures that take damage from your silver weapons are wounded as if they are vulnerable to silver."
48,,400CP,Pocket Master ,Luck of the Draw,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You have a rather interesting talent for building 'small' pocket dimensions. The more power you have when creating the dimension the more you can customize it, making it larger, move at different rates of time or have strange and or interesting effects like a wall of mist around the edges that allows you to walk into and out of on the opposite side of the pocket dimension. With enough practice, you could even include aspects of the world of dreams in your dimensions."
49,,400CP,Providence ,Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 1,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Ah, what an interesting trick. There is far more power in your body than one might expect. Quite literally, actually. When you give away part of your body willingly, the part so removed becomes akin to a magic item, holding supernatural abilities appropriate to the relevant part and your own wishes at the time of creation. Perhaps a cut of your mane large enough to use as a cloak could grant another your durability, or a scale from your legs could be used to grant them your speed. Of course, having more esoteric abilities will let you grant more esoteric effects. A fang capable of shattering enemy spells, or perhaps a claw capable of shooting beams of force when wielded like a sword? I won't presume to know everything you're capable of. Still, these items can't last forever, and every use of them will bring them closer to the breaking point. Equipping someone before they go on a monthslong journey is well within the cards, but I would not hope to stockpile these if I were you. The lingering will left inside those magic items will also make sure they can not be used in ways you'd disapprove of, as well."
50,,400CP,Pylonist ,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The Pylons are special devices that ordinarily require the presence of several people living around them to be used, and can only be bought from someone living in an area. Now, however, when you spend a bit of time within a given 'biome', you gain knowledge of how to make a special stand out of materials found within that 'biome'. Once properly constructed and placed within the biome, a glowing crystal will appear in the air above the stand. You are able to instantly teleport to any such Pylon that you have constructed, and you can allow others who touch a Pylon to use them as well. You are only able to teleport to Pylons that are on or near the same planet as you, and only one Pylon can be constructed per 'biome type' on a given planet. That said, you can leave the planet and return and the Pylons will still be there."
51,,400CP,The Science of the Soul ,The Games We Play,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The human soul is the oldest and most mysterious subject discussed by man. In this world, its existence is a proven fact, and anything that exists can be subjected to the pitiless processes of science. Like the Angels of ancient Babel, you are greatly skilled in the study and understanding of the soul, be it humans, animals or stranger. Just as someone would test and interact with chemicals or bodies or metals or whatever, you find yourself capable of designing devices and methods that can interact with souls, and things like them on the same level. You can measure them, diagnose them, operate on them and do pretty much anything else you can imagine to them. With time and some research, you might even be able to construct your own custom made souls from free Sephirot like the Angels once did, perhaps even custom designing it's abilities in the far future."
52,,400CP,Unlocking the Soul ,Dark Souls 2,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Perhaps you have more ambition than just bestowing the mundane with mystical power. You aim for higher, you aim to transmute the power of souls into tools to be manipulated by your hand. Was I correct? Then look no further. You have been bestowed skills and abilities that allow you to transform souls and spiritual power into a variety of ways. The most basic is using weaker souls, and crystallizing them into Lifegems, objects that can mend and repair flesh when broken in hand. The basic is just an example however, but a good one. Crystallizing souls, making their essence physical and widening the potential to interact with them. With such abilities, powerful souls can be transformed into weapons and trinkets, or golems powered by batteries made of souls."
53,,400CP,Writ of Worlds ,Exalted - The Infernals,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"All things that enter under the influence of the Sphere of Speech dissolve into whispering glyphs that hang upon the air, writings that spell out their own identities and qualities in the numberless languages that are Elloge. Within her inner realms perception and travel are difficult for intruders hailing from conventionally physical realms, requiring them to acclimate themselves to formless aural or textual existence so that they might explore the peculiar volumes of her inner spaces. Drawing upon some of her power, you may spell out the identities and qualities of those things you would like to create. Instead of physical means you may use your own writings to create objects of symbolic reality defined by the whispering glyphs. Forge swords of biting retorts, traps of erotic expressions like barbed hooks, cryptic devices, winding paths of efflorescent prose, and even living beings like savage packs of itinerant paradoxes and koans. All these may be created by you, even if the creation of permanent literature requires the same care that the forging of artifacts would, lest they reach the end of their narratives after some time in an unwritten world."
54,,500CP,Mo Weapon Master | Holy Mo Forging Pool ,World of Cultivation,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Mo Weapon Master (200CP) The way the Mo forge their weapons is unique from how Xiuzhe create their talismans. Through the process of forging already high class materials the Mo forging method focuses far less on creating a weapon with specific new traits, and focuses far more on emphasising and enhancing the properties which already exist in the materials by forging them in the deep cold flowing waters of the Mo Forging Pools.
You are now a master Mo Weaponsmith, able to look at a pile of materials and bring out the absolute best of what they could be, enhancing the traits they would naturally have if you forged them. A dagger forged from a beast which breathed fire will have a fiery aura, or even possibly burn upon touch of the blade, while more complex things such as a sword made from the tongue of a rotten undead carp soaked in the water of a necrotic realm may be able to cause things in a small area to decompose. Through hard work and study you can do much with this art, and should you have other means of forging or creating weapons the results will only grow more impressive. Also comes with the knowledge of how to create a Mo Weapon Forging Pool.
Holy Mo Forging Pool (300CP) The Underground Nether River is silent, it is 60 feet wide and spectacular to see. The river water of the Underground Nether River is as sticky as glue, is black yet clear, and flows without making a sound. The water in this river is extremely suitable for the creation of Mo Weapons, by placing a part of yourself or another creature as well as a weapon into the waters you can guide them to merge and create a Mo Weapon, a weapon connected to you much like a talisman or a flying sword, though often times more powerful, not because of superior forging techniques but because of the superior materials conglomerating to create a weapon.
The pool has the special property to not only work well for forging Mo Weapons it also has the effect of combining multiple weapons or items into one, as Xiao Mo Ge did with his Sky Snake Ten Transformations Pike. Doing this imbues all the powers of the items into one while allowing them to shift between the forms of up to ten of the items used in its creation. For example the Sky Snake Ten Transformations Pike was a powerful Earth Mo Weapon created, but its real power came from its ability to shift into ten different weapons in an instant. Now you can create something similar.
When used to forge with the parts of a creature it forges a better weapon depending on how strong the creature was and has minor affinities based on the creature and part used. For instance using the claw of a fire dragon will probably create a fire attributed Mo Weapon ranging between a dagger and a sword (considering how big the claw is). Though weapons created will be much more impressive if you have some training in forging already
After the jump it can become a warehouse attachment should you wish it."
55,,500CP,Order of Artifex | Useless! | Arcane | Sorcerae | A Memory Of The Face Of Creation ,Lords of the Night - Liches,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Order of Artifex (500CP) You have gained the Mark of Artifex. Your body becomes more drawn out, thinner. Long delicate fingers, sunken eyes. You develop phantom ink and oil stains on your skin, if you still have skin. At the end of the Jump, these effects will become a template you may apply or remove as you wish. But that's just your body, the thing you probably care the least about. You are of the Artifex, the great Craftsman of the Guild of Wizards. The true mark isn't on your body, but the body that you make, your Artifex golem.
But that’s just your body, the thing you probably care the least about. You are of the Artifex, the great Craftsman of the Guild of Wizards. The true mark isn’t on your body, but the body that you make, your Artifex golem.
Artifex Golem: An Artifex golem is crafted from a ripped free fragment of your intellect, will, and force of personality, damaging you when it’s first created, though this damage will heal over time. It also requires an investment of the same while you manifest it, though that cost is covered by you buying this perk.
An Artifex Golem’s advancement is normally linked to your Arcane State, but yours grows independent of that. A new Artifex Lich normally creates a Golem slightly weaker than a Flesh Golem, while a Spectral Lich creates something the equal of an Anaxim. 
Artifex golems, being made of thought rather than matter can be summoned and dismissed with a thought, but can only exist near you. Normally this would be limited by your Arcane State, but as you paid for this, you have the maximum range, like a Spectral Lich. You can manifest or send your Golem up to 200 yards away. 
Your Artifex golem shares your resistances to damage. You may transfer health to and from your Golem. You may also meditate to heal your golem at a decent rate.

All Artifex Liches excel at crafts, just being better at them then they should be. You also receive half again as much Artifice as another lich. You are also slightly better at Sorcerae that conjures or creates things.
Lastly, you gain the Arcana of Artifex. You gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Artifex, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth.
Artifex allows you to enhance your projected Artifex Golem, giving it the essence of different materials to further strengthen it. Magically pure examples of that element are invested in the golem, which are expensive to acquire and can normally only be purchased in Kethak, though nothing stops you from sourcing your own should you have other methods, or experimenting with more exotic materials.
The possible enhancements are
● Quartz for Strength 
● Granite for Armor
● Mercury for Dexterity 
● Platinum to grant it fast healing. 
● Diamond to make it tougher and able to take more damage 
● Sapphire to give it a freezing aura and make its strikes bite with cold. Incompatible with Ruby. 
● Ruby to give it a burning aura and make its strikes burn with flame. Incompatible with Sapphire. 
● Adamantine to make it resist all damage from lesser sources.
While the initial enhancement is small, it can be grown by binding a piece of mind and intellect to further grow that enhancement, with a greater binding allowing for more enhancement, capped by the lich’s normal intelligence. 
It can be enhanced further with Arcane energy, capped by the lich’s rank of accomplishment in the Arcana of Artifex. Finally, since it’s made of thought, you can basically have it manifest looking however you might want it to look, and since it is (very) technically a form of summon after being made, any abilities you have that enhance summons will also work on it.
Useless! (100CP) You find that your Artifex Golem is greater than others of its kind. Even when manifested, it is corporeal or incorporeal as would be most advantageous at that moment. A telekinetic barrier of intent deflects away harm, greatly armoring it based on your intelligence. You also find that you don't need to invest mind and intellect to empower it through the Arcana of Artifex - the fragment of mind you've invested to create it will maintain its own enhancements. You may still further enhance it by pouring in Arcana, to push it to the absolute limit. If your golem is destroyed, you can quickly rebuild it, and the personal cost is lessened, so that it takes only hours to recover from creating your Golem.

Through her own expertise, Noellia altered it into a tool for communication, hypnosis, and performing all kinds of rituals. While you might not necessarily have something worthy of your skills to use, you too have reached this level of prowess. Altering magical items to perform completely different functions is something you could do if given a mere month or two to study them. Simple tweaks, such as removing a fire scepter's ability to create fire to augment its ability to command fire, would require seconds at most. Actually improving an item is a lot more involved, and could take years of work to see any noticeable change, but is well within your capabilities, as is reverse engineering them outright."

Armagus on the whole are dangerous and unstable weapons if they're used by someone who doesn't know what they're doing, and creating them is no less dangerous because even one glimpse into the Boundary is enough to shred a man's sanity permanently. However, anything you make will invariably be better than anything you can buy in a store or on the black market.

But also extremely important were the potent magical artifacts he created, many of which serve invaluable roles as badges of office for the Sorcerer Supreme and tools for the defense of all existence. You understand just how powerful and important such tools can be, for you yourself are a skilled and talented enchanter. You find that imbuing items with powers is a simple matter for you, overlaying nearly any spell or magical ability you know onto some item to more easily invoke it yourself or even to allow others to do so. Though you are not yet as skilled in the creation of such wonders as Agomotto, this may yet change in time. Perhaps you will even find a way to permanently imbue living beings with your magic to grant them great powers of their own."
59,,600CP,Blood Artisan Plus ,Bloodborne,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You have been granted an experienced artisan's knowledge on crafting things out of blood. This is basically an overall improved version of Blood Artisan, allowing you to craft more potent Blood Vials, larger Blood Stones and even Blood Gems. Blood Gems are supernatural gems formed from blood that can be slotted into weapons to give them a variety of special abilities. Some Blood Gems can make an edge sharper, or a tip pointer. Other gems can bathe a weapon in fire, poison or electricity to make them more effective against certain enemies. Some gems can even increase your strength or dexterity while wielding the weapon it's slotted in. Their magical powers can be stacked, to an extent at least. This means you may slot up to three different Blood Gems in the same weapon, though no more. Blood Gems can be slotted and removed with special equipment."
60,,600CP,Code Creator ,Fate/Zero,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Many Magi rarely move beyond their own field of focus when crafting items imbued with magical power. What reason would there be when they could simply pay for another Magi to make something if they absolutely needed it? You're one of these skilled experts that others come to. Obviously in your chosen field, you're one of the great masters in creating magical items, such that something like Volumen Hydrargyrum wouldn't be hard at all, but even when it comes to fields of magic you have no knowledge in at all you can get surprising results. So long as someone with the requisite knowledge is nearby and willing, you can draw on their knowledge of the subject as you work, effectively combining your skills with their knowledge to become a master craftsman in fields that you have no knowledge of."
61,,600CP,Forge Wyrm ,Dungeons and Dragons the Dragons,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Dragons are often lazy creatures, sleeping away the centuries on great piles of wealth. But there are always exceptions. Some dragons choose instead to turn their minds to craftsmanship, and these can produce some of the greatest magical artifacts known to exist. Indeed, by combining your natural breath weapon, immense intellect, aptitude for magic, and a bit of either permanent investment of your own power or scavenged magic from other magical items, you may turn raw resources into any magical item known to exist, perhaps even artifacts who defy the known laws of magical items. This will, of course, take proportionately greater investments of effort and rare materials, yet to a dragon this is a lesser downside than it is to one of the shorter-lived races. Even so, for the greatest magical items it may be a long quest on its own to gather up the resources to even begin creating it. Of course, you will be able to find analogues to the raw resources in future worlds. You don't even need to work it directly with your own claws, for this comes with magic that can enable you to shape raw goods with exceptional precision and dexterity. Additionally, you are equally capable of leading entire teams in crafting projects at a time, perhaps organizing mindless golems or hired help."
62,,600CP,I Send My Sword ,Highschool DxD,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Something many forget in this age is that it was the hand of God that created the Sacred Gears, and granted them to humans so that they may work miracles on the world. The secrets of this art died with Him, but the impact they leave on the world has echoed throughout time and history. You have gained a shadow of this art, with the ability to forge Holy Blades...not True Holy Blades, but powerful weapons that burn away the infernal and cut deeply against Devils or wicked creatures. More than that, you have a sense of others besides yourself who can shape the course of history if granted such a weapon, or any power you can pass to them, and a very accurate idea of how they will change the world around them for better or worse. All it will take is a mysterious, angelic figure granting them what they need when the moment calls for it. In time, you may be able to forge True Holy Blades after some trial and error, forging kin to legendary weapons such as Durandal and Excalibur."
63,,600CP,Item Construction EX ,Fate Servant Supplement,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The Skill to manufacture magical items, from implements of war to items for daily use. The EX Rank represents something that falls outside of the numerical ranking scale, a value that cannot be quantified under the normal system because it is in a league of its own, powerful to the extent of rendering comparisons meaningless. (Descriptions taken from the Type-Moon wiki.) You have the knowledge and skill to build things rivaling anything seen in the Fate franchise.
EX: Able to make healing potions that grant true immortality, craft Kaleidosticks and other world altering artifacts.
A: Capable of making healing potions that grant limited immortality.
B: Production of devices that carry magic power."
64,,600CP,Jumper Crystals ,Date a Live,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The power that allowed the First Spirit to create the subsequent ones, or rather, a more refined version of the same process. By gathering enough mana and concentrating over a particular power or ability you possess, a small crystal can be made. These crystals can be given to others to allow them use the power you copied in there. While these won't convert the user into a mad monster (like the original ones), the process is still unfinished, and could alter the user a little (as partial memory loss) if their mind isn't strong enough. You can perfect the process, though it would take some time and research."
65,,600CP,Labyrinth Creation ,Fate/Extra,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The Moon Cell creates entire Reality Marbles to simulate each area in the Grail War, including the Lunar Seas where Servant Battles take place. While you're not able to replicate this incredible feat, you can being to create Lunar Sea like pockets of your own. While you can always decide the general theme to the dungeon and it's enemies, at first, these will be small dungeons, perhaps only a dozen rooms and connecting hallways, and filled with weak fodder that will only drop cheap items. As you grow more experienced, all these parameters will expand. Eventually you could create grand labyrinths with multiple floors and dozens of rooms a piece, enemies will grow in strength and their item drops will increase to match. You do not have any more control over this however, at most you may simply choose the general size and strength of each dungeon, nor will the enemies within ignore you."
66,,600CP,Magic Maker ,The Gamer,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"High class enchanted objects in this world are quite rare. While this is to be somewhat expected, they are also suitably expensive, due to the sheer difficulty in making them.
You now have the skill to do so. And as a bonus, there is no drop off, no 'you must have absolutely mastered fire magic to even create a weak fire enchantment', no 'hundreds of times the power requirement to create the item'. Any magical effect you know, you can create a talisman or item to replicate. Staff of nuclear fireball, ring of haste, anything you know, you can make."
67,,600CP,Magic Smithing ,Hellboy,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The Golden Army, the Crown of Bethmora, Nuada's Spear such relics as these are beyond the ken of humans. But you can not only understand their construction and the magic behind them; you can create wonders of your own. Self-repairing golems, magical artifacts that control them no matter the size of the horde, spear tips that inch ever closer to the heart and cannot be removed by mortal means and much more are possible for you to create now. Though, getting all that gold might pose a problem"
68,,600CP,Microcosm ,Greek Myth,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Like the shield of Achilles your creations can contain microcosms. You could place within a sword the power of a raging thunder storm, sing a song that carries the components of civilization that would allow it's most important ideas to be transmitted through it's words, even very complex ideas like how the men of Greece live and understand the world can be placed with a creation of yours. This empowers an item by allowing it to act in some way as if it were the thing imbued within it, albeit in a diminished from the form they are embodying. Striking a shield which contains a microcosm of Greece would be like trying to strike through Greece, being struck by a sword containing Greece would be like being struck by Greece. However the microcosms you place within items will be greatly reduced compared to the actual thing they are embodying. A song containing civilization would only be able to get across the most important ideas with very little nuance, a sword containing a storm would strike with the force of a single thunderbolt rather than the thousands within the true storm, being struck by a shield containing Greece would be like being hit by a mountain rather than a country. It would take incredibly intense effort to create anything containing a microcosm more powerful or complex then Greece."
69,,600CP,Natural Remedies | Artificer ,Twokinds,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Natural Remedies (200CP)  Academic pursuits are all fine and good, but mages need to make a living like anyone else. To that effect, most of the magically inclined make money by selling alchemical solutions and other plant-based compounds. Your knowledge of alchemy and herbalism lets you craft everything from common medicines to potent poisons. While not as powerful as purpose-built magic, these natural alternatives are the preferred purchases for all but the wealthiest of patrons. Any village would welcome an alchemist like you.  
Artificer (400CP) Of course, plenty of people will pay serious coin for self-contained magic. You now have the skill to build magical artifacts and constructs. These items can replicate any spell you are capable of casting, so long as they are supplied with sufficient mana. More powerful artifacts will require more expensive materials and longer construction times, but the demand for reliable, consistent spellworks exists in every community on Mekkan. Whether you make these devices for yourself or for others, your devices are only limited by your access to materials and arcane knowledge. If you have the Natural Remedies perk, you may now brew potions that confer spell effects. Whether you bottle an Invisibility spell or cook up a cauldron of Cat's Grace, your spells now come in a convenient liquid package."
70,,600CP,Soulfuse arts ,Talisman Emperor - Mortal Dimension,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"While some powerful artifacts have Immortal Spirits which can briefly animate them, these spirits are somewhat limited. Though all are powerful and many are intelligent, they cannot cultivate and therefore cannot fundamentally change themselves. The Soulfuse Arts break this limitation, allowing a loose soul to bond with a Magic Treasure as a body and cultivate with a potential of at least the Heavenly Immortal Realm. While these arts are normally practiced with existing artifact spirits, it is also possible to use them to bind other souls. At a minimum, this makes the treasures intelligent and capable of wielding themselves, though the latter is draining."
71,,600CP,The Master ,Martial World,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You gained enough understanding, knowledge and experience to start the path of an inscription, array and alchemy, with this you can create new recipes and method to substitute rare, extinct ingredients and materials with common ones but has same effect and effectiveness, you can also understand any pills, array or inscription that you see instantly and replicate it with less time and materials used, this also allows to invent pills, array and inscription from scratch when facing a difficult situation that a pills, array and inscription can help like breaking through the nine stars of dao palace, post-jump this applies to potions, seals, runes, barriers as well."
72,,600CP,Tool Creation ,Fate/Legends - Empire of Antiquity,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"The ability to make and alter tools at an astonishing level. Designing and crafting magical tools of exceptional power is easy, from potions to magical weapons to siege engines, and even creating non-magical implements that can accomplish magical effects at a lower level is entirely possible. You could with time, design and create some of the greatest weapons wielded by heroes in this age, provided you find the tools and resources you'd need to do it. Your talents lie particularly towards weapons of destruction and war, as your inventions in that area seem to end up having far more power, lethality and effectiveness than you had expected from what you designed. Lastly, when forced to spend time amongst other living beings, you also find that your capabilities with tools can be applied in certain ways to living beings, letting you trick and manipulate other people to do what you want with quite a high degree of skill."
73,,600CP,Weapon Synthesis ,Dark Cloud,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"By now, you've probably come to realize that the weapons in this world are quite peculiar. We're not talking about the Slingshot that speaks to you by the way, the Fairy King had a hand in that one. How does one crystallize a weapon? We're honestly not quite sure, though the magic seems to be consistent with the Atlamillia's properties. The crystals are surely a handy way to store the weapons - but you can also use them to merge into other inanimate objects, passing down a single property of the crystallized weapon as it were."
74,,800CP,Protodermis ,Bionicle,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You now know how to make the apparently omni-applicable material Protodermis! Ignoring The uses of a substance that can act as water, stone, metal, rapidly growing crystal, or organic matter as needed, the most prominent use for Protodermis is the creation of Kanoka. By pouring molten Protodermis into a frisbee-like mold and letting it cool, it attains one of eight powers -Shrinking, Enlarging, Reconstitutes at Random, Remove Poison, Regeneration, Weakness,Teleport, or Freezing. From there you can merge multiple disks to make a variety of other powers. Whatever power it has will be applied on sufficiently forceful impact. Kanoka retain their powers when forged into smaller pieces such as gears or triggers, and can also be forged into Kanohi. Kanoka power reserves last thousands of years but do eventually run out and require re-forging. Kanoka can be combined to have any Kanohi Power, as listed in the Notes section."
75,,800CP,Rare Talent: The Ability to Craft Ter'angreal ,Luck of the Draw,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You have a rare talent such as, a rather impressive animagus form, being a metamorphmagus, the ability to craft ter'angreal, you're a vampire slayer, identifying magical items by looking at them, dream walking, wandless magic, creating seeds for angreal, making Cuendillar/Heartstone, reliable foretelling, force battle meditation or the like. This may be bought twice per specialty, once is enough to give you the potential to be one of the best possible with your talent, twice is enough to put you in the realm of legends. If something requires magic to work you have the minimum ability you need in order to use your talent. In other words, you could be nearly a squib and have an animagus form or wandless magic. It's highly recommended that you pick up a decent magic source to go with your talents if they require magic.
* Generic magical items from wheel of time"
76,,800CP,Unshackled Potential ,Generic Fantasy RPG,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"You know, for all the advantages an adventurer from a noble background holds over one with a humble origin, there isn't much disparity in terms of power level when both reach the epic levels. That's because Adventurers in general possess a ridiculous amount of potential. You, however, are a whole different animal - where even the most promising of Adventurers will one day reach the apex of their potential and be unable to advance further, you will never reach the apex of your potential because you will always be able to improve yourself in every respect, whether physical, magical, or even mundane skills, if you're into it.
MYSTIC - The Artificer Magical artifacts, and perhaps even magi-technological artifacts if you know the right disciplines, come together under your hands and tools with the casual ease of a master. You can invent, develop, and introduce an item that can reproduce just about any magical effect you are personally capable of. While your initial prototypes might only just work, and not terribly well, you'll always be able to continually improve on your designs, with no particular ceiling in what you can manage beyond the time you're willing to invest and dedicate towards improvement. Furthermore, the rate at which you make improvements, and just design and build such artifacts in the first place, is tremendously enhanced, far beyond what other individuals that fancy themselves artificers could manage. Where the creation of magical items for the average practitioner is a long involved process requiring careful and painstaking effort, you are practically the equivalent of a one (wo)man production line. Finally, you may substitute pure magical energy for all but the rarest materials required during the creation process of your artifacts, though at an extremely unfavorable cost ratio until you dedicate significant time and effort towards refining this ability."
77,,1100CP,Crafting Classes | Realm of Heroes | Level 100,Overlord - The Series,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Crafting Classes (200CP) You now possess classes and abilities aspected towards and in the service of creating a specific type of craft or trade good, and will be able to easily come up with new recipes or innovations for the crafts you select. Examples include cooking, smithing, scroll making, jewelry crafting, and so forth. For 50 cp you may choose one specific type of craft, however for 200cp you may instead have crafting abilities that are equally applicable to every possible crafting pursuit. Examples include food and drinks that give low level buffs when eaten, low end (but still serviceable) magical weapons, armors, and misc magic items, and so forth. The sort of equipment that would be considered useful and practical enough (in terms of use and cost) for even a more experienced adventurer to eye them appreciatively and think them a worthy addition to their arsenal.
In the Realm of Heroes however you could make items that would be considered national treasures by the locals, things like swords so sharp that they could hit 'above their level' such as damaging someone that would normally ignore them (for example, bypassing the high-tier physical nullification of a level 100), rings of potent regeneration and stamina recovery, masterwork armor that even a hero would be honored to wear, food and drink that could potentially heal a man of injury instantly or empower him to staggering heights (temporarily at least), and so forth.
At Level One Hundred however your crafting skills have hit their zenith. At this point you could make items on par with Divine Tier equipment, things even beings of godlike strength would find no complaint in, or foods and drinks so nourishing that someone might not need to eat or drink for a month or more afterwards, and conveying extremely potent temporary buffs alongside that. However, of course, no matter what your level of skill one simple fact remains; your skills are largely worthless without materials to use them with. While you might be able to take even subpar ingredients and fashion something workable only with truly excellent materials will you be able to craft something genuinely great, especially at the highest levels of crafting.
Realm of Heroes (300CP) You have stepped into a realm that only the greatest that have ever lived can truthfully claim to be a part of.
If you are a Warrior you could potentially cut down an army of a thousand regular men all by yourself, and would be capable of feats of skill and martial prowess that would leave regular folk in stunned awe of your capabilities, and have them whispering that maybe you aren't a mortal at all.
If you are a Magic Caster you are capable of spells up to the sixth tier, believed to be the highest tier of magic that a mortal could possibly ever achieve. Spells of the sixth tier can perform things that would be miraculous to the common folk, such as resurrecting the dead, teleporting over unbelievable distances without error, summoning forth powerful creatures as servitors, or potentially casting spells that would let you defeat upwards of a hundred men with no more than a few words and gestures.
If you are a Generalist your luck, wit, cunning, and skill are so profound that you have an answer for virtually every situation, and while your combat prowess won't be as great as a warrior of the same level, and your magic won't be as good as a magic caster of the same level, you'll far outstrip anyone that isn't in the realm of heroes in those abilities.
Level 100 (600CP) You've hit the pinnacle. There is no higher level, not within YGGDRASIL at least. As a Player you have hit level 100, not exactly a surprise since most Players had done that, and represent the absolute peak of personal power and ability. If you're a Local then you're quite frankly a freak of nature and are probably seen as a god by any other locals that actually know what you're really capable of. Literally, by the way, the Slane Theocracy actually worships as gods a group of six level one hundred Players that appeared to them in the past, though virtually no one still alive outside the highest echelons of the Theocracy itself actually knows that. All level one hundred individuals possess high-tier nullification defensive abilities. This means that individuals won't be able to even hurt you that aren't, at the very least, within the fabled 'Realm of Heroes' and even then they'd have to be a hero among heroes to manage it, and they'd still have to get past your normal defenses even if they manage that much. The only hope they'd normally have is if they possessed access to some magical artifact of sufficient power to get past your defenses. That said the high-tier nullification is an all or nothing ability, either it works or it doesn't.
Your physical and magical statistics are absolutely mind boggling as far as the locals are concerned. Even magic casters, if they're level one hundred, will possess physical strength and defenses on par with a warrior that is 'only' in the 'Realm of Heroes', and warriors can expect to be far far beyond even that. Magic casters actual magic power is enough that it could literally bring even the greatest human archmage to his knees in awe and shame at his own weakness, were he to actually witness your true strength. Even warriors that only dabbled in magic would still be on par with magic casters in the 'Realm of Heroes' at the very least. The abilities of a Generalist, both physical and magical, will outstrip everyone other than their level 100 peers by a tremendous degree.
As a warrior you are capable of annihilating armies of tens of thousands of regular men on your own, and likely wouldn't even notice them. It would take legendary heroes or beasts to actually make you break your stride. You'll possess skills that will let you nullify certain damage types outright, perform swings of your weapon that can hit dozens of individuals at once with air pressure alone, and provide you with a myriad of defenses against magic casters that would seek to stymie you and prevent you from closing the distance. You are literally a one-man army killing machine. As a Warrior you additionally possess 'super moves' that can do things like grant temporary invulnerability to virtually anything, allow you to strike everything in your line of sight with a single powerful blow at the same time, or hit one opponent dozens of times with a single strike.
As a magic caster you are capable of casting spells of every tier up to the 10th Tier. This is a tier of magic that only a bare handful of people in the entire world even know exists, with most believing that 7th tier is as high as it goes. 10th Tier magic is the stuff of legends, capable of healing armies or slaying them, resurrecting the dead en mass, permanent teleportation circles, 'buffing' or 'debuffing' entire armies, summoning forth creatures of legend as servitors, and so forth. As a Magic Caster you'll also be capable of 'Over-rank Magic', also known as Super-tier magic, that exceeds even that. Singular spells that could slay 70,000 men in one go and then also summon massively powerful eldritch nightmares under your command at the same time, destroying entire cities with rain that infects those it falls upon with an undead plague, conjuring forth miles upon miles of enchanted forest that responds to your will and will empower you while you are within, or spells of similar such scale and effect. Unlike normal spells 'over-rank' spells don't actually cost mana and are more akin to skills, they always have a long casting time, usually a minute or so, and you must stand still and can not do anything else while casting them. Additionally you can only use them a few times per day.
If you are a Generalist there really isn't a question of 'can you do something' so much as 'how do you do it today, and will you do it differently tomorrow'. You're not quite on the same tier of skill as the warrior at combat, or the magic caster at magic, but you're just below both of them. Magic of the 9th tier is yours to command, and while you're not the combat beast a warrior could be you find that your command of both the physical and magical aspects give you a range of utility and versatility no one else could boast. As a Generalist you don't benefit from super moves or over-rank magic but in compensation your statistics are significantly better overall in the areas where the other origins would be weak. You do have one area however where you particularly shine. You are blisteringly fast. You could run circles around the warrior even if you couldn't beat him at swordplay, and you can certainly close the distance (or run away) from a magic caster in the blink of an eye. You've also picked up a penchant for sneak attacks, and opponents that don't see you coming rarely get the opportunity to learn from that mistake."
78,,1200CP,Soulcraft | Sage,Demons' Souls,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Soulcraft (600CP) With the souls of strong opponents, you may forge great weapons and armor out of them. Of course you can craft with lesser souls but the product won't be that great. The weaker souls can only be used to upgrade things instead. You instinctively understand how to use anything you made.
Sage (600CP) In magic you have few equals, many of them brilliant prodigies much like yourself. Your intelligence improves the damages of your spells. With study you can turn great souls into powerful spells to be used. Weaker souls can be used to improve your magic"
79,,1300CP,Ruinous Font | A Messy Process | Preservation of Ruin | Hemalurgic Genius ,Mistborn,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Ruinous Font (100CP) Hemalurgy is a dangerous and dark art, with a natural connection to the god of Destruction, Ruin. Through this connection, Ruin can manipulate the beneficiaries of Hemalurgy towards his own destructive ends. With this perk, you gain the tiniest sliver of Ruin's power just enough to fuel your own Hemalurgy without Ruin's help. Hemalurgic spikes you create have no connection to Ruin, and their users cannot be controlled by him or by emotional Allomancy. You can also make Hemalurgic spikes outside of this Jump. This does not confer any knowledge or ability with Hemalurgy you'll either have to take another perk, or find someone who can teach you. Unfortunately, the only people who can teach you are more likely to kill you instead.
A Messy Process (200CP) You have a basic knowledge of Hemalurgy. You know which metals steal which attributes, if you didn't already. More importantly, you have a basic knowledge of the bind points on a human body, and you have a superhumanly steady hand when preparing to drive sharp metal objects into someone's body, even your own. In addition to some minor combat benefits, you can safely use place a hemalurgic spike into somebody's body in the exact right location to avoid injuring them and allowing them to draw on its power. However, the ability to twist humans into nonhuman forms or to implant hemalurgic spikes into nonhumans is beyond you. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane.
Preservation of Ruin (400CP) You can now charge a Hemalurgic spike without killing the victim. So long as the metal touches their still coursing blood, energy will be drained from the victim to charge the spike, leaving them alive. A spike made in this fashion will be slightly less powerful, but will last longer outside a human body. A victim drained by this ability will become noticeably paler, and their personality will shift to become slightly more dour and less energetic. If the drained attribute is a supernatural ability, it is removed entirely if it is a natural ability such as strength, it is radically weakened. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane.
Hemalurgic Genius (600CP) You are a genius in the art of Hemalurgy. You have the knowledge to twist a humans form into a variety of shapes with Hemalurgy, creating entirely new creatures formed from the hemalurgic charge in the spike and the recipient's own soul. This process usually requires multiple spikes, and twisting a human too far from their natural form can destroy their mind. The more a person is twisted in this fashion, the more powerful the charge in their spikes becomes, enhancing whatever abilities they gain from it. You also gain the ability to find the bind points in any nonhuman creature. Creatures that are largely humanoid only take a few minutes of visual inspection animals can take hours of intensive study. Sufficiently bizarre creatures may require days or weeks, and you may need to perform vivisection or other intrusive and indepth analysis in order fully map the creature's bind points. As a side benefit, hemalurgic spikes you make are more efficient, storing greater chargers and degrading slower than normal. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane. Furthermore, attempting to use this ability without A Messy Process results in having very little control over the exact mutations your subject manifests. You know which bind points trigger mutation, but without the knowledge of which bind point does what you're largely striking blind. Experimentation can teach you, of course."
80,,1800CP,Maker's Prodigy | Maker ,Darksiders,Domain: Crafting: Magical Items,"Maker's Prodigy (600CP) The makers decide to teach you the ways of creation and you may choose to become their pupil, they will teach you how to create magical artifacts, imbue places and objects with power and even how to create magical constructs with sentience. Regardless if you spend the time learning from them or not, you will find you learn future skills related to creation, enchantment and forging will come to you as if they were second nature, waiting to be remembered.
Maker (1200CP) You gain an alternate form of a maker, broad, Immensely strong and around 12 feet tall. You also gain supernatural powers of creation, able to make impossible things from practically nothing. Though it may take many years of practice, you will be able to master the art of crafting life from clay, Forge magic spells from ideas of the mind, and matter from nothing. Creator's spark: If you ascend and receive a Planeswalkers spark, you will find your knowledge of crafting extends unto the impossible and the laws of reality. You may eventually create new worlds from the void and forge new forces such as a unique form of magic or entropy as you create the new plane."
