Engineering","Amongst the many sciences and paths you know, aside from the usual Ominous Cackling, you... Can
actually patch people up easily. As a Crazed Physician, you can use the plainest tools on hand to mend
any variety of wounds and injuries. As well, you know the human anatomy down to the last blood vessel,
and can learn the anatomy of any other creature you dissect more easily."
2,,200CP,Cultured,Generic Isekai,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","You're from another world, one vastly different from the one you're in now. More importantly, a world
filled with countless luxuries and entertainments. You have a natural skill for understanding and
reproducing any sort of food, game, toy, or other luxury item that you have personally experienced. Even
if you lack the necessary tools or ingredients, you can manage to cobble something together from what's
on hand. Once you get the hang of it, you can even figure out how to produce it cheaply and reliably, as
long as it's even remotely possible. And once you do that, it's child's play to introduce these foreign
delights to a new society. Give some orcs the joys of curry, or distribute othello boards to elven tribes.
It's fun and profitable!"
3,,200CP,"Dr Shen, I presume?",Endless Space,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","You are really knowledgeable at learning from your foes. You always seem to learn something new
whenever you salvage enemies equipment. New weapons, armor, agriculture, the works. Every piece of
enemy salvage you obtain gives you new insight into fields of science you had not yet explored. Beating
the crap out of a caveman won't teach you how to make new laser cannons, but it will give you new
insight into obsidian knapping methods, or animal hide tanning. Knowledge gained is related to what you
are looking at."
4,,200CP,Finger of Silver,Macross,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","While other kids were building tinker-toy creations, you were fiddling with your dad's car and doing a
better job than him. By purchasing this, meddling with machines and OverTechnology is as easy as
breathing for you. By getting your hands on something, you can easily figure out how it works and how
to copy its inner workings, provided that it wasn't just bullshit magic. The more advanced something is,
the harder it may be... but with time and effort, you just might succeed."
5,,200CP,What's This Do?,Titanfall,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","The technology used in the frontier can be so complex and advanced it takes years for even the most
brilliant minds to understand. Really now? That's good, you needed something to do after lunch today.
Now, even if you're in a dropship in the middle of a firefight, you can decipher the inner workings of
technology so long as you have the controls to scre- I mean analyze."
6,,200CP,Xenospecialist,Gears of War,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","The problem with fighting and violence is that it's no place for an egghead, and as a result valuable
information could be lost to a wayward grenade before study. You've taken it upon yourself to bring that
knowledge back, and as such you have an easier time understanding alien language and technology. It
won't give you instant knowledge, but as you study further you will find it becomes easier to
comprehend."
7,,300CP,Analysis,Adventure Time,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","You have the skill and insight to make powerful analytical tools. Such tools are capable of showing you
the physical makeup of the things you come across, detect magic and alert you to hidden doorways."
8,,300CP,ANALYSIS,Medaka Box Abnormal,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Understanding is by far the most important thing. Once you know what you're dealing with, you can
formulate a plan to deal with it. You're just great at both. You're able to effortlessly and intuitively
analyse and understand anything that you can see or touch. The more complex or strange the thing is,
the more time you might need to understand it, but even Abnormalities can be figured out with a few
caresses and a couple seconds of consideration. Your understanding tells you how and why anything
you've analysed works and then gives you the knowledge on how best to bring out its full potential,
letting you turn people or objects into the best they can be over time, so long as they're open to your
training plans."
9,,300CP,Clever Kitty,CATastrophe,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Earless tech isn't usually easy to understand, but for whatever reason the inner workings come to you
easily enough. You don't understand how every bit of Earless teknologee works, but you have the basics
down to an exact science. So long as the teknologee you're studying still adheres to the laws of physics
(though they may be ones you don't know about), you can with time and the right tools discern how it
works. Of course, replicating it without the proper resources will be a problem, as will the time needed
to recreate anything more complex than a toaster."
10,,400CP,Bolthole Protocol,Honor Harrington,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","While coming up with unbelievably advanced new designs may not be exactly your forte, what is is the
reverse engineering of the same. You need only spend a few moments working at something to get a
basic idea of how it works, and only get faster from there. No matter how advanced or obscure the
technology, you can eventually work it out, with a thousandth the time and effort it would take anyone
else."
11,,400CP,Diagnostic Manuals,Generic Factory,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","You will get a manual for the upkeep and repair of every object you own. Each manual will be detailed
enough to diagnose anything that could go wrong in normal use and perform repairs. Manuals for items
you buy with CP can never be permanently lost, but you will only ever get one manual for any object you
acquire normally- you may want to use a photocopier on those.
* Useful when using items in crafting sources outside of the CF."
12,,400CP,Enemy Tech Progression,Orion's Arm: The Amalgamation,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Any technological device that you have subverted will reveal its inner workings to you. The blueprints,
knowledge and methods that go into the creation and operation of the technology you subvert is
automatically uploaded to your mind. If you cannot subvert a technological device, you can still learn its
secrets, but at a far reduced rate. You are also able to more quickly grasp the inner workings of those
subverted devices to improve on, and upgrade them."
13,,400CP,Improbable Crafting Skills,Generic Isekai 4chan,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","You're an expert at recreating modern technologies with atypical resources. Even if you don't know the
full mechanics or manufacturing process for a particular item, you'll be able to craft it with local
materials or supernatural abilities through experimentation or sheer magical power. Post-jump, you'll
also have a much easier time interchanging materials and processes for technologies not native to your
original world."
14,,400CP,Lighter,Hive Queen Quest,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Given to the Red Queen by the Great Lee owning this lighter greatly enhances the rate at which you
research foreign technology, and can also start fires. Includes a small chain to hang it around your neck.
Fits all sizes."
15,,400CP,Reverse Engineering,Sekirei,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Bizarre alien technology, superrobots, genetic engineering. You might not know these disciplines, but
with just a single example to test to destruction, you should be able to figure out how it (used) to work,
how to apply the principles to new tech, and with a few projects under your belt, remake the original!"
16,,400CP,Reverse Engineering,Stellaris,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Sometimes other Empires are plain better than yours when it comes to technology and use of it. That is
where this comes in. As long as you can get your hands on a piece of technology, you can understand it
after several days of study. Another Empire has new lasers that outshine yours? Well all you need to do is
get your hands on a mostly working version and you're set to go."
17,,400CP,Reverse Engineering,Worm,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","While you still possess an amount of scientific knowledge beyond the curve of modern society, your base
technical knowledge is far less than other Tinkers. This is however because your power lets you reverse
engineer the principles and workings of anything you can get your hands on, and then apply that
knowledge and understanding to your own work. Just seeing a device and watching it function gives you
a vague idea as to how it works, and examining something means you can derive the hows and whys as
to its functions. This requires time and effort on your part, in addition to the time and resources it'll take
to actually implement this new knowledge, but as long as you put in the necessary investment you can
always understand virtually any new technology. Your Tinker abilities will continue to expand as you gain
access to new technology and knowledge, with potentially no upper limit as long as you can keep gaining
samples to work with."
18,,400CP,Salvage Savant,I Have A Mansion In The Post Apocalypse,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Inventing technology is well and good, but often, and especially in the Post-Apocalypse,there is much
more sense in working on comprehending the wisdom of the past. And you're brilliant at it now, with
this. Be it systems and technology from before the apocalypse or just wisdom and learnings about life in
a more general sense, when it comes to understanding what has been done before, there are few who
can beat you. You are also much luckier than usual at finding things to salvage; even places that
everybody else swore were 'picked clean' still seem to have at least a few useful items you can turn up.
No matter how advanced or obscure, the principles and secrets on which any given items or techniques
work unveil themselves to you with little more than a glance at the production action, as do any more...
spiritual or otherwise esoteric aspects of things. You could single-handedly gift the greatest glories of a
world's history back to them, with some time and effort."
19,,400CP,Magical Modifications,Fate/Loli Order,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Let’s be honest, you’re anything but normal. Chaldea doesn’t even hire normal, it only wants the best of
the best of the best to assist in their mission of preserving human history. If you didn’t meet that level of
skill, they would never have hired you. As it turns out, your talent is for modifying things. Jury rigging
equipment, a spell to be fire instead of ice, a curse to inflict pleasure instead of pain. Creating something
from scratch isn’t for you, but altering an already existing invention? Well within your grasp. Why, you
might even be able to take a hypnosis app and make it even more powerful.
* Note: This gives access only to mechanical versions of this setup."
20,,400CP,The Only One Who Bothered To Learn,Iron Sky,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Yeah, it might very well occur in this world that people would refuse to learn how to fix things while
living in a place where day-to-day survival depends on them and others fixing things in time. You have no
such problems, thankfully. You're a genius at figuring out, reverse engineering and patching together any
and all kinds of technology. You can patch in new power sources on the fly, or work out how to jury-rig
devices to perform functions they aren't even designed to, at times."
21,,400CP,upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!!,Red Faction,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","You can make it all better. By studying a piece of technology for a short while, you can come up with
ways to improve its functions or fix design flaws, though you'll still need the related technical skills to
figure out details. In addition, you can use salvaged materials in lieu of fresh parts for this task."
22,,400CP,Xeno-Archaeologist,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Let the tech-priests wring their hands over tech-heresy, you know that all xenos and archaeotech works
on sound physical principles. They worked before, and can be made to work again. You are a master of
figuring out and reverse engineering technology, taking less than a tenth the time it would take a Guild
workshop, and about a millionth the time it would take the AdMech."
23,,600CP,Dead Men Have No Secrets,,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","You've got samples of a civilization's tech, and maybe even pure data recovered from their computers.
But now what? Now, you actually get to use them. You now have the fantastic ability to reverse engineer
unknown technologies, and the more alien they are to you, the better you are at it. The reason why is
because a civilization's technology isn't just one single thing. You can detect the intricacies behind every
little detail, and extrapolate from those details how a civilization thinks, what materials they'd use and
why, and so on. The wider the variety of samples you have, the greater the insights you have into every
level of their civilization. And once you know how they thought, you can make your own versions of
copies of their tech, as if you were a scientist of that civilization. You are not just acquiring raw data, but
understanding what you are discovering.
Capstone boost: With an AI backing you up, you are able to process information much faster. When you
observe a phenomenon, or the effects of a phenomenon, you can correctly infer the cause and/or effects
of what you are observing. See someone get gunned down by a new race that uses weapons that goes
easily through kinetic barriers? Obviously, they're using plasma rounds. Watch an alien robot use beams
to repair a structure? You could write a paper on how, and reprogram it to work on other types of
materials. The more information you have access to, the greater the amount of info you can figure out
on what's going on. Be careful though. Just because you can deduce that those are ferrofluid bombs
being propelled at you, doesn't make you invulnerable to them."
24,,600CP,Development & Improvement,Mass Effect Andromeda,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","When you've got a really rare item on your hands that's made out of materials you need absolutely right
now, the regret of doing so might paralyze you. After all, who knows when you will next be able to get
your hands on one? Well, fear no more! Now when you break something down for resources, you can
make a blueprint for it. So you can build it later, or even make even more of them. And if you don't want
to break it down for resources, you can also be careful to just take it apart into its constituent parts,
learn what every little thing does, and then put it back together. And you now have a blueprint you can
use to make copies. Blueprints for everyoneJumper! Capstone boosted: Having an AI observing
everything you do may be creepy, but at least it's willing to give you tips for improving. Like how to
improve the things you are building. Every time you build something, you can now improve it somehow,
just a little bit. Take a little weight off here, shave that down, and after enough, you might have a whole
new toy in your hands. Any improvements you make will be added on to the blueprint, so you can
further improve it from there. It may not seem like much, but if you build a Mk X gun 100 times, your
improved blueprint might very well qualify for Mk XI status, or maybe even better. You can keep
improving that blueprint as much as you like."
25,,600CP,Garage Spaceship,Ben 10 0.1,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","When you spend a lot of time taking cars apart to sell for scrap and parts, you eventually start getting a
pretty good idea of how they work and which parts are more important than others. So spaceships work
the same way, right? Whether from a hobby or a lifetime of scrapping alien weaponry to sell for some
big bucks, you're good at figuring out advanced tech just by taking it apart and getting a good look at its
insides. You can even maintain, repair, and eventually build things years ahead of the curve using nothing
but common materials you find in 21st Century Earth. When you think about it, a spaceship is just a
really big car, right? You can also hack into things with wires or machinery...though it might take a little
trial and error to get it right, depending on how advanced it is and how smart you are. Sometimes
engineering smarts don't hold up to understanding the super science stuff behind it."
26,,600CP,Sufficiently-Analyzed Magic,World of Tentacles,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Science is mankind’s ultimate weapon against an uncaring universe and the monsters which inhabit it.
Any fool who claims that something cannot be understood or was not meant to be known simply lacks
vision and dedication. You have the capacity to understand and dissect the workings of any phenomenon
that you are able to observe, no matter how alien or esoteric it might be. A magical girl’s transformation
magic could be broken down and reproduced in the form of a henshin device, while an eldritch horror’s
regeneration power could lead you to a cure for cancer, or of cloning the beast and creating loyal
monster spawn based off of it. Naturally your perverse proclivities color the effects of your work: while
you are able to produce “ordinary” technologies with this perk, you will find it a much easier process if
your work contains side-effects or dependencies of a perverse nature. Certainly you can learn how to
harness the power of love as a renewable energy source but if that source requires a magical girl to be
hooked up to a fucking machine and used as a human generator then so much the better!"
27,,600CP,Independent Innovation,Gundam Advanced Generation,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","When it comes down to it, you have to take all the advantages you can get-when you get a chance, you
take it. This will help. By analyzing foreign or enemy technology, you can not only pinpoint the pillars of
'Yes, this is why this works like that', but also find out what they were lacking. You might have to change
a few parts of the original design, but overall you can improve on your foe's failings from data samples
and examples alone. Make your Legilis to the foe's AGE-3."
28,,600CP,Lost Logia Researcher,Anima Beyond Fantasy,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Lost Logia. Artifacts of another age, of the age of Solomon. The Church may claim to disdain them, but
you know the truth. They are powerful. You have begun to reverse engineer them, learning to recreate
the weaker ones, and to create your own derivations. The Wissenschaft would love to have you within its
ranks, and the powers in the shadows shift uncomfortably as you gain more and more knowledge of
ancient artifacts, simply by laying your hand upon them, and hearing the songs within your blood.
Buying this perk grants Ancient Blood free."
29,,600CP,Mass Production,X-Men Evolution,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","A common theme in the world of technological marvels is that they are either left to groups of select
people or only one of them is left in existence. To you however these seem like silly limitations to have
when one has the potential to bring so much peace and prosperity to the world with these amazing
inventions. You happen to have the best ability for the job of ushering in this new age as well.
As long as you look closely at something hard enough and do some basic study it is possible to
completely understand the inner workings of any technology or object down to the tiniest details. While
this works best for technology anything that is an object will do just fine. No object or piece of
technology whether it be slightly ahead of modern times to the cosmic magitech of the future can't be
understood by you.
As mentioned above objects and technology in this sense even has a very loose definition as it can range
from robots, indestructible metal, swords that grant the power of gods, to even the ultimate of
Macguffins. You'll be able to reverse engineer and mass produce practically anything you want from in a
cave with a box of scraps. The objects will always contain their original properties but you can go further
beyond that. You can alter the properties, strengthen them, weaken them, make it so only select people
can wield them, and much more. With enough creativity and effort you may even create superior items
than the original ever was."
30,,600CP,Mind/Machine Interface,Megas XLR,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Machines speak to you, and you speak to them. Touching a created item informs you of how it works,
and what needs to be done to make it work as it should. Doesn't directly help you innovate, but it does
help reverse engineering and repair. If touching the controls, you may bypass them for mental control."
31,,600CP,Paraphysician,Trinity: Aberrant,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Rashoud facilities around the world are ready to take in newly-erupted Novas and teach them how to
use their powers. Training typically involves biofeedback exercises, practical lessons within shielded labs,
and a crash course in quantum physics. After joining Utopia you continued your studies and acquired
several degrees, eventually becoming a licensed Paraphysician. Through observation and testing you can
develop ways to quantify and categorize the mechanics of how individuals access superhuman powers.
While you won't instantly understand the hows and whys behind a power, it's easy for you to create
training methods to ease and speed the development of these powers and design chemicals and
equipment to mitigate any side-effects that those powers may have. As a side note, you've mastered the
skills of Dormancy and Attunement to a degree that most Novas never will and can easily teach these
skills to other Novas."
32,,600CP,Promethean Man,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","It is mankind's destiny to grow beyond this world. The Gods fear this destiny. It's why they've tried to
enslave us, hinder us and even exterminate us. Even the world itself fears our potential. And it is because
of men like you that this is the case. Men who can look at the magic of the world, that thing which
makes a mockery of logic and reason, and force it to bend to our wills. To make the light of the gods into
the light of mankind. So long as you can perceive it, through your senses or through the application of
technological tools, you have the capability to begin to decipher natural and supernatural phenomena
and create new technologies based on that phenomena. Observing the lightning in the sky, the thing
considered only to be controlled by Gods, would allow for the discovery or advancement of electrical
power. Watching and observing as a Magus creates a Bounded Field may open up a field of technology
that allows for the warping and alteration of the fabric of space. Even the strangest supernatural acts,
such as the manipulation of platonic ideals or concepts or abstract ideas, could eventually be something
you make controlled via technology and science. All you need to do is put in the work, have the creativity
and that special bit of genius to make this all work."
33,,600CP,Re-Purposeful Engineering,Crysis,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Ceph technology is capable of creating anything they can imagine, to the point that the Ceph themselves
have lost all interest in their own creations, only ever taking interest in unique proteins produced by
evolution. So how did some dude from Ohio manage to reverse-engineer it in less than a hundred years?
When you're presented with any foreign technology, you can effectively 'trick' the technology into
outright revealing it's operating principles to you instead of going through the extensive process of full
reverse-engineering. On top of being much easier and faster than a slow teardown and re-testing of
stolen equipment, it also means that fully intact artifacts provide massive amounts of completely
accurate information on the operating theory."
34,,600CP,Reverse Engineering Genius,Hive Queen Quest,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","Why take the time to remake the wheel when somebody already did all the work for you? Your grasp of
science and technology is so great that you could rebuild a working blink drive from the parts of a broken
ship, and your dexterity is such that even carefully crafted machines will yield to you when attempting to
take them apart for research. Given time there is probably nothing you couldn't reverse engineer for
your own use, however the more complex the thing you are studying is the longer this will ultimately
take. If something is near or above your current level of technological skill it will be much easier to
understand than something from a thousand years in the future."
35,,600CP,SALVAGE ENGINEERING,Achron,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","The discovery of the Remnant System, filled with alien technology scattered across its planets, fueled a
massive surge in scientific advancement. Entire branches of study were opened with what was found
there, leading first to teleportation devices, and later, to working chronoporter technology. And you have
the kind of skill that made it all possible: not the blind reuse of mysterious artifacts, but careful,
considered study to discover the core ideas and principles behind them, and the adaptation of those
principles to construct new devices to your own ends. Given sufficient time for analysis, no technology is
too exotic for you to unravel its deepest mysteries."
36,,600CP,Science Officer,Generic Space Opera,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse
Engineering","You have vast stores of knowledge regarding technology and are quite adept at grasping the core
principles behind their function, allowing you to formulate hypotheses on new physical principles based
on your observations, though it will require lifetimes of work to perfect them and get to usable results.
You should be able to reverse engineer almost any technology, given the chance and a reasonable
amount of time."
37,,600CP,Scientist Salarian,Reaper Hunter,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse

prefer the clean and sterile world of technology and because of that you have worked out many ways to
recreate strange and often incompatible technology of others to work together in ways that were before
impossible. You could for example study a medicine made of rare mushrooms and herbs and recreate its
effects with a synthetic concoction created in a lab or study the workings of a weapon powered by rare
and exotic elements and create a work around to recreate the same weapon using much more available
materials. The large bowgun that hunter showed you made from sinew and bone that somehow shoots
lasers from ammo created of bugs and rare plants could very well be recreated from steel and synthetic
polymers with enough study and a minor drop in power. This perk allows you to study technology and
recreate it from less esoteric or rare materials at a lower level of power depending on how much study
and work you put into it with more work coming closer to the power of the original piece of technology."
38,,600CP,Secrets of the Ancients,Subnautica,"Domain: Knowledge: Reverse

of it fully capable of designing your own versions with modifications and improvements. Your mind is a
scintillating, brilliant thing moving orders of magnitude faster than anyone else, with a multitasking,
research and invention talent that would make you, as a completely normal person, the biggest threat to

drones strength but also the tools of others. With study you can replicate machinery as biotech, studying
a vibrating blade powered by servos for instance may allow you to recreate it by growing a chitinous
blade powered by micro muscles while studying a ships blink drive may allow you to grow your own out

engineering and arts along with the ability and knowledge to create every technology existed in the
Academy City with the specialization of creating Espers with abilities of your choice or leave it to random
chance. You also gain a preternatural ability to reverse-engineer any technology that you can get your
hands on with enough time but just seeing one in action would give you a rough guess on how it works
and what principles it works on with. The greater the gap of the technology that you know to the one

could have unlocked a greater, deeper and broader understanding of the new technology borne from
studying Azazel in half the time and without the horrific moral cost that White gladly paid, or rather
forced others to pay. You can not only grasp these possibilities and reverse engineer and adapt
extraordinary phenomena you can also interact with such things and various forms of high technology
