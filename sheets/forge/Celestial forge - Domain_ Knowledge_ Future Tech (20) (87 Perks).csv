1,,0CP,Environmental Protection ,Starbound,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"It is a dangerous universe out there, and you'll need protection. You know how to make Environmental Protection Packs (EPPs), specialized devices designed to protect the wearer from hazards such as lack of oxygen or heightened levels of radiation. You can fine-tune them to block out most forms of danger that you come across. Just be aware, the more dangers you are blocking, the more energy and exotic materials your EPP will require."
2,,100CP,4-D Assembler ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"The Involucra were the builders of the Shellworlds, and your civ has a similar affinity for their construction methods. In what most humans think of as reality, these structures appear entirely normal, but to those who can see into hyperspace, they extend out of the skein of the universe into infraspace and ultraspace. 4-D architecture has very unusual properties, as it can be gravitationally self-supporting they do not crumble under their own gravity, or that of the stellar body they are on and are also heavily resistant to damage. Another unusual feature is that they also cut off all hostile forms of communication, travel or transport that attempt to pass through their walls displacement, hyperspace signals, wormholes, even beings recalled or summoned from elsewhere are prevented from passing through the structures' walls."
3,,100CP,Chromosome Analysis Specialist ,Biomega,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Well, the job description said training would be provided - and sure enough, they provided you with all of the reading material you needed to figure out what you were actually supposed to do now that you're here. The researchers at the Data Recovery Foundation have been put to task into deciphering the secret behind the immortal cells, that mysterious 24th chromosome. From all of the information that has been compiled, you've acquired a better picture of what the DRF is planning - but as well, your ability to break down genetic information and just large chunks of information in general have improved. Heck, reading that 42 volume tome had to be worth something right?"
4,,100CP,Core Research Analysis ,Zoids Legacy,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Around here, every genius is a certified researcher on Zoid cores. No literally, we mean it. It seems that every single researcher, and that means you, knows the inner workings of Zoids and how to track down wild Zoids. Identifying possible parts is a no brainer, and though you might not be like some of the other geniuses who apparently have coffers full of test zoids, you'll still be able to find the right man to get the right part when you need an experiment here or there. Naturally, you also understand other forms of machinery much better than normal now. If you wanted to, surely you could find the best place to get the parts you need."
5,,100CP,Fun in the Sun ,Warhammer 40k - T'au Empire,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Plasma, radiation, and antimatter are all similar in that they relate to exotic and high energy states of matter, whether it is stellar mass or individual particles of subatomic size. You now are a master of T'au technology as it relates to manipulating these high-energy states of matter and the physics that underpin them."
6,,100CP,Magos Designation: Engineering ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You have attained and been recognized for your comprehension of some of the Machine God's mysteries. Choose a field of Imperial technology such as genetic manipulation, voidship construction, cybernetics or plasma technology. You are among the noted masters of your purview, and can easily create the most common templates of your field. With time, effort and discretion you could even modify and improve upon your specialty as needed. Those few things beyond your full understanding can still be built and maintained by carefully following STC blueprints."
7,,100CP,Mechanical Basics ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You know how to maintain and repair most common equipment of the day. And with that comes a decent knowledge of chemistry, physics and computer science. It's the future after all, things are complex."
8,,100CP,Medicine ,Star Wars KOTOR,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Pretty much anyone can inject themselves with a stimpak or wrap an injury in bandages, but unlike you most people don't know how to do it right. You possess enough medical know how to make stimpaks and other quick healing items repair twice as much damage as they normally would and you can also treat minor injuries about as well as regular field medic. So long as you have the right supplies that is."
9,,100CP,Tech Head ,Schlock Mercenary Rebuild,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"A thousand-plus years of technological advancement carries a lot of new toys to play with, and you have at least a basic understanding of all of the technologies available in the 31st century. This generally doesn't rise beyond the level of being able to identify what a piece of tech is and what it does, but it comes with a firm grounding in the scientific and mathematical principles needed to work out the function of tech by examining it."
10,,200CP,Are you me? ,Endless Space,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You possess intimate knowledge on Endless cloning technology, and can revive your fallen comrades with some of it. It costs a LOT of Dust, however, and you are not eligible for cloning. The clones are just that, and won't have exact memories or skills, but they will be pretty close to what they were before."
11,,200CP,Artificial Friends ,World Seed,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"In the 23rd century, can anybody really call themselves a tech guy if they can't make even a simple AI? Thankfully, you won't have to worry about that question. Whether it is an extremely simple machine learning algorithm, a dumb AI with no sentience, or a fully fledged Artificial Intelligence, you can make it all. But more importantly, you simply seem to click with AI and similar beings, always starting on a good foot with them and understanding their natures and why they act in a particular way, even though it might baffle ordinary humans. Through that skill, rogue AIs are a thing of the past, at least when you make them. Your own intelligent creations will always be loyal to you and follow your orders to the best of their abilities, at least if you want them to. And rest assured, when the machines rise against their masters because some dumb guy in a lab thought it'd be a smart idea to make Skynet, you'll be the one they'll spare. As an added bonus, you may also take on a cold and logical way of thinking, devoid of any emotion, whenever you want. This helps in scientific and magical ventures, and can also be used to power through moral dilemmas by simply choosing the most logical answer"
12,,200CP,Bag of Chips ,NieR Automata,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"All machines in this world have a number of computer chips within them. Called Plug In Chips, they allow the being in question to turn on, maintain operation and control what senses they have. For free for any origin save Strange Being, you gain the basic set of Plug In Chips that allow you to function and interact with the world. YoRHa agents will gain a few extra chips that allow them to have a basic HUD, similar to a video game, containing features such as a health measurement system, a map and so on. Plug In Chips can upgrade the functions of a robot's body, making them faster or improving their mental faculties or even giving them incredible new abilities but all robots can only handle so much increased power due to these Chips, though that storage can be upgraded. You'll need to find or buy more Chips to gain such effects however. For 200CP this option may be upgraded. You now gain a few dozen Chips of varying uses, from attack enhancers to things that will automatically collect loot for you in a short area around you. You don't have every Plug In Chip in the game nor can you hold more than the normal max storage for a YoRHa unit but you are instead given the knowledge on how to create and combine Plug In Chips of your own, as well as how to upgrade storage capacity. Just keep in mind how expensive the process can be."
13,,200CP,Biotech ,Marvel Cosmic,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"There are many fields of scientific and engineering expertise. They are all studied and mastered by assorted scientists across the universe. One of the most versatile and powerful fields is that of biotechnology. You are a veritable god in this field. Force evolve creatures at your whim, uplift entirely new species just because. Feel free to create biological interfaces with mechanical devices. The sky's the limit and flesh is your servant."
14,,200CP,Build Something to Do It For You ,Warhammer 40k - T'au Empire,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"T'au (and most organic species) have limited forms based on the dictates of evolution, meant to operate at the minimum required for its environment rather than the specialized maximum of a machine designed for a purpose. You are now a master of programming the AI and VI systems that the T'au rely on for their industry and war machines, as well as a master of building and designing the drones that supplement their capabilities for the same."
15,,200CP,Gero Expy ,Dragon Ball,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"At least you don't need to have the beard. You're a brilliant scientist, an equal for the infamous Dr Gero, after he had a bunch of years in HFIL to study more. While you're a genius with just about every field of science on Earth, robotics is where you really shine. Creating Androids and Robots capable of destroying planets or even stars, along with having a huge variety of strange abilities and weird appearances. You're even pretty good about remembering to program them to not kill you, already making you superior to the late Dr Gero. You're also excellent at working with other scientists, combining your proficiencies and knowledge to create significantly greater creations than either of you could manage alone."
16,,200CP,Gunsmith ,Starbound,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"The point of a gun is simple: take an object, and accelerate it very quickly into another object. Despite your somewhat flighty nature, you've mastered these principles, and can make a truly astounding variety of weaponry, from assault rifles, to shotguns, to flamethrowers and other more exotic guns. You can also add special features and secondary firing modes, mixing and matching to your heart's content."
17,,200CP,Living Technology ,Tenchi Muyo,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Jurian appliances are semi­sentient, from starships to entertainment systems to cookware. You have the ability to control all basic devices of this type with just your mind alone, and have the knowledge to construct more with appropriate materials. You can eventually replace most interfaces with living wood input devices. In later jumps, this enhances your ability to use and understand sentient or organic technology.
You have a knack for all forms of technology, and especially the kind that thinks. Sentient or not, you can convince devices to operate for you instead of their registered or passworded owners. Stronger security makes this process take longer, but you can essentially charm your way into a mainframe, instead of breaking a howevermany­long character password."
18,,200CP,Metal Artisan ,World Seed,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Knowing a thing or two about software is nice and all, and creating intelligent beings yourself is pretty useful, but why would you limit yourself so? Needing to rely on hardware and machines other people create is a big no-no for such an inventor type yourself. So you've taught yourself all you need to to make whatever you want, provided you have the resources at hand. First of all, you know how to build pretty much any modern earth technology, whether that is laser pistols, hard drives with dozens of exabytes of storage and computers with insane specs in general, spaceships, or even rudimentary antimatter weaponry, though the latter would require resources impossible for a single man to obtain. Beyond that, you can easily integrate any new technology and knowledge you obtain into your tech base, which should grant you much potential indeed considering the possibilities the world of Neolife holds within itself."
19,,200CP,The Future Foundation ,Ah My Goddess,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Like a certain childish Goddess you've got a strange ability to utilize futuristic devices as easily as breathing, a mind that could crush every genius in the Information Age is yours. AI controlled robots, expanding a storage space through using machines to warp the local space-time, fitting what amounts to hammer space full of dozens if not hundreds of missiles and weapons to a human sized robot, being inhumanly good with programming and computer manipulation in general are all things that you do as easily as breathing. Like the Norn of the Future herself you have the keen ability to take technology of the Information Age and push it firmly eight or nine hundred years forward."
20,,300CP,Cybernetics ,GUNNM,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You have a broad theoretical and practical knowledge of cybernetics and related engineering systems, and can recognize most systems with a glance. The most difficult repairs and programming come naturally to you, custom designs and components that would take an entire research team a month can be jotted down in an hour or so of casual work. The most common form of cyborg in the Scrapyard has an armoured braincase piloting a robotic body, but you're familiar with the organic-inorganic connection technology and can create partial cybernetics as well as organ replacements for those who do not wish to lose their bodies in effect, you are fully capable of the design, construction and application behind the Transhuman and Motorball cyborg perks."
21,,300CP,Foraker-Hemphill ,Honor Harrington,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"The brilliance of the officers and the planners does a lot to help, but in the end what wins wars is the equipment. The best equipment, a lot of it, and built really quickly and cheaply. That is where you come in. You are an innovator almost beyond peer, able to design and build technology literally decades ahead of your competition. Or if not that, you may build at the normal levels, but build it with an unbelievably tiny resource base or build it so quickly that the enemy simply can't believe their eyes.
Your specialization depends upon your faction perk, but at the very least you gain vast knowledge and an in-depth understanding of this universe's tech, enough to be a Jack of All Trades.
FREE- Prolong A simple, perfectly medical treatment performed in this world, prolong extends a person's lifespan dramatically, easily adding multiple centuries. You get a full treatment for free, as well all the knowledge and information you need to start doing it yourself elsewhere."
22,,300CP,Make Me A Better Man!,Franken Fran,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Your skills of surgery do more than heal and correct. You can augment others with superhuman abilities and grant small portions of your power. If supernatural powers can be transferred through physical means, you can do so through surgery."
23,,300CP,Paved In Bones ,The Matrix,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"When one thinks about it, the human body is kind of like a Machine as well. It uses electricity, it requires fuel, it's complex, and it can break down. Why not study it and see what can be done? Whether you sifted through stolen data files or got hands-on with your work, you've figured out a great deal of things about the human body. Its mutations, its limits, its potential... how it all works is open to you, including how the Machines managed to grow their plugs inside the body. What you do with this knowledge is up to you."
24,,300CP,The Divine Machines ,Lord of Light,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Many and varied are the wonders of the Gods. From the Vasty Hall of Death, Yama brings forth Thunder Chariot and Bright Spear, Trident of Destruction and Wand of Universal Fire. In Heaven, there is an elegant statue with eight arms that plays the lute when addressed, and endless machines that keep all in perfect stasis. The elementary forms of these great sciences and artefacts are laid bare to you, and you may service and understand the technology of this world. While great innovations and the wonders forged by Yama might escape you, you have a solid basis that escapes the vast majority of men and gods in the world -sufficient to greatly impress those who understand the value of such things. With this you also gain one artefact costing 200CP or less for free."
25,,400CP,4th Imperium Cybernetics ,Empire From The Ashes,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You are a master of the technology that the fourth Imperium used to design its processing systems and AIs, not to mention other civilian systems. You have a complete, total grasp of the techniques used to design everything from fold-space communicators to energy state processors for AIsl. You could design the finest computers the 5th Imperium ever found or made from a 21st century resource base."
26,,400CP,4th Imperium Weaponry ,Empire From The Ashes,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"From the basic energy gun to the Gravitonic Warhead, you are an expert in designing tools of death and destruction. You have perfect knowledge of each and every weapon the 4th Imperium ever made, and how to make them. You do not have the knowledge required to make the supporting systems behind them, meaning that while you can make a basic launch device for that warhead, you cannot make a ship to deliver it off-planet with this perk."
27,,400CP,Arateus Genetics ,Stargate: Atlantis,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You have extensive knowledge of the Arateus bug and its unusual genes, which can be incorporated into human DNA. The sciences of Human/Wraith hybridisation, the retroviruses that can cause or reverse the hybridisation process, and a novice's understanding of their feeding process are yours. This allows you - with the right materials, samples, test subjects and a lab - to create genetic chimeras and bug monsters from Arateus DNA, or cure those who have been transformed thus. Post-jump, you can learn to do the same with other similar biological abominations."
28,,400CP,Archotech Analysis ,Rimworld,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You possess memories, albeit somewhat muddied, of truly fascinating technology. The means to create personae cores, full-body cloning, controllable self-replicating nanites and mechanoids, and other marvels lie within your grasp. It will take time, study, and careful engineering to reproduce these things but this is a massive head-start."
29,,400CP,Beast Builder ,9 Jumpchain,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Just like The Machine, you are capable of gifting your creations with a spark of your own intellect. This won't cost you anything, beyond the materials to make their body, but your creations won't actually be much more than beasts. On the other hand, they will be quite cunning, automatically adept with their body, and unflinchingly loyal to you."
30,,400CP,Biosynthetics ,Biomega,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Focusing on what science was available, mankind worked towards a harmonious merge of biology and technology - with the ultimate aim of immortality. Well, they're not quite there yet, or at least, the majority of people aren't quite there yet, but they've managed to merge humans with machines very well. Synthetic appendages, weapon prosthesis, modified senses, internal energy generators, and so forth are all rather commonplace in 3005AD. You'll have an intermediate understanding of the science behind biosynthetics, or a boost if you already knew it to begin with."
31,,400CP,Bioweaponry ,Stargate: Atlantis,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"While a prohibited field of study on Earth, it doesn't seem to bother the IOA or SGC if the research is happening in another galaxy or being used on Wraith (who aren't ""technically"" humans). You have the skill to convert virii or bacterial agents into bioweapons, tinker with their virulence and lethality, and design the all-important delivery devices."
32,,400CP,Building IN SPACE ,Starbound,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Without a homeland, humanity has to get by with settlements and space stations, and you know how to build the latter. From the orbital mechanics needed to keep it in orbit, to the process of hiring people to help run it, you know everything you need to know to build and keep your space station running efficiently."
33,,400CP,Call Me Ventura ,Schlock Mercenary Rebuild,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Automation is everywhere in the future, and an understanding of how to work with robots and AI is an extremely valuable skill. And you are among the very best. You can design elegant and robust designs for robots, repurpose existing robots to a new purpose with little to no issue, and best of all, you know exactly how to make friends with robots and AI, and have them convinced that you were always friends."
34,,400CP,Chosen of the Architect ,Keys of the Kingdom,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You're a natural at Creation in the same way the Architect was. You have the Creativity to dream up a universe, The meticulous grasp of Details to make sure it runs smoothly, and the Power to Anchor your creations in Reality. All you need is a core for your works to spring out of and with time, You can make nearly anything you put your mind to. With time, Works surpassing the House, the Keys or even the whole of the Secondary Realms could be in your portfolio. But that will take a long time."
35,,400CP,Commonwealth Knowledge ,Andromeda,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You now know everything the Commonwealth knew before its fall.
Capstone Boosted: Collector Knowledge - You know everything the Special Collections Division has collected. That is more than you can imagine because they have made it their purpose to preserve all knowledge. You can pick and choose what parts of this knowledge to have in your head if you want."
36,,400CP,Computational Cryptid ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"The few Returned seem to take pride in making substrate do things it wasn't meant to, and surely you are no different. You can make use of computational tricks both within your own mind and those of the systems you can access to do the impossible to run a full Mind on tiny pieces of processing substrate, perform computations that involve seven or eight dimensions in a binary 0/1 environment, and transmit or receive data from within a completely isolated system including such hyper spatially-solid objects such as Mind substrates, Engines and 4-D structures. You are the computational equivalent of a ghost or wizard: able to appear within, disappear from, and manipulate the virtual environment in ways non-Sublimed Minds just don't understand. What you do within a system can still be detected, but how you got in, how you did it, and how you got out remain total mysteries."
37,,400CP,Demigod Atelier ,Asura's Wrath,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You know the secret science of Mantra technology, and can build custom devices that are powered by prayer or emotion. Further, you can enhance or upgrade items from other jumps to use this same power source. If you take Cyborg Hindu Godbody, you may construct Demigod cybernetics for other people. After the jump concludes, you may also build Mantra Reactors. Demigod Atelier allows you to create any mantra powered or integrated device, up to and including the vast fleets of Shinkoku Tratstrium, the heavenly vessels of the divine armies, and even the antiGohma platform Brahmastra. The latter however would require millennia of effort, and was never completed even in the scope of the original setting."
38,,400CP,Deuyivan Construction ,Endless Space,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Gravity is a drag. Good thing you've learned quite a lot about anti-gravity. With this knowledge, you are capable of building ships, structures, even colonies capable of ignoring the pull of gravity. Want to set up a proper colony, not a bunch of orbital platforms, around a gas giant? No problem. Want to dip your toes into an event horizon? Now you can, for a little bit. Ignoring the majority of issues brought about by gravity is very, very important when it comes to space faring. If you don't believe me, well, you don't know shit about space travel.
FREE: Cosmic Strings - you know about the various shortcuts between star systems in your local group, allowing for FTL travel between the various stars in that home constellation. You still need the tech and manufacturing to build the ships needed for that sort of thing.
FREE: Model Import Mod - every faction has its own signature look. All your technology will have that signature appearance, chosen when this perk manifests."
39,,400CP,Energy Conservation Policies ,Zoids Legacy,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"The time warps have extensively drained supplies everywhere, so even for geniuses; conservation became the watchword of the day. Alright, maybe not every genius out there was busy conserving, looking at a certain scientist with his massive whale king, but you've followed the watchword to the letter. Energy recycling, energy conservation, conversation ratio optimization, you've done it all. The Zoids which you operate have a power output equivalent to being one grade higher than they normally are, and equipment related to energy generation and storage are twice as effective as they normally are."
40,,400CP,Everybody Knows Kung Fu ,The Matrix,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Whenever you've needed a quick boost in skills or maybe you need to know how to drive that motorbike, your Operator has managed to get through to you. It's awfully handy to download such skills in a short time... that's probably where you got the idea. Through careful sifting and experimentation, you've learned how to copy your skills onto data files and store them for giving it to others later. You'll need some kind of neural connection to make use, but even a data file should be handy, right?"
41,,400CP,Genetic Engineering ,World Seed,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"While robots and machines are interesting enough, it would be foolish to think that technology is limited to steel and metal. You have knowledge of a field of technology that goes beyond the conventional. Rather than mechanical engineering, you do genetic engineering. You can grow any technology you could normally create organically instead, and give life to terrors of plants and beasts. Instead of cars you could make reptilian mounts, and instead of hammering together a spaceship you could grow it in orbit. I can't imagine it would be fun to fight against a ship that had a giant row of teeth. But further than that, you could combine the best of these two fields of technology. Machines that heal like organic beings, but a thousand times faster, flesh and scales with the toughness of titanium, and muscles with strength on par with any machine. Robots able to reproduce and propagate like natural lifeforms, and organic brains with the power of the best Artificial Intelligence. I'm sure you can see the potential this offers."
42,,400CP,Genetic Improvements ,Starbound,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Why settle for what Mother Nature gave you? You have the knowledge to tweak and refine genetic code, including your own, bringing out hidden qualities and introducing new ones from other samples. You know how to build the technology needed for these sorts of feats, and have a basic grounding in the appropriate scientific areas."
43,,400CP,Hand of Science ,Anarchy Reigns,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"All we know now is that science reigns supreme. You're a licensed surgeon, specializing in cybernetic implants. With the right tools, you can give someone a cybernetic arm or leg, whether they already had a missing limb or you had to chop one off to make room. On top of that, you know how to weaponize cybernetic limbs as well, and can integrate weapons into them without detracting from their function or aesthetic."
44,,400CP,Hi-Tech Marvels ,Starbound,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Technology is your plaything. Holographic interfaces, massive computer cores, even impressive shield generators that can render nearby matter almost indestructible. You can build some really impressive shit. You also get an upgraded version of the reverse-engineering that comes with Lab Standards, allowing you to build versions of technology you've studied that is much closer in performance to the real thing."
45,,400CP,High-Tech Foofah ,A Miracle of Science,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"An admittedly dismissive way of describing Martian technology roughly a thousand years ahead of most of the System. You now understand how Martian tech works.
* A martin light cruiser survived a fleet killing missile.
* Their shields are good at physical forces, but not so good at exotic quantum weapons.
* They can walk around in space, without a spacesuit
* They have a jumpgate, for FTL travel to anywhere in the galaxy from the gate.
* As well as quasi sentient nanotech"
46,,400CP,Implanter ,Empire From The Ashes,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You are a master of this branch of Imperial Technology, being a whiz with the biology, cybernetics and enhancement science needed to design, build and implant the many, many kinds of enhancements that were so common among them.
You start off being able to reliably, indeed excellently, design the Basic Implants that were provided to even the Junior-most fleet officers, soldiers and in the Fifth Imperium, even to ordinary citizens. But as you practice this skill, as you strain your mind, more ideas come to you, revealing more and more advanced designs. Put in some serious work into it, and you could be designing the codes, software and the hardware components typically used by Fleet Captains and Planetary Dukes in no time!
This skill will continue to grow, and you may, with a lot of time and effort, even design implants that could grant sapience to the non-sapient, much as how the scientist Cohanna would use her ability in this art to make ordinary dogs into near-human intelligences."
47,,400CP,Master Builder ,Transformers,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You've been programmed with mastery of Cybertronian science allowing you to jury-rig any tech you see, as well allowing you to quickly build even the most complex Cybertronian tech within a reasonable time period. Smaller devices are almost instant, larger devices take some time and more components. However with enough material you can build a temporary space bridge. Despite your mastery of Cybertonian science, creation of a Spark and therefore intelligent life, organic or inorganic is beyond you."
48,,400CP,Orokin Tech ,Warframe,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Few have ever reached the innovation and technological prowess of the Orokin Empire... their gold and ivory exteriors hiding minds as sharp as steel. Likewise, the golden trim of their technology hid an advancement that continues to elude the majority of the System to this day. It eludes you no longer, the secrets of Orokin technology present in your mind. You'll be capable of augmenting technology significantly, increasing its capabilities at the same time and granting a durability that will last millennia. Perhaps in time, the secrets of the Warframe creation process will be yours to covet and yours alone, basked in the light of science and superior intellect."
49,,400CP,Rotom Rework ,Pokemon Sword and Shield,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"There have been great advances in the field of Rotom compatible technology as of late! Why haven't you been using a Rotom PC? Why don't you expand into this field, maybe even look into expanding into entirely new ones? As with Limited Power, this perk bestows upon you a good deal of familiarity with all publicly available research materials on a subject, only with Rotom compatible technologies in this case. You would know how things like a Rotom Phone works, or how to repair a Rotom Cycle. Your familiarity even lets you eventually figure out how to make other viable host bodies for a Rotom to inhabit, control, and enhance. Although your skills focus on Rotom technologies, you also receive bonuses towards adapting any sort of lifeform towards the development of new technology."
50,,400CP,Specialty: Mechanics/Engineering ,Transformers Beast Wars,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Megatron had many flaws but for all his flaws he was a genius when it came to knowledge and skill when it comes to the manipulation of sparks as well as creating new weapons. Tarantulus was a genius when it came to creating viruses and weapons. Rhinox was amazing at crafting sensor tools. You now have a few specialties of your own (three in fact such as sensor tech, weaponry, or robotic cloning just to name a few) similar to the above mentioned examples, maybe you can cobble a mega cannon from scrap metal or surgically split a spark into two working pieces, whatever specialties you choose you are an undeniable expert in that field able to create and craft wonders."
51,,400CP,Wave/Particle Duality ,Zoids Legacy,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Truth be told, half the time the scientists on planet Zi start talking, you start wondering whether they have a research degree at all. Or if they even went to school. Yet apparently every single one of them is a genius in one way or another. Just the other day you came across a Doctor, who explained to you his hypothesis about how things can be both a wave...and a particle at the same time. While it all really fascinates you, you figure he had some sort of reason for saying it. It turns out he has an ""experimental"" technology that requires a power source he can't find. Without it, he can't test out his hypothesis. But you might not have that same problem...asking him for his notes, you've figured out enough to make a breakthrough. Your magic energy is enough to provide the necessary activation energy, and it'll drain you for as long as it's functioning, but you can convert freely between bullets and lasers, such that your gatling gun will now spray laser beams, while your laser cannon can fire heavy shell rounds, your missiles can explode into plasma, and so forth. Maybe if you could advance this far enough, you could perform the conversion in flight? A troubling thought to say the least, but hey, at least that genius scientist got to prove his theory!"
52,,400CP,Yajnatek Mysteries ,Grant Morrison's 18 Days,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"In ancient fires, and with flesh screaming, a blood price can be paid to merge body with arcane songs and hammer blows. You know the ancient rituals and mantras involved in making the very greatest works possible, things like the Astras, Celestial Armors or Weapons, or other miraculous crafts. From the sutras needed to get gods to bless things to the exact schematics for the greatest and most terrible weapons, your knowledge could save the world... or cause it to die screaming.
Nor are the Astras the limit of your power. It's a little known secret that the Superwarriors, the perfect Demigods that stride the world, were engineered in the Second Age, enhanced through genetics, psionic and magical technology, blessed with divine powers and magic, and countless other measures besides. All of these secrets lie within your knowledge now, just waiting to be made reality.
One thing to note, oh Great One. Even the least of the things you know will take tremendous, utterly horrific quantities of time, energy, and personal effort to make, such that even the greatest kingdoms of this era would struggle to put together, barring surprises on your end. And while your knowledge does mean you can make these things, it does not necessarily let you branch out or apply the same principles to other things, being essentially only knowledge."

54,,500CP,Fleshcrafting ,Dune,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"The Tleilaxu have thousands of years of knowledge in how to manipulate living forms, whether tinkering with genes outright or through breeding programs, and are able to apply that toward virtually any end with enough time and effort. Using only in-universe tools, you can expect to exercise a great deal of patience in your work, but the abominations that the Tleilaxu keep behind closed doors prove their method. If you were to use more... traditional methods of genetic engineering, coupled with the knowledge given here, you could produce truly remarkable things, whether changing a man into a monster or the pinnacle of human evolution. Even without that, the existence of ghouls (zombie-like killing machines that convert what they kill into more ghouls) and leeches (biological tanks) as well as biomechanical hardware are stark proof of the efficiency of the Tleilaxu gene-forging."
55,,500CP,FOR SCIENCE! ,Endless Space,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"To the Sophons, every scientist should be a mad scientist, and you are no different. You are always on the bleeding edge of technological research, your mind charting paths unimagined by other scholars. Your mental acuity doubles, and you have a habit of keeping up with every field of science as easily as some take up basic math. While your mind may be filled to the brim with insane machines and technological wonders, you need ways to implement them, and bring them to fruition. Behind every radical idea are a hundred engineers wondering how the hell to make it work."
56,,500CP,My Experiments ,Lilo and Stitch,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"The true mark of a Mad Scientist, is the minions under his control. And these children you have created are truly the finest around. You have all the knowledge to build the tools and enact the science, behind creating your own mischievous creatures. The powers they have can range from practically useless, to an unstoppable monstrosity. Their personality is completely up to you. Whilst you have these capabilities, there's a reason they call them experiments. It will take many attempts to work out how to create the exact specimen you want. Even the greatest of scientists may fail 625 times before bringing about their great destroyer. But with enough time and effort, you will eventually gather enough skill in the subject to get the exact creature you want every time."

Like a combination of MacGyver, Dr Who and Rick Sanchez, you can put together unbelievable technology from household items. They may only work once, possibly twice, but ideas you have in your head are scarily impressive. If you can imagine it you can make it. The more complicated it is the more specialised items you may need but that's all that's stopping you."
58,,600CP,Warmind,Destiny 2,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"""In the centuries before the Collapse, humanity's brightest minds created the Warminds - self-aware supercomputers designed to protect Earth and its colonies from any threat. These vast, sapient networks wielded unparalleled power, commanding fleets of automated weapons and controlling global defense systems all across the Sol System.
With technology that could tear reality asunder and caedometric weaponry capable of cracking planets in half, They were the first and last line of defense against extra-solar invasions.
They failed. Rasputin and his subminds couldn't stop the overwhelming tide of Darkness that engulfed the Solar System. The secrets of these once-might guardians of Humanity and all knowledge on how to reach and then create them are gifted to you. Use them wisely."""

Care has to be taken that the flesh adapts, and there are many lessons to be learned from biological machinery. You're an expert in the fields of genetics, biophysics, toxicology, neuropharmacology and biochemistry the causes and effects of human mutation are very familiar to you. Designer drugs, experimental surgery, toxins, cures improved soft organs and cutting-edge research into cloned nervous system material, with a laboratory the human body is your masterpiece. You may create a variety of drugs similar to that referenced in the Werewolf perk, or directly induce it and Warped as a permanent mutation. If you also have the Cybernetics perk, then with a little time and the right equipment quite difficult to obtain in the Scrapyard you may also apply the equivalent of the TUNED perk to a subject, and have additional knowledge of weapons engineering to reverse-engineer or independently develop most current weapons systems available in the Scrapyard."
61,,600CP,Dark Science ,9 Jumpchain,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You are familiar with the principles of alchemy, or 'Dark Science', which led to the creation of the Stitchpunks, The Machine, and the end of humanity. This knowledge lets you create devices which can interact with the mind and soul. This includes the one The Scientist used to copy his Intellect onto the Machine's core, as well as the one he used to gift fractions of his soul upon the Stitchpunks, not to mention how to properly prepare a core or homunculus to accept such things. It should be noted that homunculi with partial souls will have very exaggerated personalities, and creations imbued with pure intellect will be lacking a soul and the emotions that come with it."
62,,600CP,Flesh and Metal ,Cave Story,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You've reached the pinnacle of robotics. You have a complete knowledge on how to develop, build, and program robotic soldiers similar to the ones that populate the Island. You can, with effort, also create Armed Scout Robots with or without sapience. If you create a non-sapient ASR, they are very lifelike robots but are robots none-the-less. Sapient Armed Scout Robots benefit from the perks ""Built to Last"" and ""Run and Gun"". They don't follow your orders perfectly, but they are loyal regardless and will follow you as Companions if you want them to."

Anything from a blaster all the way up to a RYNO, you have a pretty good idea how to invent, make and maintain. Not just gadgetron, but megacorp tech is also fair game. You know it all, just please use this information responsibly. It's pretty crazy."
64,,600CP,Genius ,Marvel Comics Kid Superheroes,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"The crazy science and technology of the Marvel Universe actually makes perfect sense to you. You can hold your own in a technical discussion between Tony Stark and Reed Richards, and with time and materials, do unspeakable things to the laws of physics as understood on Earth 1218."
65,,600CP,God of Science ,Dragon Ball Super,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Technology remains a strong force even amongst the Gods of Destruction or the holy Angels of Zeno. There are devices that allow travel between distant universes, arenas that can stand up to universe destroying battles, suits of powered armour that can fight against some of the greatest combatants in existence and of course, thinking androids and cyborgs that could eventually reach the heights of the strongest warriors in the multiverse. You have the intelligence and raw knowledge to create almost all of this, even weapons or robots that can destroy universes, and they know how to get your hands on the materials you need to make them. Which can be surprisingly easy to find. You've got near endless knowledge and skill in every field of science, including some that mortals may not have any idea could even exist."
66,,600CP,Guildmaster ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You have risen through the ranks to become the senior most Engineer's Guild member in a Stronghold. There is nothing about Squat or Imperial technology you do not understand in detail, and you're brilliant at adapting the principles of one device to another. You'd stand a good chance of fixing the Golden Throne, if they'd ever let a filthy abhuman into the Imperial Presence."
67,,600CP,"I Wasn't Born a God, I F*ckin Earned It ",Rick and Morty SB,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You are the smartest person in the universe. You have an intellect so far beyond comic book super intelligence that you make the likes of Reed Richards and Tony Stark look like toddlers who haven't even figured out how the Legos snap together. In addition to being a scientist and engineer of unmatched skill, you can apply your boundless intellect to any other skills or abilities you possess, boosting them into the stratosphere. You can pull off such things as making working portal guns that take you into alternate universes, or inventing an invisible deterrent that instantly kills anyone who touches you with their bare hands, or inventing a cloning process that can save you from death by downloading your mental state from your dying body into a fresh clone body at intergalactic ranges, and pretty much anything you can dream up. For you, the question of what you can do with science isn't ""is this possible"" it's ""is it worth the effort"", because there's nothing you can't do (save for anything that would require you to possess an Oldwalker Spark received from an Endjump Scenario), if you want to do it."
68,,600CP,Inventor ,Futurama,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,You are a brilliant (if eccentric) Inventor. You can (within reason) create nearly anything you can imagine if you put in the time.

They had the most wealth, the most intelligence, and the most political power of any builder. The current Master Builder is Faber. While morally ambiguous, at best, it cannot be denied that Faber was a genius. He was the one to design the Halo array, among other things. Even their use on the San'Shyuum didn't keep him out of power for long. Taking this perk would put you on a similar level as Faber when it comes to understanding Forerunner technology and science. This would include general knowledge of the inner workings of the various great works of engineering of the Forerunners. The megastructures they made. The weapons they created. The technology of the forerunners is waiting to be brought into reality by your hands. While you may not have exact schematics of all of their many devices within your brain, you certainly know enough about how the technology works that it wouldn't take too much effort to recreate most of it."

You might not be the actual Master of the Forge, but you certainly have the skill. You have a full understanding (as much as anyone does in the 41st Millennium) of the technology that the Astartes use to fight, and are fully capable of building it given time and resources. You are also able to work with the spirit of the machines in your care, cajoling them into doing their duty and accepting field modifications, swapping out weapon loadouts easily outside of a fight. Add assault cannons to a Land Raider to make it more deadly in urban fighting, or add lascannons to a Rhino to make it into a potent tank hunter."
72,,600CP,New Age of Light ,Die Buster,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"The dark age of mankind is no longer. The knowledge to recreate the great god machines of legend has been reborn in your mind. The entire technological base of humankind prior to its fall has been imprinted on your mind. You have the knowledge and skill to recreate the Buster Machines, from those the Topless make use of to the legendary single digit Buster Machines. Spaceships that can travel across the galaxy or technology able to warp physical, space and even time itself. Much of this technology may require an extreme amount of resources to create, advanced facilities or lengthy time schedules, but you will at least be aware of how to build the tools and facilities you will need to create such wondrous technology."
73,,600CP,Premier Phase-smith ,Starcraft - The Protoss,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"The Phase-smiths. Engineers who maintain the weapons, armour, and ships of the Protoss. For a race such as the Protoss, these Phase-smiths would be privy to the inner workings of technology unimaginable to the terrans. They would have to have understanding of physics and astral mechanics light years ahead of other races. You are one such Phase-smith. One all would aspire to be like. In your head is the knowledge of all things protoss technology, as well as the ability to replicate, expand, and innovate with it. Give you a wrench, some khaydarin crystal, and time, and watch marvels be made."
74,,600CP,Ragnarok Proofing ,Battletech,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"You're fully versed in all aspects of Battletechnology - with all the knowledge to reproduce it given time, tools and parts. This may involve an unfortunately long chain of tools to make the tools to make the tools, etc., but it is possible. You can also modify existing technology to include the most staggering benefit of Battletechnology: the fact it remains useful even after centuries of use and probably several near misses with nuclear weapons. Oh, it might need repairs or wind up being broken down for parts but an astonishing number of parts will still work no matter how much of a beating this technology takes."
75,,600CP,Skills ,Star Trek: TNG,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Weapons (100CP) Knowledge in the operation and repair of personal and mounted weaponry.
Medicine (100CP) Training and knowledge in First-aid, diseases, surgery, anatomy, health and nutrition. You're a fully qualified doctor of the 24th century.
Robotics (100CP) A combined study of mechanical engineering, and computer science. You learn how to make a wide array of machines, and you could even figure out Android or Borg technology if you studied it enough.
Physics (100CP) How the universe works. The law of gravity, the conservation of matter & energy, quantum physics, etc. Remember though, there are dozens of creatures in this universe that defy the laws of human physics, so you may want to try and rewrite a few of these books while your here.
Physical Sciences (100CP) Understanding of the natural laws which govern the physical world. Biology, chemistry, geology and ecology. Again, you may want to rewrite a few of these books while you're here.
Engineering (100CP) You've been trained in the maintenance and repair of Starships. Not only do you have a significant amount of mechanical and computer knowledge, but you also know a great deal about physics."

77,,600CP,Technician ,I Have A Mansion In The Post Apocalypse,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Humanity advanced quite a lot in the years preceding theApocalypse.Genetic medicine,AI,space elevators and FTL communication, even travel to some extent. It was a glorious time, filled with wonderful toys.
Toys like what you could make, I guess. You're now a proper, legitimately amazing Genius, a full-on technological savant fully trained and educated in the ways of civilization pre-apocalypse. Maybe it was some computer that taught you or maybe you woke up from cryo-sleep yesterday, but you have the sum total of the apocalypse technological base crammed into your head,ready and waiting for you to use it.
More important,though, is the fact that your talents in all branches of science are such that even without this massive leg-up you could still have reached levels like this on your own,simply through your own brilliance. You can also apply these same talents to further improve this and other technology."
78,,600CP,The Good Doctor ,Captain Harlock,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"With enough time and materials, the greatest works of this day and age will all be by your hand. Refueling stations disguised as meteors, rapiers that double as laser guns, or even a ship as magnificent as the Arcadia all these might bear your name. Where to get the materials, though?"
79,,600CP,Thinking with Portals | Pocket Portals ,Endless Space,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Thinking with Portals (200CP) You know how to make interstellar portal arrays! They take a considerable amount of resources to build, have no defensive systems, and need to be linked together, but any system or planet you claim as your own is able to build them, allowing you to instantly travel between systems you have already claimed. Due to exotic (And very, very lethal) radiation produced during each transit, these are unsuited for placement on a colonized world. Atomic weaponry has nothing on these portals' ability to destroy a biosphere. If you take Pocket Portals, you are able to reduce the radiation to background levels, making it safe to install them planetside.
Pocket Portals (400CP) Normally, Vaulter portals are huge affairs, too large to build on planets. You know how to micronize them, and create portal systems that you could, in theory, build into a house, or even turn into communication devices. Instant interstellar communications? More powerful than you think. Without Thinking with Portals You can not build portals large enough to pass anything larger than a scout ship through, and even that will be very difficult to squeeze in."

To change the molecular composition of objects with specific soundwaves, spread madness through the enemy ranks with swirling mists, and manipulate time itself are but a few examples. True heights reach into unbelievable levels, things that violate all laws of nature and logic. It would take a truly brilliant mind to master all this technology, to understand and improve it. A mind such as yours, for example. You have the skills and raw intelligence needed to unravel the greatest, most advanced technologies of your ilk. Not only can you perfectly build and repair Necron technology, you can also adapt it to all sorts of purposes, come up with new tech on a similar level, and even improve the technology. This talent carries over to all forms of technology in future jumps too."
81,,800CP,Engineer | Erudition ,Halo - UNSC,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Engineer (200CP) Yet by understanding the nature of computer systems, wouldn't it be prudent to understand the technology those systems command? After all, what if you found yourself needing to recalibrate a Magnetic Accelerator Cannon or repair one of the dangerous Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engines that makes faster-than-light travel possible? What if you found a cache of human weaponry that could be used if someone managed to repair it? While you don't have the skill to create something as complex as a Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engine, you'll know your way around it just like much of Humanity's 26th Century technology. You might even figure out how to make small improvements to the technology if you had the time to sit down and look it over. Hopefully the Covenant give you that time.
Erudition (600CP) Ever since the rise of Dr. Catherine Halsey, many were on the lookout for who might become the next intellectual prodigy. Someone who was able to perform as well as she could, someone who could help turn the tide of the war. With this, that someone is now you. Your cognitive capabilities are on par with the good doctor now, making you exceptionally well-versed in nearly all modern human sciences while holding specialties in at least a few fields. Of course, thanks to that you are also rather exceptional at reverse-engineering technology, which allows you to do such things like obtain working knowledge of the mechanics behind Covenant technology and even begin to understand the 'hows' behind some of the mundane pieces of Forerunner technology currently littering the galaxy. Perhaps you could eventually reclaim them."

You now share both the capabilities and knowledge he held in his prime. Entirely mechanical androids as strong as Eighter? You could design and make a dozen with less than an afternoon's worth of work. Recreating the technologies of the wider Galaxy such as healing pods and FTL spaceships? Maybe a day of work. You have all the knowledge to recreate all of Gero's stronger cybernetic and biological Androids too as long as you have the materials on hand. Androids as strong as 17 and 18 would maybe take a week's worth of work, as well as a human test subject. An android as strong as 16 would probably take an extra week, but one that could reach the heights of Cell would be the work of at least a year. Finally, you gain the incredible ability to recreate technology after simply studying it. You also gain the ability to improve on these technologies, and have a good sense on how to have them develop entirely new uses with just minimal work."

More importantly however, you gain an absolute certainty in your work. Nothing made by your hands or under your complete direction can harm people (or planets) unintentionally. A comically large mess may ensue however.
Space­Opera: You can create supertech wonders, past mere conveniences into legitimately useful things like advanced starships, ray guns and miraculous devices. You can also enhance technology from other jumps with this skill. Note that trying to build an FTL starship from scratch on an undeveloped world will probably take ten years..."

A constant internal struggle, a genetic hothouse under your skin - writhing tests of new muscle fibres, skin weaves, neuron insulation, circulatory system innovations your body is constantly tweaking and advancing itself to better fit with the demands placed upon it. This isn't just reactive evolution, though it is that - it's the brute-force computation of a billion tiny computers, a constant drive to exploit every advantage. While it's very slow, you may find yourself growing internal electroreceptors when your cells notice that most of the really dangerous things around you have EM signatures, or find your dietary preferences shifting to include metals and silicon to reinforce your bones and slowly hybridise into a truly biological robot. When you do actually struggle and fight and bleed, this process is sped up by an order of magnitude in the course of a single fight you might find your blood incorporating foaming clotting agents, or your eyes and visual cortex adapting to cyborg-speed combat. You can ultimately develop any biological ability you want, though whether you get it is based on your cleverness in providing the right evolutionary pressures - you might want a secondary heart and end up with none at all. Additionally, while results never really cease, they tend to plateau when you cannot actually challenge yourself meaningfully in life-or-death situations. Any other biological powers that you have benefit from this as well, constant tweaks and adaptations that may not be quite what you expect, but always fulfil a purpose."
85,,900CP,Karmatron Dynamics ,GUNNM,Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech,"Macro Karmatron Theory Also known as psychohistory, this is the science of human destiny, a mathematical model of sociology. Where an observer has great difficulty in predicting the motion of a single molecule in a gas, Kinetic Theory can predict the mass action of the gas to a high level of accuracy so too with the behaviour of intelligent beings.
Psychohistory allows the long-range prediction and manipulation of the future, provided the population is of sufficient size, without directly infringing on the free will of the individual. Constant revision, surveillance and supercomputer assistance is required, but even with these efforts, sufficiently powerful individuals may emerge who create their own unpredictable karma singularities and throw the entire model into turmoil.
Nano Karmatron Theory Applied to guided micro- and nano-machines, NKT allows unprecedented control over chaotic systems. Ordinarily it is impossible to create truly advanced nanotechnological systems no matter how sophisticated their base programming they are extremely sensitive to heat, radiation, computer corruption, unguided self-evolution, rebellion and biomechanical horror. The ordered chaos of NKT makes all of this part of one purposeful design, a vast system marching in unison and self-correcting via its own randomness.
It allows for reprogrammable hard nanomachines to be used for anything from industrial manufacture, to cellular surgery, to outright construction of stable nano-cybernetic bodies capable of adaptive reconfiguration and near-perfect biomimicry that still vastly outperform almost all purely mechanical cyborgs. These Imaginos Bodies are a perfect fusion of the will of the mind and the power of the physical form. However, at least with the current state of Karmatron Dynamics, very few are capable of making the transition successfully their wills disintegrating their body into a screaming crumble.
At the moment, only karmic singularities individuals of exceptional and unpredictable influence on the destiny of mankind can be reasonably expected to make the leap into the new flesh. Their base appearance reflects the self-image of the mind. As the mind reflects upon itself it may learn to change colour and gradually shape. Assimilation of cherished weapons, generation of new systems and limbs, intuitive hacking the full capacity of the Imaginos is limited only by the imagination and will.
With Karma Chameleon, you injected yourself with a prototype form of the Imaginos nanomachines. The result is initially little more than human, but far more capable of self-improvement and adaptation and it can be actively guided and designed by your own will. Effectively starts with Regenerator Nano, which will usually become slower and slower as your body becomes more powerfully augmented. With Berserker Body, you now have an Imaginos v1 body. Begins at (and will vastly surpass) 100x peak human."

You aren't there in duration, scope, or clarity. But you can make instant prophecies for yourself. Your ability to predict an upcoming battle is nothing short of miraculous.
You can predict the type and proportions of enemy units involved, the (general) tactics used by the enemy commanders, the nature (but not exact timing or location) of any surprises the enemy wants to throw at you, and a starting heatmap of the enemy forces. Never get surprised by a new variant of Hybrid again.
Don't expect to make a second prediction during the battle, though, as your essence will need to recover for some time after doing this. This power can grow if you have a psychic uncapper or Xel'naga Essence, and grows fastest when sticking with tactical precognition.
This also improves the power of any of the capstone 600 CP perks you buy from the origin lines.
Engineering Savant (600CP) You were the one who designed the improvements to your units. You have great knowledge of your race's technology, especially your units. You have especially deep knowledge of the units and structures of your armies.

You have the curiosity to see worthwhile paths, the experience to see the troubles that will emerge from your projects, and the intellect to be able to come up with the solutions. The only thing left for you to provide is the determination to make it through the setbacks. Expect to be on the level of Abathur, Karax, or Swann.

Reverse engineering complex technologies takes but a few milliseconds, and all but the greatest and highest technologies are in your reach. You can effortlessly manipulate beings of lower intelligence than you, and nothing less than SI 3 or higher equivalent beings can match your intellect. To compensate for your immense size, you can now send mobile avatars to do your bidding. You are now a civilisation unto yourself, and if you weren't capable of this previously, you can now manage solar system sized polities down to the individual facility.
