1,,100CP,Acquester ,Spiral Knights,Domain: Quality: Resources,"In times of crisis and desperation, resources become too precious to use on anything other than necessities. The spiral Order has had to save all their supplies to repair their ship, so you've had to make do on the field. you know how to look for your own resources, remaining self-sufficient in the field through using scavenged items as supplies for anything ranging from simple maintenance to complex construction. Power Cores, Blighted Bones, or even Goo Drops can be used as spare parts or more. With what you've learnt, these days you don't just survive, you thrive. Whether it's machines that power the Constructs or the way that Wolver's fur burns, you've learned to figure out what separates useful resources from useless refuse. The world keeps spinning, knight. Keep up or die."
2,,100CP,Backyard Handywork ,Phineas and Ferb,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Who needs a massive machine shop or specially-crafted equipment when you have some plywood and a toolbox? No matter how complex or intricate of a project you might be making, you'll find that you can easily figure out how to substitute commonly available tools and resources for more complex equipment, and still have the final project come out fine. Also comes with a decent understanding of engineering, architecture, and a few other material science fields to help you get started on whatever projects you might want to work on."
3,,100CP,Coconut Tech ,Bloons,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You are extremely intelligent, with such a great understanding of technology that you can supplement inferior parts for better parts as needed. The worse the substituted part is, the shorter it will last, but it will function perfectly while the part is inserted. Using vines, wood, and coconuts to replace wires, sheet metal, and batteries is not out of the question. With each building skill gained, you gain the ability to insta-craft a crude version of that building out of thin air.
* Fort Raiser - Bark Barricade. A fortified wooden wall, twenty feet wide by six feet tall, with wood spikes along the top. Will last for eight hours before breaking down, if not attacked."
4,,100CP,Composition Analysis ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain: Quality: Resources,"""Before you get to work, you need to know what it is you're dealing with!"" -that was the first lesson you were taught when you started this discipline. Certainly, your mentor was right. Without knowing what you're working with, you're simply courting with catastrophe. With a bit of help from the Aether tools you have, you can discern the properties of any material you're working with -enough to know if there's an occupational hazard involved with handling them. But with sufficient practice and a discerning eye, you can figure out what any item is made up of."
5,,100CP,Difference Engine ,Smash Up,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You can build a computer with anything, at virtually any tech level. Even water channels or a mob with two colored flags apiece."
6,,100CP,Element Analysis ,Bomberman 64: The Second Attack,Domain: Quality: Resources,"With a little elbow grease, you can easily identify the elemental composition of ANY material and with the right resources, break it down to its base elements for further use."
7,,100CP,"In A [Underwater] Cave, With A Box of [Titanium Wreckage]",Subnautica,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Most people would say that doing science underwater is a bad idea, but not you. Whatever experiments you run in the future will be easily waterproofed, so if your habitat loses integrity you won't lose months of work. You also gain a basic education in this centuries' school system, which is a lot better than it sounds if you consider the tech level."
8,,100CP,Junker ,Generic Wretched Hive,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You're good at keeping things running even with shoddy tools and improvised replacement parts. The end result will always work. Not very well or for very long, but it will work. If you can get a hold of decent materials and tools you can do much better, even cobbling together devices almost as good as those that were made or repaired in a proper shop."
9,,100CP,Magic Rocks ,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You may be familiar with gemstones as simply being shiny rocks. Here that is not the case, all gems in this jump have magical powers, and while they do not individually possess much power, they can give significant boosts when collected by the hundreds or thousands. By paying 100 CP, you can choose to take this quirk with you, changing gemstones in future worlds to possess small magical powers of their own."
10,,100CP,Plowshares from Swords from Plowshares ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You might have noticed most of the best Squat vehicles and weapons are repurposed mining and industrial equipment. This is no accident, for not only do such things have to be tough, they are intimately familiar to operators and engineers alike. You have a particular genius for weaponizing civilian technology, and finding constructive industrial uses for weapons."
11,,100CP,Rationing ,Mad Max,Domain: Quality: Resources,"When you don't have much, it's important to be careful with what you've got. You're very good at saving supplies, ensuring that anything you find of use stays found and that it doesn't get wasted by accident. You'll get every last drop of fuel from a can, and never drop some plastic tubing just because you can't think of a use at the moment."
12,,100CP,Repair Savvy | Fancy Suit ,Outlaw Star,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Repair Savvy (100CP) Your skills in mechanics are top notch. Your weapons, armor, and personal equipment are all easy to repair, and maintenance of all of them takes mere minutes instead of hours.
Fancy Suit (0CP) A colorful set of clothing, highly individualized and tailored to fit perfectly. The fabric also breathes well, and can be stylized towards the practical or the ostentatious."
13,,100CP,Resource Management ,Empire from the Ashes,Domain: Quality: Resources,"What can I say? You're an expert at logistics. You know how to extract the maximum possible use out of even the absolute least resources. A ragtag group of counter-mutineers managed to not only survive, but actually attack and make inroads into damaging an almost unimaginably better armed, equipped and numerous group. Just like them, you too can make virtually endless repairs, adapt low level-tech to interface with higher level tech, and in general stretch the usage of those resources far beyond what even the shrewdest economist could ever manage. Mind you, this is for people and tech most of all. While it will work on other resources, even magical, esoteric ones like mana and whatnot, don't expect remotely the same efficiency for them."
14,,100CP,Risk of Disassembly ,Mousehunt,Domain: Quality: Resources,"When creating a trap with a hunter in mind, one must consider how often the hunter moves from region to region and also the wide variety of mice capable of utterly demolishing the trap. Since designing a trap to be unbreakable is likely to make it unwieldy, an alternative approach is to engineer it to fail. This philosophy applied to your crafting endeavours allows you to make things which are designed to safely break apart regardless of the circumstance sure, you'll have to reassemble it after it breaks, but the risk of it utterly disintegrating under the force of a dragon mouse's fire is removed."
15,,100CP,Ritualistic ,Azeroth,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You are much more skilled at elaborate rituals. You often find that if a ritual calls for the blood of 10 virgins, you can get away with just 5. This only applies to magic such as Enchanting or Inscription, not to anything scientific in nature. So you'll still need those two batteries for your rock'em sock'em robots."
16,,100CP,Scavenger ,Ravenwood,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Sometimes, you do not have the luxury of top of the line equipment and need to rely on what scraps you can salvage. You, however, have an advantage, being able to cobble together scavenged bits into functional equipment that work as well as the real deal. This talent will also inherently improve the durability of such improvised equipment to function even when such materials should not feasible hold up under the strains of use.
"
17,,100CP,Scrap Hound ,Dead Space,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You build. Of course, you need parts to build, and, of course, you need materials, usually scrap metal or leftover electronic bits and bobs, to make parts. Whenever you go looking for scrap parts to use as materials, you always find more than you would otherwise, five instead of four, twenty-five instead of twenty, whatever. When you build parts from materials or scrap, you always find you need less materials, on the same order as that bonus, to put those parts together. Really, really useful if you plan to build electronically-based weapons, armor, etc, or extensively modify your own, pre-existing, equipment through similar means."
18,,100CP,Six Dollar Man ,Sesame Street,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Whenever you are trying to create some sort of machine, whether a robot or a car, pick a specific amount of money.  You can then find all of the necessary materials you need to make that item for exactly that specific amount of money.  You could even make a “six dollar man” robot for just under six dollars (including taxes).  Just keep in mind that if you lowball the standard cost for the desired invention too much, the perk will lead you into finding substandard items that, while technically functional, will cause the machine to malfunction."
19,,200CP,A Box of Scraps ,Honkai Impact Third,Domain: Quality: Resources,"For rather straightforward inventions you can make them with just about anything if you have the knowledge of how the mechanics of it work. Simple substitutes are easy and you have the ability to fix things easily, able to patch things up with little more than chewing gum as a quick fix that will last a while."
20,,200CP,Advanced Materials ,XCOM 2,Domain: Quality: Resources,"As you experiment the physics and rules of a world ideas for new materials come to you. Elements and compounds from different universes often follow the same rules after all, so it should be theoretically possible to mix them. While you are developing new materials for your projects you will instinctively know whether or not materials will be compatible with each other and roughly how strong they will be. You will not know the exact ratio or procedure you will need to perform to fabricate these exotic materials, and it's not guaranteed that every material will be compatible with each other, but development will be made a lot easier."
21,,200CP,Astromancy ,A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Maybe you were born under a rare cosmological sign, maybe the planets aligned upon your arrival, or maybe it's just luck but your connection to the stars and the movement of the spheres grants you a greater sense of time and the seasons. You know the exact date down to the millisecond if you just think about it, the perfect time to harvest ingredients or plant a garden, and the effect of the cosmos on the world. More than that the stars and their mysteries have an effect on you as well, your magic will be stronger at night some signs and planets affecting certain spells more than others, you'll have endless stamina during the full moon, and possess perfect night vision. You'll also be capable of finding and harvesting truly rare ingredients such as stardust, sunshards, moonbeams, shadow threads, etc. You'll also have a natural understanding of the prophetic significance of the passage of the celestial bodies in the sky, day or night. Those conversations with centaurs will finally make sense to you."
22,,200CP,Built-In Geo-Nav ,Dead Space,Domain: Quality: Resources,"It's like you have a rare materials detector built into your head, with how easy you make it seem to find the really good stuff. Whenever you're looking for materials, be it rare metals, gemstones or crystals, or even just treasure in general, you can feel something, ""pulling,"" your new quasi-sense in various directions, and in different ways based on what the material in question is. As a side benefit, this enhances your ability to navigate, allowing you to, in almost all cases, just kind of know the right direction to head in, to the point that your RIG will mark a path towards your hunch."
23,,200CP,Cold Fires ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain: Quality: Resources,"The hotter the fire, the easier the metal is to form -but too hot, and the metal will simply melt away. That's always been a conundrum which you had to solve. The mages however, have a different solution for your problem. By imbuing fire with Aether, you can reach the conditions necessary for forging at far lower temperatures than normal. Similarly, the intensity of any fire spell you cast is significantly increased."
24,,200CP,Delirium ,Ravenwood,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Raw skill, talent, or ability, with a touch of madness. You possess the ability to collect Delirium, a raw form of drug-like ki formed from madness and chaos. The battlefield is rife with this chaotic energy. Using delirium, it is possible to push a skill to insane levels, and allow for surprising uses of your abilities."
25,,200CP,Duct Tape Master ,CATastrophe,Domain: Quality: Resources,Earless relics aren't the only thing that's shiny. You're a master at jerry-rigging mechanical components into an ungodly abomination of gears and circuits that somehow still works as intended. Fixing broken things is a breeze (though they might break more easily now) and making new teknologee by recycling parts from old ones is within the realm of your skills.
26,,200CP,Eccentric Talk ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Quality: Resources,"It's so not cool to run out of bullets in the middle of a firefight. Dramatic? Sure, at the right time, but it is hella not fun to find yourself in that situation. Seems like you needn't worry from now on as any weapon you have just doesn't run out of ammunition. Whether it uses bullets or energy or something weird like rocks or rubbish, it looks like firing that stuff out doesn't actually get rid of it from within the weapon itself. Emptying the gun wouldn't let you take out as much ammo as you want, it only works when you're actually using it in the weapon."
27,,200CP,Essencetapping ,Aion,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You know the basics of magically extracting valuable materials from your surroundings in a way that won't damage the environment or source. In addition; post-jump, you may use this ability to gather resources native to other settings. You have mastered extracting all but the most exotic materials, and as an added bonus; you often find rare materials in your endeavours. Also, your post-jump essencetapping will find the occasional Atreian material gathered alongside native ones."
28,,200CP,Garbage Bin Grants ,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Quality: Resources,"The sad truth is that artists starve and so do scientists. A certain number of resources will be eventually poured into a project and often enough the Genius in question finds themselves grasping for one last essential component but with little to no money left. You are unusually adept at finding useful components in the most unlikely places. As long as you have a garbage respiratory that can viably hold things that you need for a project, such as computer parts in a junkyard or car parts at an impound, you have a great likelihood of finding what you are looking for, and even finding things that you wouldn't expect on site that will help with future projects."
29,,200CP,House Calls ,Stargate Atlantis,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Perform surgery and even medical research without being hindered by the lack of proper operating theatre or the locals' less-than-sophisticated equipment. You still need some sort of equipment, or a space for surgery, but dodgy equipment or a dodgy place to operate won't hamper you."
30,,200CP,Hunt Automation ,Mousehunt,Domain: Quality: Resources,"If you're a hunter who relies exclusively on traps, the process of setting up a trap and waiting for a bite can get quite monotonous, even as you venture into unknown regions and get a chance to sightsee. Why not have the trap micromanage itself even more, so you don't have to sit and wait to reset the mechanism? For all of the traps at your disposal, you can arrange for them to automatically clean up and re-arm themselves, this only pulls a small bit of energy or stamina from you each time it activates, which can also serve as indication that your traps have triggered. Even in the event that your traps are destroyed, you can expend a greater portion of energy for them to reform themselves while you're doing something else provided that they aren't erased out of existence entirely anyways."
31,,200CP,None Wasted ,Earth Girls,Domain: Quality: Resources,"An ordinary butcher can get every edible scrap from a carcass. An excellent one, like yourself, can make sure every usable scrap is harvested. Even though you cut up an animal for meat, you save the hide in a perfect state for tanning, the tallow for burning or other use, the guts for strings. This also comes with the knowledge to preserve the parts correctly and tan leather the stone-age way."
32,,200CP,Nuts And Bolts ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Okay, so you're tough and you can snatch a few wallets. But you know what a good start for making some money is? Salvage. You're excellent at finding useful parts and mundane materials on the fly. Need metal? Those old railroad spikes look handy. Need some wires? There's an intact bundle in that old machine over there. As it turns out, this also makes you pretty good at shoving these parts together to make something good...or at least something you can sell. Weirdo stuff like intact alien tech, special parts, or 'exotic' materials need a bit more work to get depending on how rare they are, but the effort's worth it, right?"
33,,200CP,Professional Plunderer ,God Catching Alchemy Meister,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Monsters are a curious thing, they destroy and threaten people on a daily basis, however, the drops and loot from hunting them can be highly profitable, especially from high-level ones in the hands of a skilled alchemist. Good artifacts need good materials and professional hands. In that sense, you got the first half in the bag already. You have insane luck when it comes to harvesting or looting raw materials, often encountering more than you wanted, of better quality and from time to time even drops far better than average."
34,,200CP,Reclaimer ,Smash Up,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Not all parts are interchangeable, but the secret to fitting a square peg in a round hole is just to get a really good lathe to file the corners off with. You are the master of adapting parts to do wildly different jobs for systems they were never designed to interface with, even if you have to build the interface yourself."
35,,200CP,Reclaimer | Lingua-Technis ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Rare is the heretek with wealth or connections enough to acquire the resources to pursue innovation without raising suspicion. Most must make do with whatever they can scavenge or build for themselves, and fortune seems to often favor them when harvesting useful components from wrecked machines. More often than not, the most delicate and valuable pieces of technology can be pulled intact from wrecks you find or create.
Lingua-Technis (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (FREE) Known only to the devotees of the Machine God despite the best efforts of outsiders over millennia, the adepts of Mars speak to each other in bursts of binaric code. This allows for a great deal of information to be communicated quickly and discreetly. Even if translated, it is a complex language thick with ancient and arcane terminology that few outsiders could ever hope to make any sense of. This language allows you to communicate quickly with other adepts, transferring messages and code many times faster than ordinary speech."
36,,200CP,Scrap Diving ,Smash Up,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Whenever searching for salvage, you're incredibly lucky in finding the parts you need."
37,,200CP,Scrounging ,Arcanum Of Steamworks And Magic Obscura,Domain: Quality: Resources,"It's a sad fact that finding the right materials and components for your research and manufacturing can be a difficult task. Collecting the necessary tools to create Molotov Cocktails and Healing Salves might be fairly easy, but for more complex devices it can take days to find the things you need. Lesser inventors might need to keep track of every source of tools, from the General Store to the local junk merchant to areas for finding medicinal herbs... but not you! Your keen sense for finding the materials you need means you'll always have a vague idea of just where to go to buy that Minute Steamworks, Tesla Coil, or Spirit Of Camphor, and you're quite likely to walk into the store right when they're on discount. Amazing!"
38,,200CP,Universal Ammunition ,Dead Space,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Plasma batteries? Javelin spears? Force energy? What are those? The only thing you ever seem to find, from here on out, as far as ammunition goes, aside from special ammo types, are these little gunmetal black and yellow battery-like ammo cartridges. The exchange rate varies from gun type to gun type, one clip, or magazine, or cartridge, or whatever, at a time, but it's always enough to fill the gun you're using. Just don't think about the logistics of having a single kind of ammunition that just works for every gun possible, pretend like it makes sense in the space future, and we'll all be just fine."
39,,300CP,"Automatic Looting | Waste Not, Want Not ",Mass Effect Andromeda,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Automatic Looting (100CP) A Technician can be called in to fix things in the middle of a fight. But when your focus is on keeping your head on your shoulders, who has time to pick up those supplies you ran past 3 hours ago? You, that's who! You now have two things: First, you have some sort of pocket-universe/bag-of-holding/bigger-on-the-inside backpack/whatever that allows you to carry a large amount of loot. The loot will be unsorted, and while you can carry a lot and not notice, you also cannot immediately use what's in your loot bag. You'll first have to have your mineral wealth in the right place to build something with it, and equipment needs to actually be equipped before it can be used. Second, you gain a sort of aura or field that will automatically put anything (that hasn't been claimed by another being) nearby you into your loot bag. Stumble across a dead Kett, you get all the loot a thorough check would have found you if you'd taken your time. A farmer's vegetable field wouldn't work, unless you are knowingly stealing from the owner. The size of the looting-aura grows with how quickly you can move and what areas you can actually access. And the loot you get is determined by your skills. For example, if you have butchery skills, you can auto-loot meat, bones, and/or skin, while skills with electronics would let you get intact pieces of robots. The size of a single item would go up to and include a shuttle or the Nomad. If you run into something bigger than that, you'd need to have the skills to break it down to fit it.
Waste Not, Want Not (200CP) Sometimes a Technician just doesn't have the resources they need to get the job done. That's when you have to get creative with what you consider a resource. You have the ability to break down objects that you can personally move into their component parts and/or resources, whichever you wish. If you need a bit of Eezo, an Initiative gun should have some. Don't want to murder some harmless Eirochs? Kett gear usually has some Eiroch Fluid Sacs incorporated into it. In addition to breaking down objects, you also have an accompanying pocket dimension for just resources and/or component parts. It doesn't weigh on you, and you can easily carry around enough resources for any job. If you have the Automatic Looting perk, you can choose to have any raw resources you pick up to go straight into your Resources Bag. And any crafting you do can pull straight from your Resources Bag."
40,,300CP,Crimson Weapons ,Etrian Odyssey,Domain: Quality: Resources,"When you look at the various giblets you carve off of the monsters of the labyrinth, you find many of their parts are suitable for crafting weapons and armor. In fact, they're usually outright superior to regular materials. With time and effort, you could make just about anything you pry off of a monster into something useful. You could turn a lion's claws into a wicked-sharp sword, or a pair of horns into an excellent bow."
41,,300CP,Makeshift Weaponry ,Bartimaeus Sequence,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Did you just duct tape that magic wand together? Never mind, apparently you CAN do that. Using exceedingly mundane tools, you are able to repair and make improvements to weapons that by all rights shouldn't be able to be repaired that way. Why yes, you CAN glue the detonation stick back together and make it work just fine. Oh and don't worry about that shattered elemental sphere, we can just tie it back together with twine!"
42,,300CP,More With Less ,XCOM,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Through careful construction, you can remove unnecessary components and get maximum efficiency into your products. What this means, is that you can create the same quality item while using less resources. Items with which you have a limited supply, such as alien materials, can be stretched farther."
43,,300CP,No Monsters Were Harmed in the Making of This Product ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Quality: Resources,"The bodies of monsters are useful resources for all sorts of things (Dragon scales make nifty armor, Slime substances can be used for various potions/elixirs, Demon Realm Boar meat is incredibly healthy and invigorating, etc.), so now that monsters are friendly (sometimes too friendly), it's become easier to obtain these once-rare ingredients. However, this leads to a dilemma: how to extract the items without hurting the innocent Mamono. At the lowest level, this perk helps you sense what parts of a creature's body could be useful/profitable (it won't help you exactly identify their use, but it will at least let you know if they're worth taking a look at). But more than that, the perk enables you to easily extract things from a subject's body without actually harming the individual, even if doing so would normally hurt or even kill the person. The subject will generally heal any scars without trouble afterwards, and any removed parts that are irreplaceable will regenerate. Plus, you gain increased skill at preserving the extracted materials for extended durations until you can find a good use for them or hawk them off to buyers."
44,,300CP,Salvager ,Babylon 5,Domain: Quality: Resources,"When the ore runs out and the company tells the miners to leave, that's where you really shine. It's cheaper to leave gear to rot in an abandoned site than it is to get it into orbit, across the galaxy and set up again so there's always something good just waiting for a new owner. With this skill you are an expert at jury rigging tech, taking it apart, stripping out the usable parts and putting them into something else. With time and effort you can puzzle out the workings of most technologies and how to integrate them into your own gear. Every day or industrial equipment might take a few moments, but bleeding edge gear will take years, even decades to understand."
45,,300CP,Scrapper ,Fallout 4,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You have the capability to dismantle and repurpose objects for your own creations; even ones that you might not fully understand. So long as it's not hopelessly beyond your understanding, indestructible, or ridiculously big, you're capable of taking most things and reducing them to their base components, salvaging any working parts with only a few days of work at the worst."
46,,300CP,Scrapyard Skills ,Swat Kats,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Where others see junk, you see treasure just waiting to be utilized. You can make far more use out of scrap metal and tossed out electronics, repurposing them for many different tasks. That washer machine might have the parts needed to help spin an engine turbine, or that piston tube might be JUST the right size to refashion into a grappling hook launcher... it's all in how you use it and how you repurpose things."
47,,300CP,Waste Not ,Monster Hunter,Domain: Quality: Resources,Use half as many resources as usual with a chance of not needing rare materials at all.
48,,400CP,Arcane Emulation ,D&D Eberron,Domain: Quality: Resources,"To enchant is to create the greatest of items. To enchant without magic is pure bullshit, but is doable with certain tricks shared only amongst the most secretive of crafters. Thanks either to learning from them or to discovering these abilities yourself, you can craft magical items without the need for related spellcasting. Further, you know all the little tricks to minimise the resource costs of your items, which whilst minimal by themselves add up to maybe halving the total time and resource expenditure per item."
49,,400CP,Efficiency ,Ninjango - Masters of Spinjitzu,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Waste not, want not! Not with this, anyway whether building machines or making quick moves in combat, you'll never unintentionally use more energy, materials, or flourish than you need to."
50,,400CP,Heart of Fire | Quick Seed ,Nexus 2.0,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Heart of Fire (200CP) Fire Elementals possess a form of magic called the Ember. This magic grants incredible resistance, bordering on immunity, to heat and flames, though it does nothing for the pain that heat can cause. However, that is merely a side effect. The true use of Ember is as a form of refinement, materials exposed to ember infused flame have their traits enhanced. Food becomes tastier and more nutritious, metals become more resilient, and potions last longer or have an increased effect. This does, however, require the material to be exposed to flame, so this will not work on certain materials.
Quick Seed (200CP) Seeds are normally slow to grow, with more Light potentially cracking it open and wasting the effort. Sapphire goblins, however, have taken what many would consider a hazard and turned it into an art. Any Seed formed by a sapphire goblin is more stable, able to be pushed farther before it breaks open, allowing them to build them up faster. Additionally, in moments of need, a sapphire goblin can overload a Seed, holding it together just long enough to overpower it, before they let it break to use the Seed at a much higher power than normal."
51,,400CP,"High-Tech, Meet Low-Tech ",Revelation Space,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Beyond the Yellowstone system, technology is often not quite up to speed. More so, in the Post-Melding time. Colonists isolated by lightyears from their nearest neighbors must be ready to handle any failure of their machines, so reliable, low technology is usually more common than quickmatter and full automation. Yet when it comes to merging the two, you have a fascinating ability to keep high-technology devices running by replacing failing systems with low-tech equivalents. Where a space station might have used superconductor radiator panels to manage temperature, you could find a way to replace them with steam cooling; when your shuttles run out of antimatter, you'll find it easy to replace those drives with a fusion torch or even chemical rockets. At the extreme limits of your ability, you might replace a simple but essential computer with a mechanical calculator, crunching out numbers with cogs, punch cards and levers."
52,,400CP,Honor the Machine Spirit ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Apothecaries tend to the bodies of the dead, Chaplains to their spirits. Techmarines tend to the spirits of the Machine. You are a skilled salvager. For example, while others might see a destroyed tank, you can see a way to salvage usable parts, perhaps restoring another vehicle to fighting trim or finding a way to save unique weapon systems to be re-used another day. This also gives you a strong grounding in the Rites of Reverse Engineering, able to examine unknown technology and figure out basic functionality by comparing it to devices you are already familiar with. You also have a much broader definition of the word 'damaged', able to restore machinery that others would swear was inoperable or destroyed given enough time and as long as you have enough of the original damaged parts to work with."
53,,400CP,Lack of Materials,God of War,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Times are tough in this land. Forces beyond knowing, monsters that roam the lands, and gods who are as petty as they are powerful. With chaos such as this, there are times you may not be able to get everything that you need. But you've learned to make do. You can get the most out of your materials, using two bars of metal where you might need four, or three hides when you need six. Of course, if you DO have all the materials required you can use them to make your creations more effective in quality and capability as well. So maybe it doesn't hurt to put the extra mile in."
54,,400CP,Making Do With Less ,Freefall,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Is your last name Ambrose or perhaps MacGyver? Any time you use materials, they always seem to just work better than they should. Utterly useless scraps become usable if makeshift repairs and construction. Decent stuff is spun into great, great to esoteric, esoteric to outright absurd results. If used on the same thing twice, it won't enhance previously affected pieces further, though newly added bits would be. So long as you already had the skills, you could get a ship space worthy using only the random stuff that a none too knowledgeable thief happened to scrounge together. If you already had a perk that improved the effective quality/usefulness of materials, this would be added on top of that."
55,,400CP,Mauler ,Command and Conquer: Tiberium Wars,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You have the skills of a junkyard hound, able to make even the most heavily damaged tech work again. Even machines too battle-damaged for recovery 20 years ago can be effective under your wrench. Repurposing tech and equipment is your forte; you can turn a pneumatic screwdriver into a reasonable cannon, and heaven help your enemies if you get anywhere near mining equipment, as a power-armored mutant is quickly appearing in their future. There was even one time where you made a toaster into a reasonable facsimile of a flamethrower....."
56,,400CP,Monster Harvesting ,Warhammer Fantasy - Amazons,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Without the power of industry or technology that civilisations like the empire have access to, the Amazons have learnt to be resourceful in other ways. They and now you have become masters of taking the bodies of fallen foes and turning them into weapons, tools and armour. Not only are these removed parts of enemies just as effective as when the enemy was alive, they even retain any special powers or magical qualities they had at the time, even if the being would normally need to be alive to supply those powers. Poisonous fangs will continue to bleed venom even after being torn from a giant snake's mouth and turned into a sword, whilst a monster that naturally produced magical wards would continue to do so even when it's hide had been stripped and turned to armour. Along with this skill for harvesting comes notable talent for creating weapons, armour and tools."
57,,400CP,Resource Efficiency ,Mass Effect Andromeda,Domain: Quality: Resources,"It's nice being efficient. It lets you make more with less, stretching out vital supplies even further. With this perk, any time you are crafting something, you can make it for half the materials. Just don't ask how you got a full cake from half the amount of ingredients. In addition, anytime you break down an item, you get the full amount of resources that went into it. So, breaking down a gun you made for 50% resources would give you those 50% resources, compared to a gun made by someone else who used the full amount in the construction, and thus giving you the total amount."
58,,400CP,Scavenge ,Hellgate London,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You can find usable food and materials anywhere you look, even if you search a empty gas station you are bound to find at least a couple boxes of whatever ammunition you use and some food. When used on equipment or electronics you always find whatever parts would be useful to you."
59,,400CP,Scavenger ,Megaman Zero,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You have a knack for integrating junk into your systems or gear and for using them to make field repairs. After all self-repair systems only go so far. You're good at finding compatible parts and at jury-rigging them for the above purposes. That buster could replace the rifle in your arm. While that torso could be scavenged from for repair your own though these parts will not work fully if faulty, and you can't integrate parts too different from or incompatible with whatever you're integrating It into. This allows for free upgrades and repairs, as well as self-sufficiency. Perfect for long solo assignments or just survival. Waste not, Want not."
60,,400CP,Scavenger ,Squirrel and Hedgehog,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Thanks to those filthy communists trying to take everything (hypocrisy, anyone?), you've had to learn to make do on things. You can get more 'bang for your buck' on materials and fuels, making machines last longer than they normally should. Furthermore, with crafting and building you know JUST how to use them to reduce your resource requirements. How's THAT for 'not needing unnecessarily' you goobers?!"
61,,400CP,Scrap Warrior ,Generic Wretched Hive,Domain: Quality: Resources,"One man's trash is another man's armoury. Rocks, shivs, Molotov cocktails, Armor made of scrap. Whenever junk is all you've got it can somehow put up a good show against things far more sophisticated. Shivs find chinks in mil-spec gear. Rocks crack armored windows, while crowbars pry open security doors. It's not an equal footing, but it'll close the gap and turn a hopeless fight into something a lot less one-sided."
62,,400CP,Ship's Engineer ,Smash Up,Domain: Quality: Resources,"It takes a lot of know-how to keep a spaceship running, especially with all the things they get put through. Not only are you an expert in the technology of the future, you've learned how to be incredibly resourceful in improvising technology. From using lasers to heat rocks or forge metals, to building a laser with the contents of a prison cell, if an Engineer doesn't have the tools they need, well they'll make the tools themselves!"
63,,400CP,Shipping the Product ,F.E.A.R.,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Prototypes are one thing, but what about actually getting the damn thing distributed? An item or weapon doesn't help anyone if it's the only one of its kind. You will find your ability to create has increased dramatically in efficiency, letting you use the materials for three of the same items to actually make five while streamlining production lines rather quickly. As a bonus, logistics have increased enough where your shipped supplies are harder to intercept, keeping any allies you have fresh with resources!"
64,,400CP,Ultra-High Settings ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Resources,"While many may wish they had the beastly computers needed to run games on max settings, many don't. But why should we limit the beauty of your art for such a mundane reason? Your art and animations are such that no matter how hi-res the models or complex the animation it will have a minimal, if any, impact on how well your game runs. This also applies to other items and products you help create, meaning even the shittiest of computers or consoles can run your game at the highest resolution without suffering too much, while products like swords can have designs might seem to hinder a user's ability to swing it when in fact it's just as usable as a normal one."
65,,400CP,Unfed Forge,Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse,Domain: Quality: Resources,"The biggest problem with techniques or artifacts is that eventually, if you don't rise in power, status, or connections, you won't be able to procure the necessary materials needed to also bring your power up to par with others at your level. So I'd say it's a good thing that you have the ability to use the same materials at lower levels to create things at your level of power. If you felt like it you could use Steel to make a Golem capable of killing Celestial Immortals while you were a World God. With materials meant for actual immortals, even baseline Celestial Immortals, you would be able to create artifacts capable of comparing to Universe treasures while weaker than Hegemons assuming you have such a mastery of forging."
66,,600CP,Extraction Efficiency | Harmless Extraction | Rapid Growth ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Extraction Efficiency (100CP) Judging from the state of Eorzea, the Carpenters and other tradesmen here have long since improved the efficiency of their resource collecting processes. From the record books, while the presence of Aether has helped a great deal, the harvesting practices put into place played a large part as to why the natural landscape is still the way it is today. Adopting those same practices, you've improved on the harvesting efficiency for all manners of things, not just restricted to trees -but other plant life as well. So at least the plant doesn't simply die off after one round.
Harmless Extraction (200CP) With hempen yarn and animal skins in shorter supply since the catastrophe, you and other craftsmen have had to adapt your practices in order to keep the orders met. Practices to minimize the amount of animals killed, to make the most out of that which you have on hand are all crucial nowadays as resources grow scarcer. While the animals still aren't too comfortable with it, with this magic you can weave together a copy of their skin or wool, while only taking a small portion of what they have. It doesn't really feel right, but at least the animal is still alive! It'll take time, but what you've taken will slowly grow back.
Rapid Growth (200CP) You can't afford to wait years for a forest to regrow! By the time that forest grows to a state where it's ready for harvest, you won't even need the lumber to build your house anymore! No, in order to make it in time for harvest this season, you're going to need to draw on some more potent forces.It might be a little bit dangerous to use Aether in such a fashion, but by imbuing the saplings with concentrated Aether, you've successfully sped up the growth rate of the trees -to a point where you can harvest them again. Well, unfortunately, the trees did grow a bit bigger than normal, but you expect that's just a normal side effect from using concentrated Aether to grow things."
67,,600CP,2x4 tech genius ,Kids Next Door,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You're able to put together incredible creations from simple household objects. A piece of wood, a battery, a glass bottle, and some duct tape, you can turn it into a working laser rifle. Everything that you make will be very fragile, and more complex creations will require more complex components."
68,,600CP,Hunter Package Tier Two: Fragment of the Dream ,Generic Island Castaway,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You are exceptionally skilled at harvesting your kills, as well as preserving them for as long as possible with minimal resources, and you can make use of the materials within an animal's body with great ease, forming bone tools and leather objects in less time then it should take to make them.
Fragment of the dream tier two would allow you to harvest a beast with nary but a touch and ensure that your animal products never spoil."
69,,600CP,Lost Art ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You are now an expert of the lost art, the art of code efficiency. Any code and software you make will now be far more efficient, using up far less resources for the same results and running significantly faster than most standard code. Your game would normally be 16GB and requires 8GB of RAM? Now it uses half that, at least. Game causing lag and crashing because too much is going on? Not anymore. Whatever you code, it'll run fast, and it'll run well."
70,,600CP,Mana Substitution ,Generic Builder,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Lacking materials needed for your building? Use magic to permanently create them from nothing if you have blueprints for them (rare, powerful or combined materials take more magic)."
71,,600CP,Power Of The Pixel ,Starbound,Domain: Quality: Resources,"The pixel is both a form of currency, and a building block for making almost anything. This marvelous technology is the secret behind most manufacturing in the galaxy, and now, you possess this power as an innate ability. You can take any item that you own and break it down into pixels (with minimal lossage), based on its substance, power, and value. You can also take pixels and shape them into any item that you know the structure of, at a pixel cost equal to said items substance, power, and value. This power can extend to other forms of currency as well, though it does require actually physical currency to work. Please note, this power operates off of the actual value of the object, not any fiat value. You will get the same small amount of pixels for an ordinary pebble, even if you manage to get someone to sell it for thousands of dollars."
72,,600CP,Practical Applications ,Family Matters,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You have a gift, not for a specific skill, but for applying your skills. Even in bad conditions, with limited resources, you can still get the job done. Whether it is turning ketchup and water into spaghetti sauce, or building technological marvels in your basement from a pile of odd parts, you can make things work, even in circumstances that are considerably less than optimal. You are also extremely innovative and creative with your skills, easily finding inspiration and motivation for your projects."
73,,600CP,"REPAIR, REUSE, RECYCLE ",PREY,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Neuromods aren't the only revolutionary technology developed on Talos I. The ability to break down components to their constituent materials and dividing them into 4 categories of materials which can be used by a fabricator to make almost anything. These are divided into Synthetic, Mineral, Organic and Exotic. You know all the ins and outs of this technology, able to make it more precise in dividing up material up to the elemental level or divide new materials at the cost of a little more energy. Scaled up you could use these devices to quickly refine mined material strip mined from a planet and use them to mass produce buildings and vehicles. The energy required to make the item is directly proportional to their complexity and size."
74,,600CP,Savvy Scavenger ,SimAnt,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Good to the last drop! When you discover a resource, you become aware of exactly how much is available and how much is left to collect. Never leave a single grain, a single drop or a single coin behind ever again."
75,,600CP,Scavenger ,Generic Space Opera,Domain: Quality: Resources,"You have an excellent intuition when it comes to finding and salvaging still functional technology. You can see at a glance if a device is still functional and have a general intuition on how to use it and what the effects would be. You also have the uncanny ability to pick out still functional components of unknown tech and can kludge together temporary fixes of technology vastly beyond your understanding, though those will break down and make said technology unrecoverable after a while."
76,,600CP,The Way of the Cube ,Unmodded Minecraft,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Whether you were born to the cube or merely adopted it, you have internalized some of the principles of this world and made them your own. When you harvest something, you can choose to have it fall apart into whatever shapes and portions you desire. Pluck a plant from your garden or slaughter an animal from your stables, and they will be instantly and perfectly divided up among edible portions,usable materials and all other categories without the slightest waste. Things harvested with this perk are also just better, blemishes, damage and imperfections corrected during the process. This perk can't be used as a form of attack, so no punching the bones out of someone that bothers you."
77,,600CP,You Built it Out of What? ,DC - Blackest Night,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Would you believe the Cosmic Divining Rod, the source of this oncoming disaster, was built out of a mishmash of parts found in a hardware store in some corner on Earth? Whether from your own mastery of engineering or similar mad inspiration, you have a knack for constructing advanced devices out of nothing but common Earth parts and other easy-to-obtain materials. Spaceships made of salvaged parts? Sure. A rod capable of contacting a particular Entity and manipulating emotions? Why not? You can also apply this to other science or engineering you're capable of, substituting rare materials with common parts, and working with as much durability and effectiveness as the real thing."
78,,700CP,Gatherer Package Tier One | Two | Three ,Generic Island Castaway,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Gatherer Package Tier One (100CP) You are an exceptional gatherer and have a knowledge base geared toward this; you can easily locate edible or medicinal plants and animal byproducts and tell at a glance whether a plant or animal byproduct has useful characteristics as well if it is at the bestpoint of its cycle for use or consumption.
Gatherer Package Tier Two (200CP) You can gather plant-based materials or animal byproducts somewhat out of their growing season as well as prevent their spoilage for longer than it should be possible.
Gatherers Package Tier Three (400CP) When you gather plant-based materials or animal byproducts you collect more than are physically present, and when you consume them they are more effective than they should be."
79,,800CP,Research and Deploy,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Quality: Resources,"The secrets of research and duplication are now at your fingertips, though there are a few changes compared to the version from the game. The basic process is still the same. You can 'destructively research' a given item in your inventory or that you can and are holding entirely in your hands, and once you have researched enough of them, you will be able to instantly duplicate said item. However, you aren't able to simply duplicate it for free. Instead, you can sacrifice additional items to build up a reservoir of 'material' that can then be used to create duplicates. Rarer items provide more material, with the amount needed to research a given item being a general baseline. So, if it took 100 items to research one item, and only 1 item to research another, then you would have to sacrifice 100 more of the first item to make one duplicate of the second. A second change is that the number of items that must be researched has been increased. Items that normally might have only taken 1 item to research now need 3 or more, and an item that might have normally taken 10 could take 40 or 50. CP-Backed items can be researched, but their duplicates won't have their CP-backed powers, only the default powers of whatever type of item they are. You can substitute raw mana for 'material', allowing you to create items without having to sacrifice other items first, as long as you have a sufficient amount of mana."
80,,800CP,Reusable Resources | Artificial Alloys ,Anno 2070,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Reusable Resources (200CP) Recycling requires effort. There is always a loss - in terms of energy, in terms of time, in terms of effort, in terms of materials. Your faction's knowledge of materials science has minimized this loss to the utmost; When destroying buildings, recovering crashed vehicles, or decommissioning equipment, you always recover the same amount of material put into its construction, ripe for being re-applied to other tasks.
Artificial Alloys (600CP) Naturally occurring substances can offer a good start point for the development of new and innovative machinery and technology. However, oftentimes these natural resources have limitations - whether it be rarity, difficulty of acquisition, and so on. In such cases, science steps to the fore, fashioning new materials unseen by nature to do that which mother nature started. This ability allows, with enough time and research invested, to create substances that mimic those found in nature, albeit manufactured artificially. While these new artificial substances do not surpass the original, it can for all purposes be substituted by it with no drawbacks. However, the material must still be manufactured - but, once the process is known, other factions, civilizations, and individuals, by following the process, can also create the artificial material. This ability works post-jump, even for materials that do not naturally occur in the new universe."
81,,900CP,Panzerkampf | Firestorm ,Sabaton,Domain: Quality: Resources,"Panzerkampf (300CP) When it comes to building war machines, yours are top-notch! A gun made by your own hand will never jam, and a tank built by you will never bog down in mud or take damage from an IED. If they want to destroy what you've built, they'd best bring their A-game.
Firestorm (600CP) When someone absolutely, positively needs artillery good enough to reduce the greatest castle to rubble, they come to you and accept no substitutes. You can throw a cannon together from scraps and it will still outperform the best mortars of the age. Moreover, in other worlds, if you can understand the weapon, you can produce something 1.1 times as strong with the items you would find in a rubbish heap, provided they're of equal size to the device they're replicating."
