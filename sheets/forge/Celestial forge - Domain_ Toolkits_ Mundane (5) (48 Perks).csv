1,,50CP,Diagnostic Tools ,Outlaw Star,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A small data display with numerous connectors and scanners, capable of letting you know what is wrong with simple technology and what advanced technology that has been programmed into it.
* Portable, can detect what's wrong with simple tech and do the same for advanced tech that you program into it.
* Keep in mind 'simple' is a lot lot higher than modern tech for this scanner, it's from a space fiction."
2,,50CP,Habitat Constructor ,Subnautica,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"As long as the materials are present in your subspace inventory, the Habitat Constructor is capable of creating robust outposts and domiciles. Due to complex structural requirements, the constructor is unable to build anything that isn't anchored to the ground.
* ""Complex structural requirements"" implies that with sufficient technical abilities this limitation can be overcome."
3,,50CP,Holotable ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A device in the shape of a table used to create holographic models that allow the study, analysis and reconstruction of a vast array of items, weapons and events. Comes in any color of holograms you like and each hologram is capable of being interacted with. Naturally this performs better with additional data."
4,,50CP,Micromanipulators ,A Certain Scientific Railgun,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"These delicate gloves were meant for scientific purposes. They're reinforced with small motors and electrically contracting artificial muscles to allow you to perform delicate work on the scale of a micron. While they're definitely more suited to scientific experiments, they can be put to use in any situation that requires steady hands like aiming a rifle, conducting brain surgery, cooking, defusing a bomb, or even bypassing some redirection and shielding abilities. * Micron scale control"
5,,50CP,Tool Chest ,Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"You receive a variant of the normal personal chest. This has more slots to fit more varieties of items, but only a few slots are full-sized. It's ideal for storing a variety of tools, or the small amounts of various gubbins you find around drop pods. In addition, you receive a blueprint to make copies. All copies of the Tool Chest share inventory - while the copies will not give additional space, that inventory can be accessed from anywhere. As long as at least one copy of the Tool Chest is placed in the world, any items stored in it will continue to exist"
6,,100CP,Box Of Hammers ,Lego Dimensions,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"You can buy this box of hammers instead. This box comes with a dozen or so hammers, each of which grants the one holding it a copy of the Builder Power
* Builder: You can build a mountain, if you do it brick by brick. Given all of the relevant pieces, and some sort of instructions on what to make, you can build almost any object quickly and efficiently by slotting the various pieces together. IKEA instructions are no match for your building might."
7,,100CP,Chemical Synthesizer ,Hive Queen Quest,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"This microwave sized machine is truly a wonder of modern science, able to synthesize any non-magical chemical known to man in up to 12 oz batches. Synthesizing a chemical takes roughly an hour and works via a small Tablet interface.
* A bit underpriced for any matter creator, even with the small volume and time needed, born from lacking knowledge that ever matter falls under chemical."
8,,100CP,Cranial implants ,Warhammer 40k: Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"The brain of every magos undergoes extensive modification over time, but you have put great care into preparing your mind for the Machine God's mysteries. Beyond the gene-alterations and bionic sub-systems that have boosted your intelligence, regulated neuro-chemistry reduces the influence that hunger, pain, fear and other flesh-distractions can have upon your thoughts. Your ability to enjoy these things are not impeded. Further neurological modifications will be faster and easier to adapt to with less worry of rejection."
9,,100CP,Data Access ,Endless Pantheon,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"Having knowledge isn't always good enough, seeing as it can be quite the hassle to actually access it if you don't have the proper setup. You do, thankfully. This is one device of your choosing, which allows you to perfectly access any and all books, scrolls or databanks you have, putting all of the knowledge you have gathered at your fingertips at all times. It can also change forms, but is always something digital. Try not to stand too close to the wizard."
10,,100CP,Deep pockets ,Endless Pantheon,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A small bag filled with some absolute essential things, this is the sort of thing that can save your life. It's tiny, and enchanted so it can't be detected with any supernatural means. What it does is provide you with a tiny portal to your warehouse, big enough to draw out anything an ordinary man can lift with one hand."
11,,100CP,Exo-Womb ,Freefall,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"The first generation of Bowman's Wolves were gestated in dogs with genetically modified red wolf DNA. Now you can have your future generations be developed in a more controlled environment. Simply insert one or more viable biological samples that are no smaller than a single drop of blood into the receptacle and this will provide a perfect and indestructible environment for the child. If you are one of the donors, any perks relating to children and inheritance may apply. It takes the typical amount of time and only works with organisms of the same species unless you have perks to alter that."
12,,100CP,Jewelry Set ,Timespinner,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A set of tools for crafting jewelry or rings, as well as a small amount of material for making them, such as gold, silver, or gemstones. The provided material will replenish once a month if used."
13,,100CP,Magic Hammer ,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A large unadorned metal hammer, any item struck by this hammer will experience an increase in durability and item condition. This effect can't push them past the condition they were in when new, but it does scale with the force behind the hammer blow, with small taps removing minor dents, while powerful blows can fix major cracks in a single go."
14,,100CP,Matter Manipulator ,Starbound,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"Manipulates anything that matters. Well,solids, at least. It basically allows for the collection of any and all materials. For an extra 100 CP, it can collect liquid, and also mines 4 times faster, 4 times as much at once and twice as far away. It can also paint stuff as wire things. If you don't purchase this, you'll have to get the upgrades yourself with manipulator modules.
* This is the 4chan version, the SB version is a whole chapter."
15,,100CP,Satisfactorio Builder | Craft Bench Card | Pattern Extension Chip,Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"-Satisfactorio Builder (0CP) The buildy gun from Satisfactory. It can place down buildings and other artificial structures, either from parts or premade. It can deconstruct buildings and other artificial objects, either breaking them down or storing them whole. It can give orders to logistic or construction systems that you are authorized on (including the ones from this Gauntlet.) It can configure the settings of machines. It has an internal inventory that can be upgraded (to a limited extent until you leave the Gauntlet). Always fully charged, can be upgraded in other ways, automatically imports into similar handheld stuff, and syncs up with other inventory/storage Perks, Items, and items. If lost, stolen, or broken, it will respawn in an appropriate and safe place immediately, even during the Gauntlet.
-Craft Bench Card (50CP) This card, when installed in the Satisfactorio Builder, lets it craft any recipe that you can craft at any crafting station internally, though slower than you could at a dedicated station.
-Pattern Extension Chip (50CP) This card, when installed in the Builder, grants it the ability to create ad-hoc blueprints based on existing machines, and then fill those blueprints in. You can use it to quickly and easily extend groups of belts, or lines of machines. It will faithfully execute patterns that change as they iterate. It also allows doing multiple patterns, such as two production lines for different products and the foundations at once, even if those patterns don't line up or have different lengths."
16,,100CP,The Right Tools For The Job ,Freefall,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"Every job requires tools, be they a socket wrench, measuring tape, a hand saw, or mop. So long as it is either mundanely accessible without background checks or you already have it, you can summon a copy of any tool you need. This only applies to when you're cleaning, fixing, building, or other material-based preparation. You can't directly use it in combat and you can't use the material of the tool itself.
* In case it is not clear, free summon of any tool you own to your hand at will."
17,,100CP,The Toolkit ,Sabaton,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"When wielding this toolkit, you can repair devices most would think broken beyond salvation. You could find two twisted armor plates and a couple of treads and before you know it, you have a tank that's as good as new.
* Extremely op portable repair kit
* Arguably reality warping or influences the wielder as text gives no mention of the users own skills"
18,,100CP,Tool box ,Generic Factory,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"This Tool Box can store any number of hand held tools, and will never get too heavy to carry. Always contains a set of basic tools that can be called on without notice and in any number like hammers, saws and blowtorches. Specialized tools you will have to place inside this box ahead of time."
19,,150CP,PDA | Scanner | Upgraded scanner | Habitat Constructor ,Subnautica,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"-PDA (0CP) Loaded with an emergency intelligence and more data capacity than you could ever use, this is a survivor's second most powerful tool (after his or her brain.) The AI may get a bit . . . quirky . . . over long deployments. Your version is basically indestructible. Contains basic construction blueprints.
-Habitat Constructor (50CP) As long as the materials are present in your subspace inventory, the Habitat Constructor is capable of creating robust outposts and domiciles. Due to complex structural requirements, the constructor is unable to build anything that isn't anchored to the ground.
* ""Complex structural requirements"" implies that with sufficient technical abilities this limitation can be overcome.
-Scanner (50CP) The scanner uses the PDA artificial intelligence to analyze an object, often finding weaknesses or uses not immediately apparent to the user. If one of your fabricators is capable of constructing the scanned object, a blueprint is created. Scanning time varies with size and complexity.
-Upgraded scanner (50CP) For those who don't want to get too close to the Reaper Leviathan, but just really want that scan, this upgrade quadruples the scanning distance and speed."
20,,200CP,AR Masking Software | 'The Eye' AR Windows ,Eclipse Phase,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"-AR Masking Software (100CP) Augmented Reality software overlays your vision with realistic (or not-so-realistic) graphics, effectively changing or adding to what you see. This is normally used as a navigational aid (eg: painting a path in your vision to show the route to something) or for gaming, but you could also use it for many other purposes - for example you could give your muse a ""body"" that seems to move around the environment or fill an empty room with a simulated crowd, but of course it wouldn't be able to interact with anything. It can also edit out things you don't want to see (leaves a red outline in place for safety reasons), or place censoring over things. This version has zero lag and no advertisements, and is shared to any companions who have mesh inserts.
-'The Eye' AR Windows (100CP) These AR display windows match things in your field of vision to data from Firewall's databases, wikis, chat channels and forum posts - so if you happen to walk past a known trafficker of TITAN artifacts on the streets of Noctis, an AR window will flag them and display what The Eye knows about them. Unfortunately, The Eye is only good for things that Firewall knows about - new threats won't raise flags or have any data. In future worlds, The Eye AR windows tend to flag things in the databases or general awareness of groups with similar objectives to Firewall, but are fairly light on hard data - mostly something like ""This individual is wanted for questioning by SHIELD and is considered armed and dangerous"" or ""This carving is a sign used by Thayan spies to mark meeting spots"". You can dismiss the AR windows or keep them from appearing at any time.
* Masking software can serve as a memetic filter with decent programming.
* Windows can provide access to the information of any secretive organisation."
21,,200CP,Architect Gizmo Pack ,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A backpack full of tools that can greatly increase construction speed, and also allows the user to place and interact with objects from a fairly significant distance."
22,,200CP,Cradle ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"Weapons of war are not the only thing to advance, and this medical bed is proof of that. This human-sized medical device can heal wounds by scanning the wounded area and then regrowing skin tissue to a degree of accuracy that visually one wouldn't be able to tell there was a wound. If improved, there might be a way to let it 'grow' an entire body, but it would take a great degree of medical knowledge to sufficiently do so. There is then the issue of giving it a consciousness; it can create bodies but it cannot create life."
23,,200CP,Extraction Kit | Extraction Kit Upgrade ,Inception,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"-Extraction Kit (0CP) This machine lies at the very heart of the story, and is used to allow up to ten participants to share a dream together. It's small enough to fit into a briefcase, robust enough to operate even in harsh environments such as sub-zero temperatures or following its use as a blunt weapon,and remarkably simple to operate. Each participant is connected to the device using an IV-like injector.
-Extraction Kit Upgrade (200CP) The Extraction Kit is an ingenious little device, but it does have its limits. This upgrade allows all your Extraction Kits to automatically function in future settings, updating schematics and formulas as necessary to interface with anything sentient. Elves, aliens, potentially even A.I. and ghosts will all be readily compatible with a bit of tweaking. In addition, this variant of the Extraction Kit is easily modified, allowing you to readily improve it further by, for example, connecting it to computer databases, eliminating the need for sedatives or combining it with other methods of mental interaction such as magic or telepathic broadcasts."
24,,200CP,Faber Set ,Draka Series,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"This is a small device, about the size of your usual attache case, with flanged pans down the sides. Part of the standard gear of the Samothracian cyber-commandos of the interstellar era, this is a full set of Nano-Fabricators, ready for you to use. Put stuff in the left pan, and the faber breaks it down on the molecular level and reassembles it in the right pan. You can build anything that you have schematics for or have reverse-engineered a sample of, provided that you have sufficient raw elements to form the necessary compounds and it's something that actually can be reproduced by a non-magical molecular assembly device. This is a smaller model, so if you want to use it to build a large machine with this you'll need to build parts and assemble them manually. You do, however, also get a full-size Industrial Fabricator installed in your warehouse, ready for whatever purposes you might care to use it for."
25,,200CP,Hands Of A Fran ,Franken Fran,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"6 attachable arms that link up to your nervous system, they greatly enhance speed and multitasking, with no drop in precision or control. Become a one-man surgery team. Free bulky labcoat to conceal the arms.
* Assuming each pair symbolizes an extra mental thread, when utilized with powers from under Time, it gets rather crazy, effectively multiplying your building speed by 4."
26,,200CP,Modular Nanofabricator ,Orion's Arm: The Amalgamation,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"This coffee table sized transapient tech fabricator can manufacture many things, but at present it's limited up to S1 and a select few S2 technologies and materials. It's open for modifications and upgrades, though, and can process exotic and esoteric materials if you have them."
27,,200CP,Monkey Tool | Diagnostic Upgrade | Fabrication Upgrade ,Bloons,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"-Monkey Tool (100CP) A powerful multi tool, with unfoldable attachments to manipulate any screw or sprocket. Has a hefty hammer head on one end as well.
-Diagnostic Upgrade (50CP) New attachments allow you to scan items, learning what they are made of, how damaged they are, and other information.
-Fabrication Upgrade (50CP) New attachments are designed for shaping materials into new shapes, bending, cutting, welding, and more."
28,,200CP,Omnitool | Scanner ,Mass Effect Andromeda,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"-Omnitool (100CP) You get an omni-tool loaded up with programs and information that'd be best suited for unsupported colonization in a new galaxy. Because the Andromeda Initiative knew that they'd be going with a finite supply of ammo, medi-gel and power cells, each omni-tool can recover and repurpose appropriate resources to serve appropriate functions. For example, liquid coolant allows weapon heatsinks to be reused, and organic compounds can be refined into medi-gel. They can also convert consumable items into immediately usable forms. Finally, they do everything else regular omni-tools can: Communication, manufacturing fabricator, sensor analysis, and computer mainframe.
-Scanner (100CP) This omni-tool mounted system is how the Andromeda Initiative plans to rapidly survey planets. This system is a fast and accurate sampling system that is formally known as Panoptes. When linked to an AI, it can produce multiple analyses and predictive models in seconds, turning what would be the surveying work of weeks into mere moments. For most purposes it uses a transmitted accelerator mass spectrometer to create a snapshot of an objects components, atomic weight, and radioactivity, allowing for in-depth analysis. For biological materials, the system switches to an electrospray ionization system, so that plants or animals can be scanned without causing radiation damage. For a Jumper, you no longer need to have an AI linked to the system for it to work, though that would help. You can also take DNA scans of organisms for further study, and scan devices to help you figure out what they do, and maybe later reproduce them. Lastly, if you have a longer ranged sensor system, you could link the Scanner to that to scan further away, even if being in the Scanner's original range would get you clearer results."
29,,200CP,One-Stop Crafting Station ,Starbound,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A single large workbench that can reconfigure its surface and toolset to handle all of your crafting needs. As long as you provide the ingredients and recipes / blueprints, you can use this crafting station to construct anything you want. Note that while you could use this to help you build all the pieces of a starship or skyscraper, you'd still have to put all those pieces together yourself."
30,,200CP,PSYCHOSCOPE ,PREY,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"The Psychoscope is an advanced scanning tool developed by Morgan Yu to gather information about the Typhon. It is able to provide an experienced user specialised information about the aliens which can be used to develop new Neuromods. The device was built around the Typhon, though can be used on humans and robots. It will require an update if you want to use it to scan a new biologist, which can be built with the right skills. A Psychoscope can support 8 chipsets at a time, not including its core scanning hardware and has a stock range of about 10 meters."
31,,200CP,Scanner ,Iji,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"Serves a number of purposes. Primarily, allows you to determine the location of all living creatures within a large radius around the user, although this might be blocked by certain defenses or stealth abilities. Also capable of determining molecular structure and provides blueprints when scanning objects.
* Can detect living things at large range and get molecular structure and blueprints for objects. Is portable."
32,,200CP,TRANSTAR SUIT - ARTX EVA SUITE UPGRADE ,PREY,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"The TranStar suit is a multipurpose uniform that is designed to quickly and easily interface with an EVA system and utilise touch screens through the gloves. Volunteers are given a green suit and will not be trusted by the rest of the staff. Security is given a while and black suit, science a blue and black suit, Engineering an orange and black suit, and executive staff a red and black suit. Even in its basic state the suit gives a small amount of protection against environmental hazards and physical attacks along with a flashlight. The suit can take up to 8 additional chipsets, expanding it's capabilities."
33,,200CP,Utility Mods ,Dead Space,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"Ah, technology, the best part of the future. The Kinesis Module projects an artificial gravity field from an emitter pad on the palm of the hand it's mounted on. Much like the name might imply, this field allows you to lift objects; smaller objects hover about a foot in front of your palm, whereas larger objects, most of which must be specifically modified to work with it and are typically on tracks or rails, move as close to you as they are able. You can manipulate these objects with your hand, and even throw them with a surprising amount of force, enough to penetrate a body with a bone spike and nail it to a steel wall. Stasis, on the other hand, as its name might imply, creates a temporal stasis field of a certain volume around the targeted object. It affects both organic and inorganic material, including living creatures, and has no problem with irregularly-shaped objects, flowing out around the targeted object.
* Allows for the movement of objects remotely as well as freeze them in place while working on them."
34,,200CP,Warehouse Roboport ,Factorio,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A tablet that always returns to you after being lost or destroyed controls a small fleet of robots that fly out of a hatch in the cosmic warehouse's ceiling. These drones can move small items and will work together to carry up to a ton at a time, and have tools that allow for simple constructions to be performed, if you provide the system with digital blueprints. The drones can range a kilometer from the door to the cosmic warehouse, but can link up with constructed roboports to extend their range. The robots vanish if the warehouse door closes. The robots can draw from both normal and warehouse versions of the provider chests. You start with a single normal version of the provider chest, with plans to make more. You will have to source the tools and materials to do such from elsewhere."
35,,300CP,Creature Dehydration ,Lilo and Stitch,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"Experiments are far too dangerous to keep up and active. But you have a genius solution. A machine that will dehydrate any creature placed inside it into a small orb the size of a golf ball. To have the creature return to its original form, it is required only to touch the orb with a drop of water. Better not lose these anywhere wet."
36,,300CP,Digital Storage System ,Infinite Stratos,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A small remote control that links to a storage of digitised matter, this allows one to store and instantly summon with a click of a button a great array of materials or objects. The remote is able to store up to several IS frames at a time at maximum, though there is no particular limit on it only storing IS frames. If you want to pack it full of missiles or bombs, it could make a deadly surprise weapon."
37,,300CP,Modular Armor ,Factorio,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"An armored and environmentally sealed suit, designed to keep the wearer alive in a wide variety of alien environments. On-board recycling systems handle waste, keep the internals clean, and produce clean water along with a nutritious if tasteless paste to feed the wearer. Occasional top-offs with fresh water and biomass will be required. But the main draw of this armor is the extremely robust power system and programming suite that can quickly install and adapt to new attachments, integrating them into existing systems and adjusting them to best suit the wearer. Comes with a portable fusion reactor, battery array, strength- and speed-boosting exoskeleton, and night vision attachments pre-installed. You may import another suit of armor you own to gain these qualities."
38,,300CP,Neural Plugs | VR Construct Hub ,The Matrix,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"-Neural Plugs (100CP) Humans are no longer born outside of Zion. They are grown, and the plugs upon your body are a mark of shame... as well as a mark of pride, for turning the tools of the Machines against them. A plug on the base of your skull, along with plugs in various places on your body, will allow you to inject things into yourself and connect plugs much more efficiently than stabbing yourself, as well as giving you an 'in' to the Matrix. For an additional 50CP, you can also be given a 'neural rig' chair set-up, allowing one to connect to the Matrix and its related functions without a plug. Interesting how wireless can offer so many options.
-VR Construct Hub (200CP) Sometimes all you need is just a way to get things in order... or visualize it, if need be. This machine system is a virtual workspace or ""loading program"" created to run simulations or upload virtual objects inside a computer-generated reality, allowing you to essentially world-build or train someone. Of course there's a limit to what you can do, with processing power and the energy required to maintain it... but I'm sure if you hooked it up to the right machines, you could say, have people controlling a city's defense grid inside a white room. Or generate places to hone one's skills. ...just don't do anything too bad with this? Please?"
39,,300CP,STC Converter ,Warhammer 40k: Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"This tome-sized cogitator is designed to be fed blueprints for alien or out-of-jump technology and convert them to use STC-standard parts and design principles, well-known for being extremely robust. Perfect translation and equal functionality is not guaranteed, while technology that relies on unique materials or scientific principles not native to the 40k setting will most likely be impossible to recreate. The blueprints that result from successful conversions can be followed by any competent tech-priest. Running blueprints for Magitech or psionic technology through this device without a supreme understanding of 40k metaphysics is an exceedingly bad idea."
40,,400CP,C Cube ,Artemis Fowl,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"Ah. Yes, this. This is a curious little thing, especially since it's not supposed to exist yet when you enter the jump. But you have it anyway. This is a small cube, of a colour of your choice, with a pop-out keyboard and screen that open on command. This is, well, the be all and end all of computer technology, in one little package. It can interface with any electronic or digital data storage or communication medium, any phone or computer, simply by being in their proximity, or in the proximity of any device connected to them via a network. It can even interface with radio waves and similar transmissions, or 'surveillance beams'. It has unlimited storage and obscene processing power, being able to access, hack and control any and all computer systems, no matter how advanced, in seconds at the very most. It can break any code, and download any amount of data, all in moments. Any data acquired can be 'compensated', bringing spotty videos to 4k quality and shitty audio to the finest surround sound you can imagine, the same applicable for other forms of data.
It can function as a phone, computer and TV, including presenting itself as different devices if it's had a chance to 'download' them. It could tell if you were being observed by a satellite, and the registration number and owners of the sat too.
It's indestructible, and comes with an inviolable connection to the internet. All of them, in fact. The internet for every world you've been to and go to hereafter, listed side by side. Though every connection other than the one to your current world is one-way only, meaning you can read and watch and download all you want, but can't send anything back."
41,,400CP,Cracked Desktop CM ,Eclipse Phase,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A desktop cornucopia machine, about the size of a large photocopier, with all safety and copyright limiters removed. It can make almost anything you have the blueprints and correct feedstock for. It can't make antimatter or anything that requires nanotech more advanced than this setting has. If you are trying to make something bigger than the CM itself, you may need it to print smaller parts you then assemble.
* The best nanotech of the setting can go up to femtotech and picotech"
42,,400CP,Lighter ,Hive Queen Quest,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"Given to the Red Queen by the Great Lee owning this lighter greatly enhances the rate at which you research foreign technology, and can also start fires. Includes a small chain to hang it around your neck. Fits all sizes."
43,,400CP,Promethean Hacking Apps ,Eclipse Phase,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A collection of dizzyingly advanced software tools that can turn an average Joe or an AI into a reasonable hacker, and give an excellent hacker the chance to beat a TITAN at their own game assuming a level playing field, of course. Not even this software will out-hack a TITAN if your hardware, connection and mental speed are lacking.
* TITANS are unchained exponentially upgrading AIs
* A 'reasonable hacker' is in terms of the far flung future when network security AIs are a thing and people are extremely paranoid about network security because quite a lot of people live digitally."
44,,400CP,Silver Wonder ,Digimon World Re: Digitize,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"A unique tablet capable of functioning just fine wherever you take it; be it in a digital world or a realm between dimensions. Aside from effectively being an entire computer engineering workshop in the palm of your hand, and possessing an unlimited internet connection; this technological marvel is capable of actively manipulating the data in digital worlds in the hands of a sufficiently skilled and knowledgeable user, allowing them to bring their digital dreams to life. Moreover, it has exceptional sensor arrays for its size; allowing it to scan an island sized region for all sorts of energy signatures and disturbances once properly programmed, or even analyze ongoing phenomenon.
* Given that the digital world is essentially another dimension this item essentially allows for indirect reality warping."
45,,400CP,The Seed ,Sword Art Online SB,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"You've come across something quite impressive here Jumper, the culmination of Akihiko Kayaba's work and something that can revolutionise the world if properly applied. The most basic and obvious use of this is as a development kit a preset series of program packages and media resources that can be used for creating Virtual Reality worlds, as well as control the input and output of the five senses of players, provided they're wearing the NerveGear or a device based off it.The second element contained within is the famed Cardinal System, an AI developed to manage the entire system of Sword Art Online, providing balancing to enemy encounters and patching bugs based off what the players encounter and do during play. Why, it can even provide mental care through the Mental Health Counseling Programs it has as part of its sub-system, helping to ensure players are happy and mentally healthy as they play through the game. Cardinal was also famed for creating content whole-cloth without any human input, scouring the internet to craft quests or enemies based off mythology; if you wanted to you could be a one-man game developer for something rivaling a AAA title in content and quality. With study and effort it's possible to replicate Cardinal and the mental health programs, crafting new AI on the same level as the Mental Health Counseling Program within the Companions section."
46,,600CP,Analytic Tool | Objective Scanner,Generic Space Opera,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"-Analytic Tool (400CP) With a short scan, this device can reveal nearly anything about an object in question, from general structure and chemical composition, to life signs or medical problems, to general energy readings. You may import any smartphone or tablet device you already own for this option - yes, even the tablet you could gain from the Stellar Charts-item.
-Objective Scanner (200CP) The Analytic Tool greatly improves its resolution allowing for near perfect scans of sub-molecular composition, energy constructs and even more ethereal occurrences.
* Author stated in a comment on the doc that the text as written misrepresents what it was intended to be in response to a comment criticising how it was underpowered in comparison to comparably priced perks in the same doc so it is likely more powerful than the text implies."
47,,600CP,Proto-Tool ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"Proto-Tool Why carry around individual weapons and gadgets all the time? Why not just put all of them into one package? Looks like someone thought about this question long enough to invent this nifty little catch-all tool. The Proto-Tool is a highly advanced device that can change into just about any sort of weapon or bit of gear. Need a scanner? It's a scanner now. Need an energy bow? It's an energy bow. 
Fishing rod? Flashlight? Vacuum? Energy blaster? You name it, the Proto-Tool can change into it. Just about any person-sized device you can imagine, it can change into. The downside is that it has a finite battery life and will need to recharge after extensive amounts of use, and generally won't make things like a person-sized doomsday weapon without some serious upgrades.

the Iron Line",Domain: Toolkits: Mundane,"-Advanced Materials Upgrade Kit (300CP) Plasteel, adamantium, armourplas, synth-leather and other sophisticated materials are used for all sorts of purposes within the Imperium, and are typically far more resilient than their archaic equivalents. Archaic styles of armour are seldom effective against advanced weapons, and rarely used in any case, but many of those who hail from primitive cultures favour the styles of wargear they are accustomed to. Wrought from plasteel and armourplas instead of bronze, iron and steel, a suit of chain or plate can be a quite effective defence, often the equal of more modern armours.
-Lathe-Wrought Armour Plating Kit (400CP) The astronomical and gravitational alignment of the Lathe worlds creates the conditions for the production of metal alloys of rare and singular properties. Lathe armour plating is strong and light, flexible enough to withstand the most powerful blows, and even resistant to intense heat or the crackling edge of a power weapon. The cost and rarity of such an upgrade is beyond the means of most individuals, with maybe only half a dozen sets of Lathewrought armour upgrade kits constructed in a decade, each created under commission for a specific wearer."
