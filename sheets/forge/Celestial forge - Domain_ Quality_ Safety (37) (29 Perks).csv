1,,100CP,Cry Havoc ,World of Darkness - Genius The Transgression,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Mortals cause wondrous technology to go haywire, endangering lives and property. Geniuses call this unique ability of mortals to ruin their creations ""Havoc."" A wonder touched, picked up, or interacted with by a mere mortal (a being with no supernatural powers) roils with uncertainty and prolonged contact can break down even the most powerful Wonders. In addition this worsens as a mere mortal interacts with the Wonder, for to them the device makes no sense and pointing out the patches that Mania maintains is a good way to unweave them. You can now apply this inscrutability and inability to use technology beyond the kin of mere mortals to all of your technology at will, even when not in contact with the technology or if you only recently gained this power but crafted the device earlier in your carrier. This only applies if the technology would usually be inscrutable to the person in question, those who can understand the tech won't count for Havoc called in this way."
2,,100CP,Divine Rights Management ,Unsong,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Why would you ever teach a man to fish, when you could make him come begging to you for every dinner?
You have a powerful ability to build fine-tuned break-down and failure conditions into just about anything you create, weaving them inextricably into your designs; your creations can be hobbled so irrevocably that they cannot be made whole without also negating the principles that make them function. Only a genius far greater from your own could free what you have limited."
3,,100CP,DNA Lock On ,Lilo and Stitch,Domain: Quality: Safety,"You're tired of pesky law enforcement personnel sneaking into your lab. To combat this you have created DNA lock on technology, allowing your machines to target specific creatures, and only them. Of course, this will require collecting their DNA first. You have put this to good use with inventions like your door that only opens for you, and the auto-turret that will refuse to fire if you're standing in the way."
4,,100CP,Guarding the Ark ,Lords of the Night - Vampire,Domain: Quality: Safety,"A common important duty for many angels is guarding holy sites and items, for such things can be dangerous to the faithful, and targets of the iniquitous. Perhaps you held such duties in the past? How can you know. This trick hints at such a history You have freed a splinter of your true essence from your incarnate form and may invest it in an object you currently control - you don't need to be the owner, but it can't currently be contested - you could use it on a stolen sword, but not one someone is trying to wrestle out of your hands. Once invested, it will stay so unless the object is exorcised, or you call back your splinter.
While invested, you count as possessing the object, and as acting as a Watcher, being able to see and sense what goes on around it. You may also start acting as an Controller, Corrupter, and Enhancer when and as you wish. Basically, you can sense what goes on around your object, you may animate moving parts (make a crossbow load itself, make a wagon roll), may curse those who use your object in a way you don't want, and may make it act like a magical item whose strength depends on your strength. These roles are laid out in The Book of Vile Darkness. This perk may be bought more then once. Each time it's bought, you rip free another splinter to invest. Only the first purchase is free from The Lost, but they may buy more at discount."
5,,100CP,Hands Off! ,Starcraft II - Nova Covert Ops,Domain: Quality: Safety,"When one is at the forefront of technological development, one sometimes has to watch out for espionage. Why bother developing a revolutionary new weapon system when a Ghost with sticky fingers walks in and takes it? You are able to design, and seamlessly implement security protocols into any technology or equipment you have access to that would limit use to only authorized personnel. You don't even have to go to the extreme of half-breaking it either, that's for neanderthals and inferior scientists."
6,,100CP,"My Creations, My Children ",Heaven's Lost Property,Domain: Quality: Safety,"The Angelroids and other constructs you make are not mere drones or robots - they are, each and every one, your own child. Whether or not you consider that true or care for them at all, your creations with any degree of intelligence or sentience will look to you as a mentor or parental figure, or just a dear friend when you first activate them. Regardless of its nature, they will enter this world with a degree of loyalty towards you, their creator. You know how to maintain this through care or the right mix of discipline and caretaking. This, incidentally, makes you pretty good at actual parenting as well."
7,,100CP,Ruinous Font ,Mistborn,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Hemalurgy is a dangerous and dark art, with a natural connection to the god of Destruction, Ruin. Through this connection, Ruin can manipulate the beneficiaries of Hemalurgy towards his own destructive ends. With this perk, you gain the tiniest sliver of Ruin's power just enough to fuel your own Hemalurgy without Ruin's help. Hemalurgic spikes you create have no connection to Ruin, and their users cannot be controlled by him or by emotional Allomancy. You can also make Hemalurgic spikes outside of this Jump. This does not confer any knowledge or ability with Hemalurgy you'll either have to take another perk, or find someone who can teach you. Unfortunately, the only people who can teach you are more likely to kill you instead."
8,,200CP,Black Boxing ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,Domain: Quality: Safety,"While certain red-robed rats of Mars always trying to get their grubby mechadendrites on your stuff is annoying, messing with them is endlessly entertaining. You can easily tweak your work to be nearly impossible for others to duplicate. If you're feeling particularly spiteful, you can build in some cross-connections so anyone trying will blow themselves up."
9,,200CP,Father ,Blade Runner 2049,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Your children are very precious but not irreplaceable. It's something they remember well when they look at you and see a God. Anything you have created, from natural means or artificially, sees you as a God if you wish it. It can be as a terrifying, wrathful and strict God or as a benevolent, loving and protective God if you desire but they will find your superiority and position to be undeniable. This is not an unbreakable belief but it is strongly held, with enough proof to the otherwise your creations may be convinced that you are not as deserving of such terrified obedience or worshipful devotion. But proving that you are worthy shouldn't be too hard."
10,,200CP,Fumble Spotter ,Generic Cubicle,Domain: Quality: Safety,"You excel at finding odd ways in which your products might be used or misused that could lead them to fail, and in devising ways to fix them before they ever become issues. You are also adept at making the proper usage for your products obvious in their design."
11,,200CP,Jumper Technology Activation ,Stargate Atlantis,Domain: Quality: Safety,"This isn't so much an item as an upgrade for any item that you've bought with CP or personally made; its user interface will now only work for you and those (if any) you specify. You can change the lock on an affected device just by giving it new orders, but for any given individual this access is all or nothing. The upgrade will also prevent the interface from being bypassed unless it is physically removed, replaced or destroyed.
* 200CP is for a la carte"
12,,200CP,Precision Tools ,MtG - New Phyrexia,Domain: Quality: Safety,"The exarchs, elite of the Core Augurs creations, managed to create a thought field specifically attuned to the Mirran resistances minds, disabling their will. While you might not be as versed in the neuroscience involved(yet), you have found a way to attune your creations to a certain group of targets' ' ensuring they will not damage your own allies. This also lets you make your own creations useless against you, ensuring they wont be used to fight you not for long, anyways."
13,,200CP,Tenebrium Basics ,Divinity - Original Sin,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Tenebrium is an odd mineral. It grows like a crystal, but can be melted and forged like iron. It is easily enchanted, but highly resistant to other kinds of magic. In addition, it is highly dangerous and inflicts a disease known simply as Rot upon all those who handle it in any form. Worst of all, Rot cannot be cured by simple magical spells, requiring rare and powerful artifacts to cleanse the infected. Most cannot afford such things and slowly wither over the months following handling a single chunk of crystal. But with this perk, you have come to understand how to safely handle Tenebrium without infecting yourself."
14,,200CP,Voice Activation & Palm Locks | Lethal Mode ,Dredd,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Voice Activation & Palm Locks (100CP) Applies voice activation and palm lock features to any or all items of technology you own, installing it on existing items and automatically installing on new items as desired. In default mode, the DNA locks simply cause the item to not function for unauthorised users can't have someone blowing up your stuff just for trying to take it for a test drive, right? Voice activated items still can't do anything they don't already do. You could tell an M16 safety off, but telling it to use hotshot when it doesn't have the ability to change ammo types won't work, for example. This does not apply to purely magical items.
Lethal Mode (100CP) Even more of a deterrent, this purchase allows you to set a self destruct mode when an ID check is failed. The object will detonate with force in proportion to its size; something carryable in one hand would blow off a person's arm, whereas a car would probably explode with enough force to kill a crowd surrounding it."
15,,300CP,Fantasian ,Sorcerer's Apprentice,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Unlike a certain mouse, you maintain impeccable control over any animated objects you create. While it's not like they're truly incapable of overdoing tasks you set, they'll definitely check in with you before doing anything drastic. Constructs with animal intelligence will also quickly and correctly interpret any hand signals you attempt to send, no matter how clumsy. This has some reverse application to non magical applications, like machinery."
16,,300CP,Goo-ery ,Eureka-Warehouse 13-alphas,Domain: Quality: Safety,"This large, bulky, steam powered system is used to produce Neutraliser, a viscous purple goo that is used to render Artefacts inert - at least temporarily. Hooked into the Warehouse system, it supplies a steady stream of Neutraliser throughout the building as part of an automated and manual controlled emergency application system, with spray hoses available in each section. Integrates with your warehouse, located in the basement, requires water and electricity supply. Warning: don't eat the goo, you'll... see things. Topical application may cause uncontrollable dizziness and laughter."
17,,300CP,Qu-it It,Irredeemable/Incorruptible,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Your understanding of the technology that you have created or understood to the point where you can consider it 'yours' is so great that you find it almost trivial to come up with methods to use that understanding to deny the benefits of that technology to others who have either appropriated it or developed in parallel. Your understanding of your own created teleportation technology may be so great you can destroy an entire galaxy spanning network of teleporters based on your tech all with the push of a button. However you cannot do this for technology in the hands of those who were the source of the technology, no matter how well you understand it or feel possessive of it, not by the means of this perk at any rate."
18,,300CP,Shaping Gloves ,Geneforge,Domain: Quality: Safety,"This pair of carefully crafted gloves allows one to work with powerful or specially modified essence without the typical risks of horrible mutilation, mutation, and death. Usually such gloves are crafted for a specific purpose, these aren't, they seem to work with anything, even Geneforges."
19,,400CP,Deep-Layer Protocols ,Crysis,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Technology in your possession is unique in the manner that it is incapable of deviation from your stated goals. Normally, nanomachines detached from the collective whole would run the risk of having their original goals corrupted or subverted without the greater collective to issue orders, but technology held by you can be proofed so such errors are self-correcting. The only way to remove your tech from play is to destroy or disable it. Hacking or other 'tricks' short of a full rewrite by someone who knows what they're doing will not work."
20,,400CP,Fetishist ,World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse,Domain: Quality: Safety,"When using Gifts or other kinds of magic to Bind a spirit or creature either in place or into a receptacle, it is far harder for the target to resist. Once bound, it is impossible for them to escape without outside help."
21,,400CP,Laz'r'us Nannies ,Schlock Mercenary Rebuild,Domain: Quality: Safety,"A set of nanites that, when implanted in an individual, will slow their aging to effectively nothing and back up their mind within their skin and other organs, and which can work to regenerate them and revive them, allowing an individual to revive from anything outside of majority body disintegration. And if the nanites are linked to a strong enough computer system, they can upload a copy of the user's mind periodically, which can then be loaded into a cloned body. Comes with a device for creating more, and implanted nannies will adapt to new biologies automatically."
22,,400CP,Secrecy is the Key to Diabolical Success ,Donkey Kong Country,Domain: Quality: Safety,"It is critical that top-secret projects remain top secret, even from the people working on it. You are able to ensure that everyone carrying out a secret plan or project you have devised remain completely ignorant of what they are doing/making, without hindering their ability to carry out the plan. For instance, you could have each individual soldier make a single part in his spare time and have your general assemble them together in pitch darkness without peeking, and the secret superweapon will be constructed just as according to plan. That said, it won't work if you need to tell people what the plan is, and sometimes it's a good idea to let your allies know what's up before they reach (wrong) conclusions of their own."
23,,400CP,That's Just Asking For Trouble ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Quality: Safety,"When you make advanced technology far beyond what the locals are used to, it tends to make waves. Maybe your little DNA database is actually one of the greatest weapons ever created or an attempt to prove you can harness the fundamental forces of the universe ends up destroying a planet. The good news is you're not stupid it's the Genius tree, not the Drooling Idiot tree! You have excellent insight into the moral implications and long-term effects of your inventions if they were used by others or made commonly available, especially when it would be a purely bad idea. Also, just to make sure nobody steals or misuses it, any sort of failsafe you make to keep it from being abused is unable to be hacked or bypassed...if you made a device that works only for a certain person, no amount of hacking or DNA swapping will make someone else pass off as that person. If you need two keys to unlock a certain feature, you bet only those two keys will work. This goes both ways all your devices will come with a backdoor for you to take back control if someone does misuse it, and it will always succeed. Enjoy the look on the face of a wannabe thief when the superweapon they stole from you just shuts down in their hand."
24,,500CP,Cincotrix ,Ben 10,Domain: Quality: Safety,"The Mark 5 Nanoshift Enabled Exo-Armor is a powerful Techadon weapon in the shape of a wristband. When activated it becomes a nearly indestructible suit of armor armed to the teeth with a vast arsenal of ranged weaponry. It can also grow a thruster back to allow flight, wheels for high-speed acceleration on land, and a face mask to allow you to survive in oxygen-less environments."
25,,500CP,Smart Immunity ,Limitless,Domain: Quality: Safety,"You've had one hit of NZT in the past week, and it seems like you'll never come down. Well, you actually won't, not if you don't want to, that is. You may choose for up to 10 drugs, magical spells, buffs, or similar time-limited boosts that are affecting you to last indefinitely without any of their unwanted side effects. Additionally, you may choose to end any effect (not just the ones maintained by this perk) whenever you want, either through conscious choice or automatically (it is called Smart Immunity for a reason) if you somehow can't but would have if you could. If you already have 10 effects being maintained by this and want to add another, you'll have to allow one of the ones you're maintaining to lapse. You may also extend the duration of any temporary effect by a factor of ten, based on its full duration when applied, but these effects keep their side effects. When you drop an effect from its slot it will continue with any of its original duration it has left. Additionally you may reapply any effect that you have lost if the time since you lost it isn't greater than twice (after adding the potential 10* extension) the duration it offers. Capstone Booster"
26,,600CP,A Creator's Love ,Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings,Domain: Quality: Safety,"They underestimate the love you put into what you create. The pride of a Necrotect, a true Necrotect, is not just in his own skill but also in the wellbeing of his own creations. For you to awaken and see that the tomb that you built and were buried in still stands, unbroken despite the many centuries of abuse it has suffered, how could you possibly not feel the love of a parent for how long your creations stood tall. For some Necrotects, their creations begin to respond in kind, moving to their will to serve their creator-parents. You may command and control any such construct you have designed and crafted or overseen the construction of as the head of the team. The stone of your tomb bows to your will, blocks shuffling and rolling about to create new configurations. Swords that you craft sharpen or lose their edge at your command or even turn upon their wielders. In your presence, your constructions will even repair themselves from damage, healing as if they were truly alive."
27,,600CP,Corruption of Good! ,Dungeon Keeper Ami,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Who says corruption has to be a bad thing? If used in the correct way even the powers of darkness can be powerful weapons in the arsenal of the light. Through prayer and ritual you can turn even the darkest of artifacts to the side of good, channeling the lights power instead of the accursed darkness, as an outgrowth of this you can also ""corrupt"" or otherwise turn beings of evil into being good and following the path of the light given time and effort even the darkest of creatures can be made to see the light."
28,,600CP,GitD Virus 2.0 ,Freefall,Domain: Quality: Safety,"With this you have a selective killer. Before unleashing the program somewhere that it can access the offending AIs, you may designate parameters as to which to ignore, harmlessly disable, selectively damage, and which to utterly destroy. This item's effects start out as strong as the canonic virus, but scale up the greater your abilities, hardware used, knowledge of software, and knowledge of target."
29,,600CP,Three Laws of Robotics ,SB Dragonball Z,Domain: Quality: Safety,"Isn't it annoying when those teenagers you kidnapped and subjected to brutal experiments against their will decide to kill you when free? Well no more, because everything you create, birth, or modify is simply incapable of betraying or harming you. While this only applies to creations which can think, you'll never have to worry about them working against your orders, in both wording and spirit. You may choose whether or not this applies to whatever creation you make."
