Comes with a small paint can that can change to different colored infinite paint, both indoor and outdoor options, never dries out if left open, and doesn't get contaminated by dirt or other colors left on the brush. Chalk, pencils, and crayons won't break, require sharpening, or be used up. Drawing pages or canvas can be changed to other types and will never run out with the finished picture being saved to your folder, and brushes will never degrade or get bent, broken bristles nor run out if they're lost or pulled.
The brushes come in a range of sizes from the wide indoor wall painter to the tiniest canvas detailer. Pencils, crayons, and chalk are much the same as are the colored varieties. A pack of special white erasers are included, ranging from small to large, that don't wear down or spread the erased material but can nevertheless undo any of your drawn or painted projects if necessary. The case and all its inventory can be found in your warehouse if lost, stolen, or destroyed."

4,,100CP,Carving kit ,Diablo 1&2,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"The tools within this leather satchel are of exceptional quality and have been ritually prepared for work with delicate magical reagents. Having these will make Gemcutting and runecarving much easier. A sheaf of paper in a waterproof scroll case notes useful details on several basic runes and the most common semi-precious gems, but it lacks details on multi-rune sequences and the rarest stones. Still, the papers make a good reference, and they will automatically update themselves when you discover new information through experimentation or research. If lost or destroyed, the kit will reappear in your possession the next day"
5,,100CP,Crafting Table ,Minecraft,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"You can easily assemble a few planks into a crafting table, upon which you can, nigh instantly, produce almost anything, so long as you have all the parts and know the recipe. Items larger than a 1m3 cube, or which are not designed to be worn on your person or carried in your hand, may require more advanced crafting techniques, but you'll still find it easier to make the parts for it. Complex items usually require a bunch of subparts, and figuring out all the recipes for them can be difficult."
6,,100CP,Etching Pen ,A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"A specialized etching tool that can carve stone, wood, metal, or other hardened surfaces like a hot knife through butter or switch to a regular pen that can write on any softer surfaces such as rice paper.

10,,100CP,Unique Uniques ,Modded Skyrim,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"You know, is there really a point to making haxcalibur if it looks the same as any other broadsword? That's just a waste.

12,,200CP,Enchanting Board ,Scooby Gamers,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"You have a certified enchanting board. Not only does it allow multiple people to pool their mana in order to fuel the enchanting process, every person that donates mana to the project also gains the same amount of 'experience' as the person doing the enchanting. Enchantments made to things using this board are guaranteed to be more effective than they would be with a normal enchanting board."
13,,200CP,Golden Sickle ,Asterix the Gaul,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"This is a sickle made of solid gold, perfect for harvesting materials with magical properties. So perfect, that it has properties of its own. Firstly, any materials harvested using this sickle will never go bad. Food doesn't rot, meat, if you somehow used it on that, doesn't go rancid, magical herbs don't lose their powers. Secondly, it tends to have the exact magical properties you need to harvest any and all magical substances, without too much of a fuss. In essence, you can replace any and all growing and harvesting requirements for an ingredient, like 'needs to see the moon twenty times', or 'dance naked under at 
twilight carrying a pitcher of water that you then sprinkle' with 'cut using this sickle'. Doesn't apply on the super rare, absolutely one-of-a-kind stuff, mind you. It must be at least somewhat common."
14,,200CP,Precision Tools ,God Catching Alchemy Meister,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"Exactly what it says on the tin. A collection of the best tools used to perform the local Alchemy. From chisels to mixing sets and other useful trinkets.

Each a perfect instrument to tattoo the body, these needles provide a potent tool for the use of body decorations. Making even the most elegant and complex patterns and designs easy to apply for the one who uses these, as they innately correct even the slightest mistake their user makes.

Along with the needles themselves, you will also receive a supply of many different mundane inks of exceptional quality. Though of course the needles can also be used with various other inks you might be able to acquire. They can handle anything, from the mundane ones to sorcerous inks to tattoo occult sigils, to chalcanth used to create living demon-ink tattoos, to stranger substances still, and even the moonsilver ink used to create the Moonsilver Tattoos and various tattoo artifacts. That last one in particular resonates with the Silver Needles, for when they are used with moonsilver ink, they may cause the Moonsilver Tattoos to become temporarily fluid and accept new tattoo artifacts to be inscribed upon the skin of their wearer.
* For mundane and magic tattoo crafting at any level"
16,,200CP,Tool Kit ,Haroun and the Sea of Stories,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"A special toolkit essential for any Water Genie. While the items may look like standard tools at a distance in the dark, a close look reveals that each is more fluid than solid, being made up of thousands of little liquid veins somehow held together by an invisible force. The various tools can scan, link, and disconnect story water streams and other dream facets, not only within the dream world but also at the border of the real world. And since the tools are actually liquids, they could be potentially be used to fiddle with other sorts of liquids. The tools often have multiple functions, such as an emergency transponder."
17,,200CP,Wiring Gear ,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"A set of wrenches and a few hundred feet of wire that can be used to connect various switches, pressure plates, and buttons to objects to control them or direct power to them.

For an undiscounted extra 100 CP (Included in above cost), this also comes with instructions on how to make teleporters, which can be wired together to transport whatever is on them between each other when activated."
18,,250CP,Revitalizing Kitchen Knives ,Toriko,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"A special type of knives required to perform the Dark Technique, forged using organisms with regenerative function and minerals that stimulate that function; cutting an ingredient with this knife will make the cells of the ingredient become active and thus revitalizing the wound. To use this knife a near superhuman ability is needed in order to pass the knife in the gaps between cells without damaging them; if someone can use it freely an ingredient can be eaten almost infinitely by restoring it little by little; in order to complete the regeneration eating high nutritional value ingredients is needed. The use of the revitalizing kitchen knife is limited by the IGO in fear of them upsetting the circulation of food. The
knife can only help the regeneration of an ingredient or person but can't revitalize dead people or beasts."
19,,300CP,Glove of the East ,Binbougami Ga!,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"This hand of mine glows with an awesome power! It's burning gri-... oh! Sorry, wrong show. This single glove comes in any color and style, and is actually quite useful! You can channel your spiritual energies through it to help you with mundane tasks; your cooking might turn out excellent, cleaning takes less work for better results, and massages work WONDERS when you hit those points. If you channel a LOT of spiritual energy, you might even imbue items and equipment to improve them and be more receptive to your spiritual/chi powers! Heart symbol optional."
20,,300CP,Herbalists Kit ,My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,Magically collects nearby herbs and spices and stores them in a magical freshness ensuring stasis inside itself while sorting and naming them. It also includes a small instruction booklet that teaches basic herbalism. The names of the herbs and spices it collects are stored in the book.
21,,300CP,Plentiful Mouths ,Haroun and the Sea of Stories,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"A Plentimaw Fish is called such due to it having dozens of maws [i.e., mouths] all over its body. You now have the same trait, with several dozen mouths scattered across your body. They can be retracted and concealed from the view of others if you like. When exposed, you can control the many mouths individually or in unison, such that they can speak in many different voices or all as one. As a result, you could say multiple statements, songs, or spells (voice-activated ones) simultaneously. But the greatest strength of having so many mouths is the ability to mix different things together. By absorbing different things in each mouth, whether it is normal food or various stories, they will all meet in your singular 
stomach and blend together into something new, which combines the best qualities of each ingredient into something special. For instance, two different power-ups would merge as one, and three stories would link into a single narrative. You can also regurgitate the combined mixture."
22,,400CP,Armsfusion Crafter ,Aion,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"This magical machine will merge any two weapons or pieces of armor placed into it into a single weapon or piece of armor. The two items need not be weapons or armor, but they must be similar. The machine is roughly the size of a coffin. When used the items merge so that it keeps the superior properties of each without stacking old properties. For example sword A has +5 str. Sword B has +3 str as well as deals lightning damage. The resulting sword would have +5 str and lightning dmg."
23,,400CP,Horadric Cube | Horadric Malus ,Diablo 1&2,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"-Horadric Cube (200CP) A copy of an ancient artifact created by the mage clans, which was itself a copy of an even older device, this engraved cube is a potent tool of alchemy and transformation. The cube's four most common uses are to repair, refine, transmute, or dismantle items. The cube can repair broken magical items to full functionality, though you may need to add in reagents to make up for lost mass and energy. Multiple items of the same type placed inside will be consumed to create a single slightly more potent version. Items can be transmuted into other items of a different shape yet similar nature, such as 
arrows into bolts. Finally, magical items can be fragmented, enchantments and power cleanly divided between each piece, a function commonly used to store dangerous items in a more manageable form.
-Horadric Malus (200CP) An ancient and heavily-enchanted hammer, this tool was built to aid in forging magical items. In layman's terms it regulates and stabilizes magical energies, preventing small mishaps, foreign mana flows, short pauses in the enchanting process and other such problems from ruining an enchanter's work. While items produced with the aid of the Malus are only slightly more powerful, they are much more resistant to mystical tampering and corruption."
24,,400CP,Philosopher's Stone ,DC Occult,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"A perfect replica of the Philosopher's Stone, one of the Four Wonders of Alchemy. Legendary even outside of occult circles and widely sought after, the Philosopher's Stone is the ultimate goal of every alchemist to ever live. The small stone possesses the ability to alter the molecular structure of inorganic matter into other elements."
25,,400CP,SCP 914's Manual ,SCP Foundation,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"This book is kind of... stupidly thin for what it claims to be. Really, it's hard-covered and barely a quarter-inch thick, and it has, ""SCP-914,"" embossed on the front of it in gold-leaf. Opening it and flipping through it shows why it's this thin: It's probably been passed through 914 on, ""Very Fine,"" itself; you can easily turn past the seeming end of the book without any trouble. Contained in its pages are instructions for making your own instance of SCP-914 and even hooking it into your Warehouse's utilities if you have any,an explanation of what each of the settings does, in excruciating detail, how to effectively combine items, and even how to care for it and repair one if damaged. It is recommended not to put sapient creatures through it, on any of the settings, in dozens of places inside the manual, but those are obviously just recommendations."
26,,400CP,Stravhs' Whetstone ,Banner Saga,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"In the stories, The God Stravhs sold silver weapons to the other Gods so they might kill each other. This whetstone hones any weapon to perfect sharpness or functionality and makes it incredibly potent in slaying enemies supernatural or divine."
27,,400CP,The Crockpot of the Gods ,IOU,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"It might be messy, but it's a cheap way of covering up a fatal experiment. This large black pot will reconstitute the body of any once-living material placed inside it as long as it's pureed first. It's recommended that foreign objects be removed first and that only one life form be restored at once. The process takes about a day and can work even with a body reduced to ashes (adding water is advisable in this case)."
28,,600CP,Eternal Flame ,Everyone Else is a Returnee,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"An inextinguishable and living flame that can continuously grow. This flame is precious even within Heaven. The more flames and magic stones it is fed, the stronger and hotter it becomes. This flame has a high level of intelligence, akin to that of a human. This flame is extremely useful for the processing of general materials and ores as even if it cannot process them immediately, it can eventually grow to the point where it can. Additionally, as this flame grows, it may become useful in other ways. Yu Ilhan incorporated the Eternal Flame into several of his items to boost the strength of their attack."
29,,600CP,Skeleton Key ,Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"Now where did you find this Jumper? There are many who would have questions for you and many others who would attempt to take this from you by any means necessary. Within your hands is a very odd looking key, almost Dwemer in design with its bronze color, angular bit, and bulbous blue bow. Of course, it's far more than that if the earlier parts didn't clue you in, within your hands is a perfect replica in shape and ability of one of the Daedric Prince Nocturnal's artifacts, the Skeleton Key, a key with the ability to unlock or lock any lock. Doors, chests, etc all yield to it and no treasure is safe so long as you 
can get to where it's stored with this. Of course, that's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the key, it's abilities lie in the locking and unlocking of just about anything, physical or not. You could unlock or lock away someone's potential for magic or war, or if it suited you, lock a portal to oblivion and undo it later with ease. So long as it can in theory be seen as something that could be locked or unlocked then this key can interact with it, with Jump docs being the exception alongside related things. As a final note the key is a part of you like Nocturnal's is a part of her, should it be lost or you give it to someone it can 
be retrieved at your leisure.
* Unlock the potential of your tech, unlock code, unlock potential for magic, unlock your tech knowledge, unlock enchanting etc etc etc. Its conceptual, as long as you can word it right you can unlock anything."
30,,600CP,The Black Cauldron ,A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"Yes, that one but a much more user friendly version. A magical indestructible cauldron in which any potion can be brewed to perfection even if the actual results produce a failed solution. With this you'll have no need for silver, gold, brass, or any other type of metal made pot to create your elixirs in and it can be set to produce an infinite amount of whatever potion is made in it until you require another. The cauldron will also eat any sludge left over so that the inside is clean when you next need to use it. The cauldron will produce an undead army on command with the proper chant or revive one person per year to full life and health.

The tools are self maintaining and the ingredients self replenishing. A set of fifteen unbreakable empty vials are included which when filled with a potion of your choice will continue to produce that potion ex nihilo, so pick your choices with care. Finally, the whole ensemble can be found in the warehouse if lost or stolen. Includes A small case with a compartment that has a replenishing store of a range of potion regents. Such regents replenish once 
every two weeks and come in reasonable quantities. Does not contain any extremely rare ingredients."
31,,600CP,"The Mixing Cauldron | Melting Pot | Spirit Pyroxene | Goldberg Formula | Daisy Chain | The 
Vortex ",Atelier: Arland Trilogy,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"-The Mixing Cauldron (100CP) Every Alchemists' trusty tool, the mixing cauldron, is basically the alchemist's work desk and research station combined into one. With this, no potion is out of reach though it isn't uncommon to find that some alchemists' will create...other things from their cauldrons, and one would be foolish to presume that a cauldron can't be improved...
-Melting pot (100CP) It's not uncommon to find that certain ingredients will not mix well just as attempting to stack too many enchantments into a potion can prove disastrous. In an attempt to mitigate this, the melting pot was constructed with a higher rate of mixing. This directly translates to a higher degree of homogenization, but you'll have to understand that to maintain this level of mixing you need to have a higher energy source than just a fire under the cauldron. It does allow you to blend some ingredients that normally would not mix however, though the results may still not be as optimal as you would hope.
-Spirit Pyroxene (100CP) No one quite knows where this pyroxene came from, but it has a very definitive effect on the items that it forms a component of. The mystical power inside the pyroxene seems to carry over into the items that it forms at least a portion of the power does, and the crafted items became more conductive towards spiritual magic of a large variety.
-Goldberg Formula (100CP) There are times when making things overly complex can be problematic. Then there are times when making things overly complex can be outright awesome. Your cauldron really shouldn't be called a cauldron anymore. Synthesis isn't a matter of tossing in ingredients and brewing. Your cauldron is a part of a system, a large chain of components and contraptions which ultimately will create a potion likely of higher quality. But you'll likely have no clue how it works. Due to the nature of this set up, you'll find that the cauldron will follow along with you in a containment chamber of its own and though it initially resembles a cottage...should the contraption chain grow bigger (and it will!) the cottage will also increase in size.
-Daisy Chain (100CP) Interested in large scale alchemy? Well, between this and a core reactor, you'll have yourself a veritable alchemy workshop. Granted, in reality this just sets up a series of mini cauldrons which will automatically adopt specific arrangements to facilitate more complex, multi-tiered synthesis reactions but it'll boost your synthesis rates immensely, and ensure that easier recipes won't fail! Of course...you could have each cauldron act autonomously but really they work best in unison with every other unit. Due to the number of cauldrons created, a large part of the containment chamber is occupied by cauldrons as they move about and get down to business. Thankfully, you can still move about and organize the cauldrons though they're a fair bit more autonomous than before. Each cauldron seems to exhibit the same effects as your original cauldron, and it isn't out of the realm of possibility to add more cauldrons though it'll be a time consuming process.
-The Vortex (100CP) The amount of energy required to keep this going will be tremendous, but if you toss anything into there it will blend. Instead of functioning like a batch system, the Cauldron operates continually, and will actively remember the last effect from the last ingredient which was put in. It's also possible for it to store an effect, but this requires you to have a constant supply of the reagent necessary to provide that effect. A cauldron useful for expert alchemists, one should take care if this is combined with any other extensive modifications."
32,,800CP,Stone Censer of Reunion ,Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse,Domain: Toolkits: Magical,"The original Stone Censer of Reunion was a potent artifact, however this version has been fine tuned to the extreme. Its first effect is that those in the range of its incense enter a state of enlightenment equal to those random moments and epiphanies, except for however long the incense lasts. Which is now forever, meaning it may even be used in a space-time acceleration treasure.
* Unlimited enlightenment and epiphanies scaling to on your int, knowledge and power"
