1,,100CP,Shadow Clones,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Domain: Databases: Magical,"Ah, shadow clone no jutsu. The signature jutsu of the Naruto franchise. And now you can join in on the fun. You have a copy of a technique scroll for the shadow clone jutsu, of such quality that an idiot could teach himself from this thing in virtually no time at all. It even has safeguards built-in that eliminate any possibility of killing yourself by putting too much chakra into it, or getting a headache from too many clones dispelling at once or anything like that. The worst that can possibly happen is that it fails to work. You still can only make as many shadow clones as your chakra can support but outside of that you can feel free to abuse this handy jutsu for training, decoys, diversions, paperwork, chores, or whatever else you can imagine. In the event that this technique is supposed to have some additional features in the particular fanfiction you go to, or even a better version, this scroll will contain both versions.
Some of the best shadow clone fanfic features include shadow clone self charka regeneration, temporal split clones instead of normal clones, mind merging without dispel, constant hivemind like connection etc.
FREE: Chakra Coils- The basic ability to use chakra, as represented by ""chakra coils"" that are a nebulous part of your body and/or soul now. You have top-quality chakra coils which would place you in the top 5% in this world in terms of both capacity and control.
After this jump your chakra system and body continue to function just as they do in this world, retaining any improvements or additions made along the way. You may also, if you choose to, induce the development of chakra coils in other people simply by pushing some of your chakra into them.
FREE: Academy Training- You already have all the basic training necessary to start on your career as a ninja. Your physical stats and resilience are what civilians would call 'peak human' and you can mold chakra, use kunai and shuriken, do the academy three jutsu (henge, kawarimi, and bunshin), and have learned a basic taijutsu style. You've even studied ahead a little and learned tree climbing, chakra-boosted jumping, and several D-rank techniques.
FREE: Elemental Affinity- Not much to see here. You have an extremely strong elemental affinity in one of the five primary elements of this world, those being Fire, Wind, Water, Earth and Lightning. The first purchase of this perk is free, second and onwards cost 100 CP though you must purchase a different primary element each time.
FREE: Ninja Weapons-You have a pouch full of all kinds of general use ninja weapons, like shuriken, kunai, senbon, each of multiple kinds and sizes, up to and including things like fuuma shurikens and the rest. It also has many spools of ninja wire, along with the other slightly niche materials, and everything is of the very highest quality, prime Higurashi product."

for the squeamish or faint of heart."
3,,200CP,Book of Basic Formations,Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms,Domain: Databases: Magical,"A book detailing the various ways formations work and how to master the basics. With such good
instructions, anyone could begin to learn the Dao of Formations, although its eventual mastery depends
on your own effort and skill. The book updates to be appropriate to your level of cultivation, so it'll never
be useless.
* Not just a type of runes, you will need resources to make anything, quite expensive ones too."

Vandalieu using his Death magic and raw metals, changing the metals into more powerful forms on par
with adamantite and Mythril, or into rare and unique metals capable of influencing the soul and body
themselves. While this option does not give you said metal, what you are instead given is a guide on how
to imbue Attribute mana into metals to create entirely new forms. These new metals will each be unique
in some way, such as being liquid until heated a great deal, and will in turn each possess powerful and
useful abilities related to their element. A liquid metal that heals those who eat it and metal that
somehow affects the soul itself, this and other effects unknown and untold are yours for the discovering.
Just note, however, that a great deal of mana will be required, and perhaps a method to speed it all
along.
* Existing examples are death magic
* Death iron: Better than steel, liquid until heated, self repairing, only forgable by undead, easier to
enchant with death magic
* Dark Copper: Impact resistent, liquid until heated, self repairing, only forgable by undead, easier to
enchant with death magic
* Soul Silver: Used to make life with a soul in setting,
* Life Gold: Heals people who eat it.
* Attributes include Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Light, Time, Space, Life, death. Fanwank each metal
combined with each magic, assume that it probably doesn't touch the soul since that's death magics
thing, and is easier to enchant with same attribute magic, and it might not be immediately combat
useful."

come from when one does not live in human society, where there is not a mine to be found or a field to
grow plants or animals in? Monsters. The scales of dragons, the claws of wyverns, the bones of
dinosaurs, from all of these things can tools be made, though it would take someone who is quite
creative to figure out how some of them can be made. That's where this comes in, as detailed within this
book are guides on what can be made from which animals, which plants, and which monsters, as well as
where all of its components can be found. Plate armor from a dragon's scales, a spear from a wyvern's
claw, a club from a dinosaur's bones, all this and much more are described within, though the exact
techniques to combine these materials will be left to you.
* Standard fantasy fare."

stone or wood. The golems it describes are weaker than a human adult, but tireless and mindlessly
obedient to their creator. Though casting the creation spell is costly for a beginner, it is not impossible,
and will grow easier with practice. Comes with one golem premade."
7,,200CP,Inkgate Schemata,Van Helsing,Domain: Databases: Magical,"Normally one only finds these in Borgovia, where the 'veil' between the real world and the Ink is
thinnest. Also mostly as the 'Ink' is practically unknown outside of Borgovia. Regardless, the Inkgates you
can learn to create with this schematic will allow you to use the inky blackness between worlds as a
method of teleportation. These gates, once made, are indestructible - but unfortunately (or fortunately)
can be used by anyone so long as they know the command word. Note: Interplanetary Inkgate systems
are slightly outside of the schematic parameters."

9,,200CP,Ritualist's Library,Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality,Domain: Databases: Magical,"You have here a great treasure trove of knowledge; a library of books from ritualists across the world,
since the time of Merlin onwards. Each of these tomes is a copy of the personal notes of a powerful
magus who researched and recorded at least one ritual. These notes are incredibly useful, containing
several potent rituals, but that's not what's special about them. The real power in this library lies in
something it lacks; the Interdict of Merlin. The books in this trove bypass the Interdict, allowing anyone
who reads one to learn magic sealed behind that ancient law without the aid of another living mind."
10,,200CP,Schoolbooks,Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality,Domain: Databases: Magical,"You gain a collection of all of your school materials for a seven year course at Hogwarts (assuming
Defense Against the Dark Arts is taught by a competent professor assigning a high-quality set text for all
seven years, so in reality probably a bit better in that regard), as well as Muggle school up through British
Secondary School. Learning and teaching from these books is easier than normal, enough to almost
make up for a lack of an instructor. Lost or gifted books are replaced via owl order within one week at no
cost to you. Yes, even if there's no logical way for an owl to reach you with a full set of magical textbooks.
If your starting age is above 11, you're assumed to have been learning at an appropriate pace from these
books for however long you've been at Hogwarts, or should have been at Hogwarts in the case of a
Drop-In. Post-Jump, anyone studying from a set of magic textbooks which they own gains the ability to
use Atlantean Magic. Gifted and re-gifted books never lose the magic-granting ability, stolen books do
not grant magic until returned to the rightful owner."
11,,200CP,Youma Books,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Databases: Magical,"You have a collection of supernatural books, such as grimoires written by magicians, valuable historical
texts about supernatural occurrences, letters soaked in feelings until they began to take a life of their

grimoire is the result of thousands of years of research by one of the most powerful demon lords of Hell

this grimoire whether created by the same demon lord or a copy of it, it doesn't matter it's yours now."
17,,300CP,Talking Head,Dresden files,Domain: Databases: Magical,"Something between a magical computer and a lab assistant, this Spirit of Intellect would have forgotten
more about magic than most wizards ever knew if it was actually capable of forgetting without being
ordered to. Its personality is something between your own and how you think it should behave, which
means you're probably getting something close to Bob if you're not careful. Aside from dispensing
forgotten lore, they're able to possess and control things, ranging from friendly dire housecats to giant
stone lions, and can even act as an emergency mystical battery if need be. Includes a free storage skull."
18,,400CP,Do it yourself Dungeon heart,Dungeon Keeper Ami,Domain: Databases: Magical,"Not exactly a dungeon heart, this is actually a book explaining how to make the gold powered dungeon
hearts found on the avatar islands, though it relies less on the power of the dark gods for mana it also
has a much lower output than the older model organic dungeon hearts. While a person can be made a
keeper using this kind of heart and existing keepers can use them as well it has many flaws such as the
inability to create living imps, having a much much lower mana output than normal keeper hearts,
requiring large amounts of gold in order for it to create mana as a normal heart would. On the plus side
you can change its looks to some extent, generally it will keep the glowing orb in the center in some
fashion but the other parts can be changed into quite a few different designs from plant statues, to
bones, even a small crystal pyramid."
19,,400CP,Space Magic,Generic Lewd Sci-Fi,Domain: Databases: Magical,"Call it psionics, subspace manipulation, The Force, Biotics or anything else, it all boils down to space
magic; tapping into some galaxy-permeating network of energy and using it to do things.
At the 200cp level, you are an apprentice space wizard, able to focus mentally to create many minor
effects ranging from telepathy, to telekinesis, to short-lived hypnosis and brainwashing, opening your
mind to sense nearby things, ‘reading’ auras on beings or objects and much more. However, you may not
understand or know of everything your power can do, and your concentration can be easily shattered.
At the 400cp level, you will start as a fully-fledged space wizard, having much greater versions of those
powers at your call - able to link your mind with others across interstellar distances, lift a whole starship
into the air with your mind, cross a planet by stepping through hyperspace or thrall someone’s mind for
good. Your concentration is rock solid, even against excruciating pain. However, you are already almost at
the ‘soft peak’ of power – any significant improvement above this level will take years of meditation,
practice and research."
20,,400CP,Grand Library,Dishonored 2,Domain: Databases: Magical,"Built of dark grey stone and the rich wood of Serkonos's mountain forests, the grand library seems
embedded with a chasm, crossed with catwalks and bridges. It contains thousands of books,
painstakingly hand-written on occult and metaphysical topics, and hundreds of years of research on the
astronomy and metaphysics of the world can be found in their leather covers. While rare diamonds of
practical knowledge are scattered between the books, the more academic literature is likely to help you
in developing your own magics or rituals. The Grand Library updates for each new jump, adding further
shelves of books along grey stone escarpments, and providing a comprehensive academic knowledge
base of the metaphysics, magic and dimensions of your local setting, though it will not contain books
which already exist. The Grand Library attaches to your Cosmic Warehouse or other pocket dimension."
21,,400CP,Library,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain: Databases: Magical,"You have a copy of the Scarlet Devil Mansion’s library. It’s very extensively furnished with grimoires and

patience to study the vast trove of wisdom."

more apparent than in her library, a home to many lost and obscure magical tomes. Now, it seems you
have come to possess a library of your own, equally massive and chock full of rare, obscure, and lost
magical knowledge. In future Jumps, this library will update and expand to encompass the vast majority
of that world's historical magical knowledge, barring tomes that are one-of-a-kind. You'll need to get
those yourself."

Duat, researching the natures and mechanics of those regions, as well as the spirits and gods that called
those places home. His field notes - and the many powers and dangerous spells that resulted from them,
later became known as the Book of Thoth. By purchasing this, you gain a collection of his notes about
the nature of gods, spirits, and other dimensions and planes of existence in this setting, which could be

food and medicine recipes, wine-making tricks...if it counts as a recipe used by the Gallic people at this

methods of defending yourself. These schematics show you what is required to integrate time circuitry

27,,400CP,Uchiha Jutsu Archive,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Domain: Databases: Magical,"The Uchiha really were quite shameless in their day, always going around copying everybody else's
lifetimes of hard work just by using their special eyes. Well, at least you get to benefit from that.
Somehow you've obtained a copy of the complete Uchiha Jutsu Archive, everything that several
generations of dedicated intellectual property thieves could copy from every other ninja village, clan and
small ninja child in the Elemental Nations. Pretty much any and every technique, seal, chemical formula,
pill/cookie recipe or random dance routine that that one Uchiha liked can be found in here. Any
knowledge that wasn't limited to literally just one person, family, or bloodline or was based purely on
sealless chakra manipulation (such as the Rasengan) and thus uncopyable by the Sharingan is in the
archive, all of them laid out in such a clear and concise format that any half-competent ninja could teach
himself just by reading the scroll. This archive will update with a complete set of spells, fighting styles,
etc, etc. from any setting that you have visited and will visit in the future. Provided it could be generously
called public, or even semi-private, knowledge it will be in here. Only the most super-secret, utterly
private techniques are missing; after all, even the best copyright pirates can't get everything. This place is
comprehensively warded against thievery, somewhat ironically, and it would take a team of top-tier
infiltration specialists to even attempt to breach it. Of course its best defense is that, at least at jump
start, no one knows you have it. Post jump you can have this become a warehouse attachment."

everything in one place, and it is with that in mind that I offer you this. Whether you wish to place this in
a mountain range so that it is hidden away from the eyes of most, or have it as a Warehouse attachment,
this ancient site contains everything one needs to build an order. Rooms for monks to stay in, a great
library to fill with many books, a courtyard to practice, an armory for magical items you may possess, and
even a storage unit that supplies as much mundane food, water, and tea to sate those who follow the
Mystic Arts. Even better, those who practice here will find their minds opening more quickly than usual,
having an accelerated effect that will leave training of the body and mystical practices half again as
effective. ...oh, and there's a wifi router installed.
Chakra Books (100CP) It can be difficult for those who are unaware of the world around them to grasp
that they know nothing. It can also be difficult to show them just how small their worldview has been all
this time, or help them. But the first step to learning is awareness. This is a substantial supply of books
regarding the body, such as a map of the nervous system, MRIs, and more importantly, chakra points and
how to open them. These maps for the body will help bring awareness to would-be students, and how to
show them the wonders of the world or themselves. For an additional undiscounted 100CP, you may also
gain a substantial collection of spellbooks that will assist in helping you learn the formation of spells, the
art of drawing energies to power them, and the basics in casting them. Just be aware that the warning
labels come AFTER the spells.

Snippy, bantering, sarcastic, call it whatever you want because they'll call it whatever they want as well. The point is they're not the only ones now. That is, they don't have a monopoly on sounding high and mighty. Mainly because you can keep up with them. Tony Stark's sharp tongue will have competition, the Avengers' humor will have another player, I think you're getting the drift.

summon town destroying storms, bring statues to life, and even allow you to travel through time. These
spells require a lot of power and skill to use, so you better be ridiculously strong (or at least have a

and face in the minds of alchemists throughout the world. This is obviously a difficult task, but this little
notebook is an amalgamation of notes and ideas that could elevate you to the rank of Magnus once
joined and implemented. You may select the precise nature of what the final form of this project is, but it
will be at the level of a sword that nulls magic, a potion that cure all diseases or armor that makes the
user immune to physical attacks."

books full of strange rituals, handcrafted wands and staves, strange reagents, and heavy robes and
wizard hats. Unlikely to ever match an Orb for raw power or speed. However, they come with an
interesting inversion. Over the years of being used, ambient magic has seeped into them. Even someone

unknown origin. It's written in both an old language and in code, but if you were to translate it, you
would eventually discover details on a powerful magical art - the art of sealing powerful entities, even
contradictory ones, into a single vessel to create artifacts similar to Sacred Gears. These items would gain
a host of powers from the being that was sealed away, though the ritual is costly depending on how
strong said being is...perhaps you could find a use for it?
Sacred Gear Import (0CP) Do you have an item you are particularly attached to that you’ve entered this
world with? A keepsake, a magical item, or some weapon of note? You may ‘import’ it as your Sacred
Gear, whether custom or taken from the list below, gaining all of its benefits and potential. If the item

his experiments on hollows, such as White, Wonderweiss, and Tousen, and the modifications he made to

patterns that exist, and with a lot of work, reverse engineer them and adapt them to new hollows."
35,,800CP,Sithe Blueprints,Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse,Domain: Databases: Magical,"The Sithe are many things. What they cannot be considered however is inept. Their technology puts
everything within this Chaosverse to complete shame. With this item you gain blueprints with details on
how to create any and all Sithe technologies, from Realmships, to even something like the Decimatus
Wave. The instructions are good enough that even a newly ascended World God could make full use of
them. Of course these technologies require materials that may not exist in this Chaosverse, thus many
equivalents are listed in the plans.
* Sithe are as the perk suggests, from a different Chaosverse, with different Prime Daos. Tech works fine
in the protags Chaosverse, through, but they can't build it.
* This is a cultivation setting, meaning tech is OP, but ridiculously expensive.
* The Realmship can travel at an undisclosed but fast speed. Some basic calculations using comments in
the books suggest we are talking at some orders of magnitude faster than 10^18 times the speed of
light, and they do not need to speed up or slow down, and can withstand several blows from an eternal
emperor, who is 2 levels above being able to destroy a solar system sized world. Can be used in personal
combat, as shown in the books.
* The Decimatus Wave can destroy the universe. Mostly by running it over since it is the size of a
realmverse. Designed to drain energy from a Chaosverse, hastening a heat death. Call it a multiverse
killing weapon
* Other examples include the grassland world, a prison, and the worldsetting stele, a last ditch attack.
* This tech can go toe to toe with all the but the highest tier cultivation level from this world. The highest
tier being high multiverse level"

creation of the first few Asauchi. For starters, you need a blacksmith's forge, a menos class hollow, some
ridiculously hot flames, and a small ocean of water to cool it off afterwards. Mind you, this book only
details the first few Asauchi, whom Oetsu declared failures. Making a 'proper' Asauchi will require time
and experimentation."
37,,800CP,The Great Library,Warlock of The Magus World,Domain: Databases: Magical,"The Great Library is located in your Warehouse, and is set up above a gigantic spell formation and is
being managed by a sentient spirit genie, which obviously is totally loyal to you, and you alone. It's in
charge of all management, and while there aren't any guards stationed here, there will never be any
incident happen here. The huge library could be said to have everything. Its information was not limited
to that about the Magus World and World of Gods; there was data about other worlds as well. There
was a large bright hall past the entrance that could hold over a thousand people without becoming
crowded. At the middle were hundreds of tables, and what looked like terminals, of which one can use
to browse through the information the library has. Further in from the data terminals and the hall was
the gigantic library that resembled a palace. Some sort of technique had been employed to expand the
space within. At a glimpse, one would see bookshelves as massive as mountains, all so densely packed
and numerous that there seemed to be no end.
Upon visiting any Worlds/Jumps/Dimensions, the library also updates to contain every public
information, including any data that you can easily acquire if you put your mind to it, of that Worlds and
its neighbor, which include other dimensions. And will continuously update, self-correct and improve any
information it has. As long as it's information that the spirit genie has a backup of, it can be duplicated as
anything you want, such as books, scrolls, data pad, storage drive, etc, as long as you have the materials
required. It can contain an immeasurable amount of data, and will never forget it. Even if the data has
already been updated and improved or even if the timeline changes, it will still contain the old versions.
You can place the Great Library in the real world, letting in all kinds of people to exchange for
information, you can freely set the payment. Such as making it so that to obtain information inside, one
needs to give it information that the library did not have, paying your preferred currencies to view it, or
doing some mission you set out to gain access to it. It will be completely normal for everyone, and won't
trigger any red flag, taxes, government authority, copyright infringement, Gods, World Will, etc. You can
freely set which information is public, which requires payment, and which is never to be seen by the

38,,800CP,The Hands of the Maker,Generic Exalted,Domain: Databases: Magical,"You have gained a forbidden knowledge. A dusty tome has come into your possession and within it
dwells the secrets of producing Alchemical Exalted, one of the greatest creations ever made by a Titan
devoted to Craft. It could take a hundred mortal lifetimes to glean even the barest secrets of this
knowledge, though one who is Exalted above others might manage it in as little as one. It contains
instructions on how to make all the various types of Alchemical Exalted and, unlike the Alchemicals that
were first created, these instructions show how to create improved versions. Ones that are immune to
the dread sickness that so afflicted the Maker and far less susceptible to the vagaries of Clarity.
This is only the knowledge to create these beings, and someone that desires to make use of this
knowledge will need to secure the materials, infrastructure, and other reagents needed on their own.
The Jumper, and only the Jumper, is guaranteed to one day be able to make Alchemical Exalts if they
study this, even if they wouldn't normally be capable of such, though it may take a very long time
indeed. While you may discover the method of the creation of Alchemicals, how their Exaltation itself is
formed will elude you, no matter what method you attempt, until such time as you have gained your
Spark.
Further you will discover that no method you are capable of will be able to utilize the Alchemical
Exaltation for anything other than powering the Alchemical that it has attached itself to. This, too, will be
something that will be beyond your comprehension until such a time as you have gained your Spark. As a
reminder Alchemicals were once people and while the process may have changed them both in looks
and abilities they are people still. So unless you take them as companions, or have some other method
of bringing them with you into future worlds, you will not be able to take them with you. Finally the
process of making an Alchemical does not infuse into them any sort of loyalty to you, so beware if you
have used this knowledge to force this condition upon the unwilling."
39,,800CP,The Quincy Alphabet,Bleach 4.03,Domain: Databases: Magical,"This is Yhwach's diary. It's pink, covered in glitter, and it looks like it's written in 57 different languages.
Good luck translating it. But if you do manage to do so, and I can assure you ten years isn't enough time
to do so, it contains instructions on everything Quincy related. From how to lobotomize your own soul
and give it to others, thus making them Quincy, to how to reintegrate those pieces, and how to make the
Schrift out of them. Also contains instructions on how to make all of the Quincy weaponry. The Bankai
stealing medallion is notably absent."
40,,1500CP,Spell Models | Magus Cultivation | Wizard Cultivation | High Grade Meditation Technique,Warlock of The Magus World,Domain: Databases: Magical,"Spell Models (600CP) In this world before a Magus can cast a spell they must first comprehend a spell
model. To put it into perspective the spiritual force is the primer, and the spell model is the catalyst the
primer remains the same, but under the effect of different catalysts, different types of energy particles
will be attracted to it to form a different spell. Nowadays, spell models are very hard to find in this day
and age especially if you do not possess any backing and it would be so rude if you were to be sent to a
world as dangerous as this without any protection wouldn't it so for the prices set above you can
purchase spell models.
*For 50 CP you can purchase rank 1-2 spell models.
*For 100 CP you can purchase rank 3-4 spell models.
*For 150 CP you can purchase rank 5-6 spell models.
*For 200 CP you can purchase rank 6-7 spell models.
*For 300 CP you can purchase rank 8-9 spell models.
With each purchase you can buy 5 spells e.g. for 50 CP you can buy 5 rank 1 or 2 spells. Of course, you
can purchase Wizard/Arcanist spell models here too. Or for a cost of 600 you may gain a book with every
single spell ever developed in this setting, unfortunately it will not update in future jumps.

* If you already have those perks then subtract 900 from the cost of this
* You need cultivation to use the spells so these extra perks are needed."
