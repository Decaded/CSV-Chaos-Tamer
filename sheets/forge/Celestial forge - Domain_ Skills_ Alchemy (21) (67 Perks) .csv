1,,100CP,Alchemic Prodigy,Elder Scrolls Online,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"One of the most profitable and respected professions in Tamriel, a good alchemist can find lucrative work just about anywhere on Nirn, from Necrom to Stros M'Kai. Aside from a good bit of experience in identifying herbs that can be used for medicinal (or malign) creations, you have enough experience to work with up to Rank Five solvents and oils (Purified Water and Pitch Vile respectively), with a whole decade to learn even more. Healing potions, potions to bolster physical attributes, or even debilitating poisons can not only be produced, but with adequate testing you can even begin to mix and match their effects by combining the right ingredients."
2,,100CP,Alchemy ,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Your brothers and sisters in battle often need a health potion after a hard fight, and you have always been there to help out. You are a capable alchemist able to work with almost any ingredient to make potions with the effects you need, and find substitutes for absent ingredients. Some more potent potions still stump you, though, and inventing new recipes is beyond you."
3,,100CP,Alchemy Knowledge ,Golden Sun,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Alchemy was sealed long ago, but you've spent your entire life researching what little is left of its secrets, and the society of the ancients that used it. While mostly theory, this knowledge could serve you well should you seek out the ancient's settlements, or perhaps in greater ways in the years to come."
4,,100CP,"Collection of Spirit Flames and An Ultimate, Illustrated Guide to Food Ingredients ",Talisman Emperor - Mortal Dimension,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"These two books are each roughly the size of a volume of an encyclopedia, though the level of detail is closer to that of a college textbook. Together, they are the ultimate reference on preparing delicacies with spiritually powerful effects. Collection of Spirit Flames describes various spirit flames of different attributes from the first-grade to the fifth-grade, each of which is used with different ingredients and at different times in the cooking process. An Ultimate, Illustrated Guide to Food Ingredients lists tens of thousands of spirit herbs, fruits and vegetables, grains, demon beasts, wild animals, and so forth, as well as their effects when consumed. Even non-spirit chefs can benefit from their clear explanations of how to control spirit flames and how some poisonous plants, mushrooms, etc. can be prepared safely for consumption. An Ultimate, Illustrated Guide to Food Ingredients updates in future jumps to list ingredients from that setting. While they remain the same size no matter how much information or how many pages are inside, you will always open the books to exactly the page you were looking for if you have something specific in mind."
5,,100CP,Tinkerer ,God Catching Alchemy Meister,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Many believe that alchemy is just mixing up random things to make potions or hit a lump of iron until it becomes a steel sword. They don't know the truth. Alchemists like you need several skills to get their license: starting with blacksmithing to create weapons and armor, chemistry and herbalism to mix potions that work, anatomy of both monsters and people so they can loot properly and their creations don't end up causing harm to the users, different forms of art to cater the clients; mineralogy and even some basic knowledge of magic, for enchanting their works. You are decently trained in all these skills, which are the basis for any alchemist to thrive in society."
6,,100CP,Alchemy ,Banjo-Kazooie,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You are incredibly capable at mixing together mundane ingredients to create effects that can only be described as magical. For a short time, these potions can create temporary copies of you, turn you invisible, or give you shielding."
7,,200CP,Albedo ,Lords of the Night - Zombies,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"The counterfeit flame of life burning in the soul of every Alchemical is both gripped by Decay, and yet at the same time burns all the possibilities of Alchemy. This has granted you odd insights into how to break down and reform matter. You can make various alchemical substances, products that have impossible properties. Using sand as a base ingredient, you could smelt it into stone that once it hardens, is highly flammable. Or both pliable yet harder than steel. Such transformations are partly fueled by the flame of false life that burns within you - it is an alchemical flame almost without equal, and when utilized properly it can have incredible properties. You need proper tools to work and transform the materials you're working with. You're alchemically treating the materials, not enchanting them, so you can't simply 'lay' the effect on them. Whatever you end up doing should be something that can be framed as 'material properties' rather than 'enchantments.'"
8,,200CP,Alchemist ,A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"The fine art of turning lead into gold in the quest to create the immortal granting elixir of life. What few remember is that alchemists rely on more than just magical ingredients for their mixtures. Chemicals, elements, oils, tinctures, spices, metals, it is not the magic that matters to you but the results of the combined reaction. Your abilities at brewing are beyond that of even the most skilled potioneers as anything that relies on ingredients to create you can make. Your favorite marinade, new alcoholic beverages, beauty products, intangibility potion, napalm, whatever you set your mind to you can make a reality. You know all the proper techniques and tricks to squeeze the most essence out of your ingredients, how to harvest them without botching it, how to store them so they don't lose any of their potency. You know the best ways to prepare them, the best time to add them, how to get the reaction you want and all the steps to achieve it. You can even tell which ingredients compliment each other best based on smell, taste, touch, and any record of their properties. If being a master potion maker isn't your goal well there's always opening a bar, getting your own cooking show, or running a chemical factory of some stripe because a philosopher's stone is something you could make by just cracking open a few chemistry and potion books."
9,,200CP,Alchemist ,Overlord - The Series,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You are capable of brewing potions with magical effects. You can easily create 'true' healing potions that provide instantaneous healing rather than healing-over-time, and can make potions for any 'buffing' spells you know that are in the ranked magic system such as flight, invisibility, increased magic resistance, physical boosts, and so on. Obviously you must actually know a spell in order to make a potion with that spells effect. Additionally to make use of this talent you must actually have the means to make the potions in the first place such as an alchemist's lab or, for slimes, your own body."
10,,200CP,Alchemy ,Final Fantasy IV,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"A lack of magic makes you no less useful, and you've learned how to make use of the various potions and other items on a grand scale. You can mix together multiple items, compounding their effects. It doesn't create something new, but instead additively combines the source materials into something with as much potency, to the upper limit of five times the strongest of your source materials."
11,,200CP,Alchemy ,Masters of Magic,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"While all wizards are capable of converting gold to mana, and vice versa, the process is very inefficient for them, losing half of the value in the process. You can do it perfectly, without any loss, making it potentially feasible for you to power your magic through taxation, for example. In future jumps, this will provide a boost to alchemical abilities, especially those converting one substance into another. You only retain the ability to convert gold to mana (and vice versa) in future jumps if you purchase this ability, which would provide one way to obtain mana in the future."
12,,200CP,Alchemy ,Samurai Jack,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,The ancient science of mixing specific ingredients and then infusing them with natural energy. You know how to make a wide array of potions with both beneficial and harmful effects.
13,,200CP,Alchemy ,Unmodded Minecraft,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You know Minecraft's alchemy recipes front to back, and understand enough of the theory to begin experimenting with the ingredients of this world and others to make new potions. You'll also occasionally get a little more out of your efforts than expected, sometimes getting a free second potion at the end of the distillation process, and rarely a third."
14,,200CP,Alchemy ,World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"The art of alchemy is much, much older than many know. These older alchemists were much less interested in transmuting lead to gold and instead developed a pharmacopeia of drugs, potions, and poisons. You are knowledgeable and skilled in the mundane forms of alchemy, but you are also capable of brewing more impressive supernatural concoctions. From simple tonics to improve one's attributes, to love potions, to philters that grant supernatural protection. You begin knowing only the weakest forms of these but you can improve your alchemical skill and even develop new recipes. Alchemical drugs can be prepared in the form of a classic potion, a salve that must be applied to the skin, or an essence that must be inhaled."
15,,200CP,Crafting: Alchemy ,Aion SB,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You have begun learning the basics of the crafting techniques of this world. Each purchase of this perk lets you select a category of crafting from the list below; making you proficient in the basics of that craft. You must choose a different category with each purchase. Your skill in one of your chosen fields is now comparable to those hailed as masters of that profession. This can also be bought multiple times, but each purchase must be used on a different field of crafting."
16,,200CP,Dao of Alchemy,Renegade Immortal,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Alchemy is the art and science of using spiritual materials and reagents to create miraculous pills and concoctions with an incredible range of effects. From pills that can heal grievous wounds or cure horrific diseases to poisons so terrifyingly potent that just a single breath can melt the flesh from your bones. Elixirs that induce states of enlightenment or restoratives that can drastically improve your cultivation, help you break through bottlenecks or just simply refill your reserves of spiritual energy when you are low.
For the less talented, alchemical creations can represent their only hopes to break through to the higher stages of cultivation, be it the Foundation Establishing Pill, the miraculous medicines that can allow for the creation of nascent souls or even stranger things.
You are an incredibly talented alchemist with an intuitive grasp of the process of pillmaking as well as the way ingredients may interact, allowing you to make leaps in the process of refinement, or even creation of new recipes, that would require years of hard study for others. This kind of talent allows you to easily analyse and recreate pills with a short period of examination.
Talent isn't everything though. A senior with decades of experience will always do better than a pill genius on their first time. You have the equivalent of a good decade or two of practical experience with alchemy under your belt as well as a wealth of theoretical knowledge. If a reagent or pill has existed on Suzaku or in myth, then it's likely you know of it and the ways that it can be used or otherwise nurtured if it is not yet ready. This knowledge will update itself to include similar disciplines in future jumps."
17,,200CP,Natural Remedies ,Twokinds,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Academic pursuits are all fine and good, but mages need to make a living like anyone else. To that effect, most of the magically inclined make money by selling alchemical solutions and other plant-based compounds. Your knowledge of alchemy and herbalism lets you craft everything from common medicines to potent poisons. While not as powerful as purpose-built magic, these natural alternatives are the preferred purchases for all but the wealthiest of patrons. Any village would welcome an alchemist like you."
18,,200CP,Neoalchemist ,The Glass Scientists,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Invisibility serums, subtle poisons, superspeed formulae, if the Victorians ever imagined it could be done with chemistry, you can do it."
19,,200CP,Potioneer ,Hercules,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"There is a lot of magic in this world, and a lot of it takes the form of potions. Which is great for you, as you're now a truly superb potioneer and alchemist. You have a gift for mixing ingredients, enriching them with magic if you need to or just cutting and preparing them just right. You're also brilliant at coming up with improving recipes or coming up with new ones, having a gift for these things. Making a potion that turns a god into a mortal is well within your capacities provided the right ingredients, and that's only one potion."
20,,200CP,Slime ,Overlord - The Series,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"There are many types of slimes and oozes. All of them uniformly are next to impossible to hurt with physical attacks, but are incredibly vulnerable to one type of elemental damage (fire for a regular slime, ice/cold for a lava slime, etc) and also possess a slight weakness to magic in general. You possess the ability to take on a human form that will pass even close inspection, while losing none of the benefits that come with being made up of an amorphous slime-like substance, and possess physical abilities at least twenty times that of a human. Including speed, despite how odd that may seem. You can naturally fit through tight spaces, shape your body into unnatural forms, and can make as many 'feelers' or 'manipulator arms' as you like. In truth you're more like a uniformly colored Shoggoth than you are anything else, except without all the eyes and body parts. Slimes are also powerfully acidic and can inflict grievous acid damage on anything they touch; you naturally possess the ability to determine whether or not your acid will damage the things you are in contact with. All Slimes are naturally good at alchemy and can create alchemical substances and magical potions, if they possess the knowledge of their creation, directly out of their own body. Slimes, due to their nature, are ageless."
21,,300CP,Alchemist ,Dishonored 2,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Did you study under Hypatia, the famed alchemist of Addermire? Or perhaps you were from Gristol, and were tutored for some time by Sokolov and Joplin, who famously created the cure for the rat plague more than a decade ago? It matters not. Medicine, botany and chemistry is where your talent lies, and while the 'wet sciences' are not as flashy as those of clockworks or galvanics, there is no end to the utility they can be put to.
You are a masterful producer of tinctures and remedies, but also poisons and other chemicals that find use in combat, like gunpowder and the ingredients used in explosive projectiles and the Howlers' bombs. You'll be sure to get a lot of customers, whether for your beneficial concoctions, or your baneful ones. You might even surprise yourself with what your mixtures are capable of."
22,,300CP,Alchemist ,Morroblivion,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You are a skilled alchemist, capable of making strong potions and poisons and knowing what ingredients are required."
23,,300CP,Alchemy ,Castlevania,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Through careful experimentation and research, you've gained understanding of the true nature of God's creation of the world. You may now utilize a lesser form of this art to create items of power, ranging from potions and charms to powerful weapons to drive back the forces of evil. You also understand the basics of a darker form of this art, enabling you to understand and counter evil rituals."
24,,300CP,Alchemy ,Gothic,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You can identify local plants and their properties and create magical potions. Healing and mana potions are the most common on the market, but with some unusual ingredients you might be able to create potions that permanently improve the drinker's body. You also know how to brew or distill various alcoholic beverages."
25,,300CP,Alchemy ,World of Warcraft,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Mix potions, elixirs, flasks, oils and other alchemical substances into vials using herbs and other reagents. Your concoctions can rejuvenate, enhance attributes, or provide any number of other useful (or not-so-useful) effects. High level alchemists can also transmute essences and metals into other essences and metals. Alchemists can specialize as a Master of Potions, or a Master of Transmutation. Zen Master: At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on even playing field with top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field."
26,,300CP,Alchemy | Mixing Mixtures ,Banjo-Kazooie,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Alchemy (100CP) You are incredibly capable at mixing together mundane ingredients to create effects that can only be described as magical. For a short time, these potions can create temporary copies of you, turn you invisible, or give you shielding.
Mixing Mixtures (200CP) Your created potions can bestow multiple effects you know, however mixing too many might cause surprises. You can Reliably mix up to a dozen elixirs without them interfering with the effects of each other."
27,,300CP,Blessing of Medicine ,Jobless In Another World,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You possess an absolute, innate, and intuitive knowledge of all plants and other organic compounds and what they can be used for in terms of making medicines, poultices, potions, remedies, and so forth. Additionally you automatically qualify as being able to make those things regardless of whether or not you possess the normal class requirements for doing so, and further possess the skills needed to actually make them no matter how complex. Even beyond that you can make things that would otherwise be normally impossible, such as elixirs of immortality (of the agelessness variety) or things like the Limit Breaker potion which would allow you to expand the level limit of a class by up to ten times its normal amount. In future worlds you will easily be able to adapt any recipes you've already discovered to use local ingredients."
28,,300CP,Creation Prodigy ,Ar Tonelico,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Grathmeldingis an artificial magic created as a safer alternative to Song Science by the Goddess Eolia. By combining items via ritual alchemical methods with a Grathnode crystal, the immense Silver Horn wrapped around the tower detects the signal emitted and computes a burst of transmutation magic in response. This ranges from creating magic swords, mechanical armour, advanced prosthetics, healing potions, guided missiles, all the way up to airships and extremely powerful emergent creations beyond the knowledge of Eolia herself. You can divine a deeper logic behind the often-bizarre recipes and have much better odds when devising new Recipes. For those who live away from Ar Tonelico, Synthesis is the more scientific form of the same process. You're just as good at this."
29,,300CP,Deranged Alchemist ,Van Helsing,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You have mastered the medieval forerunner of chemistry, and know the transformation of matter via elaborate rituals and mysticism on top of your scientific approach. The greatest secrets of Alchemy still elude you, such as the fabled Panacea, but that can be found in due time. (Hint: Nobody's found it. At all.) However, you are capable of transmutation of many materials (although it requires that said materials be the same base) and can create Homunculi from following Paracelsus' studies into alchemy."
30,,300CP,Ingredients' True Potential ,Wonderland No More,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"There are many magical foods throughout Wonderland, but many of them will not show their full potential unless used by a Gourmancer. You now have a natural knack for detecting potential ingredients (this includes living beings as well) you can use and getting a general idea of both their tastiness and what powers they might offer. If said ingredients have potential uses that wouldn't be normally available, you have greater luck at unlocking their full potential."
31,,300CP,Red In Leaf And Branch ,Earth Girls,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"The largest beasts can be felled by the smallest spearpoint if that spearpoint is covered in your poisons. You can make dozens of different poisons for all sorts of different targets and circumstances. Poison to make a pool full of fish float to the surface, for arrowheads to bring down big animals, or toxic smoke that disorientates invaders. Even some that just keeps bugs out of bedding."
32,,300CP,Shamanic Chemist ,Clive Barker's Jericho,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"As a little boy, your family made sure to pass down the ancient lessons of their family. Shamanism and Alchemy, two parts from each side now united into one student, yourself. You're an expert alchemist and an experienced shaman. Alchemy enables a wide range of potions and substance creation, from fluids that heal injuries and turn lead to gold or which assist with the creation of metals that can harm and bind spirits. A useful thing, given your Shamanism training is all about contacting, summoning, binding and then making use of all kinds of spirits, from the elementals of the earth to the ghosts of the beyond and even, if you want to walk a dangerous path, the demons of the Pyxis. Your training has incidentally given you a pretty in depth knowledge of chemistry, pharmacology and botany too."
33,,400CP,Alchemical Mastery IV ,Essential Body Modification Supplement,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Learning speed increased by x1000, applies to the art of alchemy and potion creation. At this level, you can become an Expert (equivalent of a college degree and a few years of experience) in an hour and a world-class master in ten hours. See the Notes section of the Essential Body Mod Supplement for details on how learning speed is modified by different factors."
34,,400CP,Alchemical R&D ,Buso Renkin,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You went down this path of your own free will, and since no one would willingly grant you such amazing powers without a price you had to learn everything yourself. Because of this you know everything there is to know about making homunculus, down to the best place to insert the embryos. That being said, you can't do any of this without a laboratory and whatever DNA you plan on incorporating."
35,,400CP,Alchemical Tome ,My Little Pony - Friendship Is Magic,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"A large book containing hundreds upon hundreds of recipes for magical poultices and potions and it even guides you on how to make your own potions. If purchased multiple times you will have books with rarer and more unique recipes until the fourth purchase which contains a book with merely five recipes, all of them truly legendary in potency."
36,,400CP,Alchemist ,The Mighty Boosh,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"The final, most powerful skill of the Shamans. The ability to brew potions and craft poultices that can create strange magical effects. While you can make some powerful stuff, up to the level of a pint of Shaman Juice, you still have to deal with the issue of logistics. You need to have the right ingredients on hand, and the right amount of time to brew it properly. Also this perk gives you amazing knowledge regarding how to properly create various kinds of alcohol from different base ingredients."
37,,400CP,Alchemization ,SBURB,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Alchemization is strange business, creating punch cards, double punching and overlapping them to combine items into entirely new items. It's quite an amazing process, but sometimes unpredictable, and without care you could end up with exceptionally silly results. You however, are something else. The moment you get access to an Alchemitter, you will be the most fashionable and deadly kid in paradox space. All of the style will belong to you. In addition to instinctively knowing how to find the best combinations for outfits, weapons, and such things, you'll find it also easy to make useful tools such as a Captaroid Camera, to use things in alchemy without having to actually put it into a sylladex. Handy if you want to duplicate your brain, or something too large to fit. In general, if alchemizing something is possible, you'll be able to think of way to do it."
38,,400CP,Alchemy ,Valkyrie Profile,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"At its most basic, alchemy is simply the creation of magic concoctions and items with a range of effects, from the mundane, such as healing items and exploding liquids, to the horrifying and illegal, such as the much feared Ghoul Powder that turns the living into mindless demons. From there, many alchemists learn the difficult and resource intensive formula for altering one material into another, and that's where their knowledge ends. But the true potential of alchemy is that it holds the ability to manipulate life, much like necromancy manipulates the dead. With the right knowledge, an alchemist can experiment and create horrible monsters and abominations, even imbuing them with magic and other mystical abilities, or even create a perfect simulacra of human. The one thing outside of Alchemy's power is the creation of souls, so their creations may be alive or even think, but they don't truly feel the way a natural creature would. There's nothing preventing an alchemist with knowledge of other disciplines from transferring a soul into an empty vessel, however. On the other hand, there is much more to to alchemy that nobody has yet uncovered, and further research can uncover further uses of alchemy."
39,,400CP,Berserum ,Smash Up,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You know all about various improvements to nature, a veritable cornucopia of drugs to enhance combat ability. Drugs to remove the need for rest, to harden flesh to stone, for alertness and overpowering strength and maybe the development of psychic powers! It's all very exciting."
40,,400CP,Citrinitas ,Lords of the Night - Zombies,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You can now create alchemical engines like your own Kindling flame, a physical transformation that establishes an immaterial alchemical flame inside something that then fuels further transformations. This can be used to create constructs or solid state systems that behave like mechanical systems. Yes, there are mechanical computers, and yes, such systems can be impossibly good - the alchemical equivalent of a clockwork soldier. This perk explicitly plays well with other creation and crafting abilities you have, including Albedo. The Alchemical Flames these engines are build out of are fueled by Silver, Gold, and the very fires of life. Corpus works too. It may be possible to work with other supernatural fuels, but unless it's something like the power cosmic or Quintessence, it will require significant work to adapt."
41,,400CP,Essence Distillation ,Generic Universal Monsters,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Lesser minds scoff at the idea that science can effect the soul. You know better. You have learned to brew a concoction that will draw forth all the evil in a person. Allowing it to overwhelm other personality traits and indulge in their dark desire without restraint. You're most of the way to creating a similar situation for goodness as well and proper research will allow you to do the same with other character traits, brewing liquid courage or objectively in a bottle. While under the effect of one of these drugs, a person's appearance will change, often into a body which seems to radiate the enhanced quality."
42,,400CP,Feed Me! ,Orion's Arm: The Amalgamation,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You can rapidly transmute any solid or liquid mass into the material and resources you want. By consuming mass, you may rapidly process it into something you can use to craft. Alternatively, you can just use it to build another clone."
43,,400CP,Milkshake! ,Make A Wish,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You are a prodigy at making potions, capable of preparing any type of exotic ingredients and making potions that give nightmares to even experienced masters, you have knowledge of many potions made in this world and change them to taste like strawberry milkshake or any other flavour you like, you have a knack for learning new recipes, modifying old recipes to work with new ingredients and creating new potions wholesale with creatures out of this world. You also have the less regarded ability to mix cooking talent and knowledge of chemistry with your potion making, which makes your potion making linked with cooking knowledge and chemistry."
44,,400CP,Thaumaturgical Focus[Transmutation/Alchemy] ,Fate Jumpchain,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"There exist many special arts within magecraft, and now you have gained the knowledge of one of them. There are many schools of magic to specialize in, such as Alchemy, Memory Partition, Thought Acceleration, Transmutation, Jewelcraft, Curses etc. You could even learn the Emiya art of Time Manipulation, though you will have only the very basics, and will need years just to get to Kiritsugu's level, but you may possible go even further. You may not choose any True Magic with this perk. This perk can be bought multiple times"
45,,500CP,Sburb Starter Kit | Alchemization ,SBURB,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Sburb Starter Kit (100CP) Don't feel like upgrading your Sylladex to drag your equipment back to your interdimensional warehouse? That's okay! This upgrade equips your warehouse with a Cruxtruder, Punch Designex, Totem Lathe, and Alchemiter! Now you have some extra ones,and you don't have to rob the you of this life's house. If you want any other upgrades, you'll have to make them yourself. You should be able to do that from your warehouse now though.
(Note: Purchasing this Cruxtruder and opening it for the first time will not give you another)
Alchemization (400CP) Alchemization is strange business, creating punch cards, double punching and overlapping them to combine items into entirely new items. It's quite an amazing process, but sometimes unpredictable, and without care you could end up with exceptionally silly results. You however, are something else. The moment you get access to an Alchemitter, you will be the most fashionable and deadly kid in paradox space. All of the style will belong to you.

Handy if you want to duplicate your brain, or something too large to fit. In general, if alchemizing something is possible, you'll be able to think of a way to do it."
46,,600CP,Alchemical Expertise ,eXceed,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Alchemy is the ancient art of drawing power from mystic artifacts. Unlike some variations of it you may have seen already, its core principle is imbuement and extraction.
First, one must select an object with a useful quality, then they must understand this object fully through study. Then, through this understanding, one may refine this quality into a free-floating concept. This concept may then be applied to a useful vessel, which will benefit from such.
For example, one may learn all that there is about a fighter jet, to the point of being capable of explaining everything about it and its operation and function with absolute certainty no matter what circumstances befall it. Then, one may reduce this particular jet to its Flight alone. One could then add its Flight to a suit of armor. An alchemist could then tap into the concept of Flight within it to soar.
One could do the same to an industrial electromagnetic order to acquire the concept of Magnetic Attraction, or even a living being in order to acquire the concept of Self-Replication. However, one may only bind two concepts to any given object, and they may not be removed once set."
47,,600CP,Alchemist ,Farscape,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Your knowledge of plants, animals, and chemicals allows you to mix up all sorts of different compounds. Finding cures to rare diseases, synthesizing fuel, and creating powerful hallucinogens, among other things, is a breeze for you."
48,,600CP,Alchemy ,World of Darkness - Sorcerer,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Alchemy - This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as alchemists, and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.
[1] The alchemist may create more advanced versions of mundane chemicals, such as painkillers and glue. They are not overtly supernatural, and can easily be passed off as just a better brand.
[2] All that the first dot offered and more. The alchemist can create short lived steroids and potions that grant mystical senses for short periods.
[3] The alchemist's enhancements can now create mildly superhuman physical abilities and grant low level psychic powers, at least for short periods. They can also create materials and alloys that surpass what should be possible.
[4] More potent versions of what is available at 3 dots.
[5] With great study - or a sample - of a supernatural creature, the alchemist may replicate their various mid-level abilities for short periods. More potent abilities come with side effects.
[6] At this level, an alchemist may create such miracles as the Elixir of Eternal Youth, or even induce an Awakening.
Alchemy Rituals
One dot: A powder that, when mixed with alcohol, induced sleep almost instantly., or a pill that suppresses the symptoms of the common cold or flu for a full day and halves recovery time.
Two dots: A form of LSD that grants vague but accurate visions of the future or a drug that doubles running speed for up to an hour, but leaves those with low stamina shaky and out of breath for the next.
Three dots: A metal alloy that is lighter and stronger than titanium, but easier to work, can retain an edge almost forever, and stays more resilient than the finest blade,or a metallic dust that reveals hidden, disguised, or invisible things for what they are, disrupting illusions.
Four dots: A chemical that raises physical abilities for up to eight hours, possibly even to superhuman levels. Side effects include an insatiable appetite during this period. Another option is a regiment of drugs that slows down the aging process to one twelve its natural speed.
[5] A potion of this magnitude allows its drinker to match the physical abilities of a vampire for an hour.
[5] A pungent substance that is especially disgusting to werewolves, to the point where none dare come within five feet of whatever it is smeared upon. Anyone else with a sense of smell will also be reluctant to do so, but not to the same extent."
49,,600CP,Alchemy Mondays ,I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"The ancient, and basically lost, study of alchemy. Not even in the ranks of the hidden mages of Earth you can find someone who knows much of it, well, outside you, of course. Your family was actually one of the last (if not the last) practitioners of this study field, leaving you with vast knowledge and resources to explore it. What's more, you possess an incredible raw talent for this field of study, making the secrets of this lost art an open book to you. With some effort and little time, you will be able to reproduce the great feats of alchemy, like transmuting lead into gold or create a Panacea that can cure all ailments. Not even the Philosopher's Stone is out of reach."
50,,600CP,Brain of the Moon ,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Did you study under Eirin? Like her, you can make a drug to perfectly cure any possible disease, make drugs that could manipulate the Dream World, and likely produce even more fantastical effects. This does have a few limitations, you cannot create a drug that does the impossible, you can’t cure something you do not know or understand, and you cannot make drugs without base ingredients. Perhaps if you found someone who could manipulate eternity itself you could even replicate the Hourai Elixir. This does not come with any raw materials, but you will also find ways to substitute the raw materials of other worlds for anything you could have found here."
51,,600CP,Dark Science ,9 Jumpchain,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You are familiar with the principles of alchemy, or 'Dark Science', which led to the creation of the Stitchpunks, The Machine, and the end of humanity. This knowledge lets you create devices which can interact with the mind and soul. This includes the one The Scientist used to copy his Intellect onto the Machine's core, as well as the one he used to gift fractions of his soul upon the Stitchpunks, not to mention how to properly prepare a core or homunculus to accept such things. It should be noted that homunculi with partial souls will have very exaggerated personalities, and creations imbued with pure intellect will be lacking a soul and the emotions that come with it."
52,,600CP,Darkbrew Traditions ,Dota 2,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Chymistry, otherwise known as alchemy, is your forte. Simple transmutation such as breaking silver down into copper or lead into tin are rather easy, you having discovered the secrets to brewing the required liquids for the reactions to occur with great safety and speed, and more basic brews such healing draughts which vastly accelerate cellular division and potent acids able to break down living matter and metal alike are also known to you.
Generally speaking, transmutation turns like into like, while direct concoctions perform feats the common folk would liken to regular chemistry enhanced by magic. How true that may or may not be is generally ignored by Smallkeen, as the art is incredibly useful for scientific research and the cultural hatred of magic would foul many promising leads. Whether or not you are a member of the Darkbrew family is your choice, and any particular goals regarding mountains and transmutation of gold are your own to decide."
53,,600CP,Equivalent Exchange ,Minecraft,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You are a powerful Alchemist, able to infuse a Diamond with the power of Redstone and Glowstone to make a Philosopher's Stone. With such a stone in hand, you'll be able to create a Transmutation Tablet, allowing you to instantly convert matter from one form to another, possibly even converting ordinary dirt to valuable Diamonds... or even compressing the Diamonds further into Dark Matter or Red Matter.
Combining your transmutation skills with these exotic and vastly expensive forms of matter, you'll be able to produce Alchemical Chests with incredible volume, indestructible equipment with immense power, energy collector systems to generate additional resources from nothingness, and potentially become nearly immortal, burning vast quantities of resources instead of taking wounds.
Your powers are all incredibly expensive to use, and you won't be able to max them out in your time here (especially if you don't have any advantages in harvesting resources!), but the raw potential of this path exceeds all others."
54,,600CP,Legendary Master- Cooking ,Rimworld,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"You're an expert culinarian. You could make a dish worthy of kings with nothing more than dried rice and stringy wolf meat. In addition to boosts in production speed and efficiency, you will always be recognized in any future Jumps as a chef of renown. All prepared by you gives a not-insignificant boost to mood, additionally positive effects of any cooking you do are much greater. That muffin baked with trace amounts of healing root? Before it could fix a scratch or two, now it regenerates limbs."
55,,600CP,Master Synthesist ,Kingdom Hearts,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"To make a sword you normally need metal, a tool to shape it, and a forge to heat the metal. Not you though, you can take strange and esoteric materials and magically combine them into a health potion, or a ring that increases your durability.
Once you've gotten the hang of it you'll be able to turn the rare materials you've collected into powerful items, weapons that can turn the tide of many a battle. A few examples are making arrowguns that shoot homing laser arrows and can combine to fire a giant bouncing blast, a stringed instrument that can make water dance to your tune to form aqueous duplicates to attack with, or even a deck of cards than can temporarily trap the loser of a game of chance in card form.
The greatest expressions of this craft, Save the King, Save the Queen, and the Ultima Weapon, will require years of experience, and some resources so rare you'll be lucky to find enough even if you scour all the worlds you can. The rarity and power of the materials used will impact the final quality and properties of the finished product."
56,,600CP,Reaching Omega: Alchemy ,Desolate Era II,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Something has happened to the Dao you've been cultivating Jumper, your Dao has traces of becoming an Omega one. All it would take is following your instincts to allow you to transform it into an Omega Dao. be careful however because a Dao like this means an even harder time passing the Daomerge
* A Omega dao is the highest class of dao, meaning this perk sets you on the path to becoming literally perfect with the settings version of runes.
* Dao is essentially the laws of heavens that cultivators learn to control reality. Omega laws are essentially merging all your laws into the one law to make it supreme. It is also required for reaching the peak of cultivation. So for example a omega dao of formations would allow you to create universe and multiverses with formations.
* This would easily allow you to make pills that contain universes, pills that could destroy the universe, pills that could grant limited reality warping, etc"
57,,600CP,Terrorism ,Ragnarok Online,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"While the Alchemist can create bizarre brews that allow them to create all sorts of quirky lifeforms, it becomes quickly evident that having a massive pile of bottles with all sorts of different labels is not an effective way to proceed. The solution appears to be rather simple.
Mixing everything together has some rather disastrous effects, but it does reduce the amount of bottles you need dramatically. The bottles are now creating some bizarre hybridization of the plants, which spit bombs that explode into acid, before eventually exploding. All that experimentation did help the Alchemist with one thing it's possible to mix anything together now within a magic conjured stasis field even if the field will only hold together for a short time if the mixture is...excited.
This was labelled under the Terrorism classification and never spoken of again. Presumably, other mixtures could be added in to make the plants even more...bizarre."
58,,600CP,Trigram Knowledge and Manipulation ,Journey to the West,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Alchemy and matter manipulation with the understanding of the 8 trigrams to represent the fundamental forces of reality and how to represent and enforce change using these. Let me break this one down for you. It's like FMA alchemy but with less focus on direct creation and more turning one thing into another of a similar size, including living things. However it cannot create life where there once was none and it requires you to write out a short formula describing the change to make it happen. Feel free to turn sand into water, sheep into boulders and anything else you can think of."
59,,700CP,Tinkerer | The God-Catching Alchemy Meister ,God Catching Alchemy Meister,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Tinkerer (100CP) Many believe that alchemy is just mixing up random things to make potions or hit a lump of iron until it becomes a steel sword. They don't know the truth. Alchemists like you need several skills to get their license: starting with blacksmithing to create weapons and armor, chemistry and herbalism to mix potions that work, anatomy of both monsters and people so they can loot properly and their creations don't end up causing harm to the users, different forms of art to cater to the clients; mineralogy and even some basic knowledge of magic, for enchanting their works. You are decently trained in all these skills, which are the basis for any alchemist to thrive in society.
The God-Catching Alchemy Meister (600CP) When someone asks a kid what an alchemist is, they think of a great creator that takes leaves and lumps of iron, making them into elixirs and legendary weapons. Indeed, when someone asks a kid what an alchemist is, they think of you. Because your skill, insight and experience are enough to challenge the most esteemed alchemists in this land and come out victorious.
Your creations ooze creativity, shown as they need far less materials than normal and your skill is enough to do them in less time and have far superior products compared to any other alchemist here. From accessories that make the user immune to some element, trinkets that allow for teleportation or the more direct weapons that can cause an instant death in the victims. Furthermore, your talent hasn't weaned at all, and you still see room for improvement in your works. You're one that could take the precious title of 'Meister', if not aim ever higher."
60,,800CP,Alchemical Formulae ,Generic Sugar Bowl,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Woah nelly! You could do a lot with this sort of power! Besides being able to make just about any kind of potion you can think of (nothing to make you completely invulnerable, though), you can even make a new living creature, with the right ingredients. You'll need three flowers for its skin, hair, and eye colors (or two coat colors and an eye color), some clay for body, some sugar for energy, some spice for depth of personality, and an ingredient for each personality trait you want them to have, up to eight main ones. Now, this ritual does take a month or two, and you have to hand-pick each ingredient. What's more, you need enough clay to actually sculpt a body of the size you want to make."
61,,800CP,Alchemist | Formula Formulator ,Secrets of Evermore,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Alchemist (200CP) Considered a lost art, the science of Alchemy has reawakened in Evermore, and you've been trained in its use. By combining ordinary ingredients together using an alchemical formula, you can transform them into effects that can only be described as magic. You know both Light Alchemy, the art of healing or protection, and Dark Alchemy, the art of attacking. While it's theoretically possible to learn Alchemy at a later point in Evermore, this will let you skip the training and get straight to the mixing and casting, and will make you significantly better at it to boot.
Formula formulator (600CP) Learning new alchemical formulas is pretty easy once you've got the basics down. You, on the other hand, can do something much more difficult, and much more impressive. With careful experimentation and tinkering, you can create your own formulas, allowing you to unleash entirely new alchemical effects nobody's ever seen before. Stronger or more useful effects will generally require rarer ingredients, and they usually need to relate to the effect in some metaphorical way, but as long as you keep those rules in mind you'll be coming up with new alchemy in no time."
62,,800CP,Heavenly Flame ,Battle Through The Heavens,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Within Heaven and Earth, there are some abnormally strong flames formed by natural forces. Each their own force of nature, these domineering flames are the kings of all other flames. In their presence all other flames of similar or lesser power will submit. Each flame will have its own special ability, such as triggering eruptions or attacking the soul. These flames are widely sought after by receptariers as they can be used in 'borrowing the flames' to refine pills of much higher quality, as well as break down much stronger materials. There are 23 known types of Heavenly Flames, which have been ranked according to their strength. For 400 CP you receive a Flame of rank 13-23, 600 CP for rank 4-12 and 800 CP for rank 2-3. It is a little known fact that the rank 1 flame is actually a merger of every other Heavenly Flame. Of course, it has long been suspected that there are more Heavenly Flames out there, that have yet to be discovered or created. Even some of the known flames have unknown effects. As such you can choose to create an until-now unknown flame. Its strength will match the price you buy it at.
* Can and should be taken multiple times, each of the flames have unique alchemical properties that can be looked up on the wiki.
* Bear in mind that the lower tier flames cost less, not 800CP"
63,,1000CP,Synthesis: Rank 3 | Efficiency: Rank 1 ,Atelier: Arland Trilogy,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Synthesis (400CP) Synthesis is the most basic art of the alchemist and deals with the creation of items, usually through simple mixing, though sometimes synthesis can be a complex sequence of magical and chemical reactions. All alchemists learn this to some degree.
Seeing as you're an alchemist, the synthesis of items should really be second nature to you. That being said, even if you're already an expert, there's nothing saying that you don't have room to improve further. Also there is no reason why we can't help you improve, if you're willing to put in the effort to learn.
Rank 0: The basics of synthesis, learning how to make basic potions and food without proper ingredients is still pretty helpful. Sure, you won't be making anything high quality anytime soon, but at least you can make something safely edible from refuse material. It still won't be good for you, but it won't kill you.
Rank 1: Don't like the looks of what you've made? No matter, just give it a makeover! You can substitute the appearance of what you've made with something else similar to it in nature. Of course, appearances are exactly that, so don't expect the function of your item to change.
Rank 2: Enhancing what is already present, the items that you create will often possess some small trait related to its original function, generally acting as a sort of minor boost. The nature of the trait will never go against the intended purpose of the item a potion that normally heals health may also help recover a small bit of your magic.
Rank 3: Practice makes perfect, and you're still a long ways away from perfect. Each time you make that same item, the quality of the product increases, resulting in increased magnitude of the intended effects. Though the gains will diminish the more you create a single item, you'll find that by the time you reach the plateau you'll have nearly twice the original effect.
Efficiency (600CP) As you grow in your skills as a crafter, you'll start to see more and more requests being handed your way. Before long, you're going to realize that you don't have all the time in the world to make everything that is requested of you, and that's when it becomes all the more important to complete your assignments efficiently.
Efficiency isn't just a matter of time management it's about managing waste, reducing redundancies, and above all improving yourself. Yes, you'll learn how to reduce the amount of wasteful choices you have to make but should you apply yourself to this, there's a lot more to efficiency than what you'll learn by scratching the surface. All it depends on is whether you're disciplined enough to follow through.
Rank 0: As advertised, you'll learn how to reduce the amount of waste produced during your crafting process. Achieving a 1:1 conversion will not be possible with this alone, but being able to turn the waste product into a desired product can go a long way to making synthesis more manageable.
Rank 1: if you can use less of an item, you won't need to make as much. The effect of any item that you craft is increased slightly from its original magnitude, and their durations are again increased slightly. It will take you a little longer than usual to create items but that's an acceptable sacrifice."
64,,1150CP,Mist Alchemy | Core Artificer | Refined Ichor | Mist Collector | Harvester | Lens Mastery ,Nexus 2.0,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Mist Alchemy (100CP) Mist has more uses than simply being used to create Mistlight Manifestations, the most common form is Mist Alchemy, imbuing Mist into a material to subtly alter its properties. This is a minor boon, imbuing heat aligned Mist into metal might prevent it from forming stress fractures during quenching or remove the need for tempering, while imbuing an herb with life aligned Mist might make it better suited to making a healing poultice. Minor things that, combined together, can provide useful results.
This is commonly used for making simple conveniences or simple tricks, such as pots or pans that more evenly distribute and hold heat or musical instruments that carry their tune farther than normal, rather than proper enhancements. Though medicine enhanced in this way is fairly potent.
As this skill can be learned in jump, this perk allows you to synergize the traits of wisps of Mist used for Mist Alchemy to achieve greater effects and gives you an innate intuition for how a wisp of Mist will affect an object when imbued in various ways. This stacks with the Mist Affinity perk.
Core Artificer (200CP) A surprisingly rare item to be found in Nexus is the Core, a metal, stone, or wood sphere imbued with Mist and possessing carved 'instructions' in the form of various patterns and runes. Cores are used as a way to give greater flexibility to someone's use of Light for Seed Sorcery. The Mist within the Core can be used as an external lens that rapidly shifts the Light within a Seed towards its own traits, changing a Seed to match its alignment within seconds (if already blank) or just over a minute (if already colored in another way). You know how to create such Cores. Do note, however, that this requires a good deal of Mist to accomplish, and it needs to be strong before it is imbued into a Core or it will provide minimal results. As this skill can be learned in jump, this perk allows you to power Cores with powers other than Seed Sorcery and you are capable of creating Cores that are not spheres, or are even another item entirely, such as a sword.
Refined Ichor (400CP) This small jug is filled with the refined ichor of a hacker. Worth its weight in gold, this substance is useful for a number of purposes. Most commonly, it is used alongside Mist Alchemy in enhancing a material or object or to directly enhance the effects of Mist Alchemy. Further refinement turns it into essence, which can temporarily boost one's Light as if they'd cracked a blank seed or it can be mixed with other substances to give a minor increase in Light, this is an incredibly small boost, but is noticeable. It can also be used in manipulating Mist, making refinement more precise, improving cultivation results, and making smelting easier. Finally, it can be used to enhance the innate physical ability of the user, though how this is done is only known by the demons of the Border Ring. There may be other uses, but they are largely unknown.
Mist Collector (50CP) When any creature with Light dies, they leave behind a small echo, a wisp of glittering Mist, colored similarly to the Lenses the individual possessed in life. These wisps are also touched by the memories and emotions of the being's life, altering its properties somewhat. The collection and manipulation of these wisps of Mist are the basis on which Mistlight Manifestations come into existence.
Collecting a wisp of Mist is easy, simply touching it will stabilize it and allow it to be stored indefinitely. But utilizing a single wisp of Mist to create a Mistlight Manifestation will result in a lackluster Manifestation, weak enough that even humans, who lack the reserves of light necessary to become proper hunters, prefer to make at least a few modifications before doing so. To that end, there are three methods of strengthening a wisp.
First is smelting or fusing. Taking two or more wisps of Mist and combining them into a single, new one with the traits of both. This is by far the easiest and fastest method of empowering a wisp of Mist. However, unless you know exactly what your wisps of Mist are and how they'll react, combining them in this way may lead to complications, such as opposing traits canceling out or mutating into a new trait that has a negative impact on the whole.
Second is cultivation. By 'feeding' a wisp of Mist, it is allowed to grow organically and produce new qualities and traits over time. Allowing a wisp of Mist to grow in this way is fairly simple, and with its organic growth it's unlikely to have any complications, but this process is time consuming, potentially taking weeks or months to yield the results on par with smelting or refinement.
Lastly is refinement. This is a rather difficult process that removes unwanted traits from a wisp of Mist, much like cutting and polishing a gem. This process has you excise traits and qualities from a wisp of Mist, allowing the other aspects to grow in strength as a result. This is a quick process and is unlikely to cause any real trouble, but you must be very precise and careful during the process or you may leave behind bits of what you wanted removed.
Additionally, wisps of Mist are useful for another purpose. By binding a wisp to a Seed, it can act as an artificial Lens in the use of Seed Sorcery. Seeds formed with a wisp are, however, slower to grow than those that use your own Lenses. Cracking a Seed with a wisp will often cause the wisp to dissipate, though some Seed Sorcerer's have learned how to reclaim the wisp used for this prior to cracking the Seed.
Harvester (100CP) You know a somewhat uncommon technique known as Harvesting, a process by which someone extracts a wisp of Mist from a still living being. This is not damaging, per se, but can put stress on the mind, body, and Light of the one having this done to them. Fighters will sometimes use this to get an edge if they can find an opening to pull it off. It is possible to pull wisps of Mist from yourself with this technique, but it requires a large amount of focus to accomplish without failing. You are able to reclaim wisps used in Seed Sorcery. As this technique can be learned in jump, paying for it makes it more effective, reducing the necessary focus and allowing you to use more advanced forms of harvesting, such as causing greater levels of fatigue with each wisp pulled from an individual or to temporarily empower your Light by consuming the resulting wisp of Mist.
Lens Mastery (100CP) Lenses tint Light towards their own alignment, and using them together is a matter of experimentation to get the desired results. Sapphire goblins find this far more intuitive, able to carefully manage their Seeds with ease, as if each seed had their full attention, easily sliding lenses between Seeds to create a desired result."
65,,1300CP,Simple | Advanced | Alkahestry | Truth ,Fullmetal Alchemist,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Simple (100CP) You understand the connections between parts. You can make large alchemy circles far more easily and far less complex than others. You can combine this with Advanced Formulae for multipurpose combat alchemy.
Advanced (100CP) Alchemy comes to you as easily as breathing does. Your greater understanding allows you to perform more complex alchemy. you can combine this with Simplified Formulae for multipurpose combat alchemy.
Alkahestry (300CP) You understand how to perform basic Alkahestry, an art from Xing which can perform transmutation from a distance using linked circles, and can heal wounds of many kinds by following the pulse of the body. With practice or tutoring you can make a real skill from it.
Truth (800CP/FREE) Due to the Forge the price to Truth has been paid in point's. Alternatively you can gain this sub perk for free but you must choose to lose either of the four. Your voice, your dominant hand, Your non-dominant arm, or your dominant arm. In return you gain the ability to perform alchemy without a transmutation circle and your knowledge of the science is expanded to the point where you have effectively mastered both simple and advanced Formulae."
66,,1500CP,Plasmids Are The Paint | Veni Vidi Vigor | Gatherer's Garden | Adam Slugs,Bioshock 2 + Bioshock Infinite,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Plasmids Are The Paint (300CP) ADAM flowed through every vein in Rapture to some degree. Plasmids were a force that could sway the entire economy with each new formula released. Suchong and Tenenbaum were certainly the two spearheading development, but they were not the only ones. There was an entire field of geneticists tinkering in their labs on how best to mix the human genome like a cocktail. You were one of these minds. You have a decade of practical experience playing and modifying genetics, but are particularly skilled when it comes to creating Plasmids and Tonics. While you are by no means a world-changing genius like the two greats previously mentioned, you are more than capable of creating your own ADAM-based products given a lab and supply of the substance. What you do with this knowledge is entirely up to you.
Veni Vidi Vigor (600CP) You know how to create Vigors having access to the formula and having witnessed the process. You know how to create 3 Vigors currently in existence and you are in a unique position to design and create your own through experimentation. Your experiments with ADAM are guaranteed to lack negative side-effects.
Gatherer's Garden (400CP) My daddy's SMARTER than Einstein, STRONGER than Hercules and lights a fire with a SNAP of his fingers. Are you as good as my daddy, Mister? This rather cheerful little vending machine will advertise the Plasmids and Tonics inside with the voice of a little girl and a merry melody or two. Unlike other vending machines, this one doesn't use money, but requires vials of ADAM instead. This one comes stocked with virtually every Plasmid and Tonic Rapture has to offer and never seems to need restocking, but caveat emptor. These ones come with the usual range of side effects that plagued the citizens of the city. So make sure you limit how often people use it or have a steady supply of ADAM on hand. Unless you want to create wild Splicers.
Adam Slugs (200CP) Ugly as they are, these deep sea slugs glow with the bright red of ADAM in their veins. They naturally produce the raw material, which can be harvested from them and easily refined into the necessary building blocks for Plasmids and Tonics. However, harvesting the slugs directly yields very little ADAM and would require dozens to generate a single new Plasmid. But it is what it is. It's not like you would implant them in little girls and then harvest their blood for larger amounts of ADAM. That would be monstrous. The slugs come in a small aquarium that won't need maintenance to keep them alive and will refill to contain six slugs every week. Just keep the lid on. They like to wander."
67,,1500CP,Potion Grandmaster | Magus Cultivation | Wizard Cultivation | High Grade Meditation Technique ,Warlock of The Magus World,Domain: Skills: Alchemy,"Potion Grandmaster (600CP) Potioneering is the art of using ingredients both from the natural world and from the body of powerful beasts to create powerful concoctions with an incredible range of effects. From increasing spiritual force, to creating powerful attacks that can be combined to create stronger attacks, to poisons that can kill Magus of a higher rank before they can even notice, to elixirs that can help increase vitality or help to purify a Warlock's bloodline. With time and ingredients, a potioneer grandmaster can create potions for every situation and event. From Acolytes to Rank 9 Magus all Magi of each rank require potions.
You are as the name suggests now, a Grandmaster of the art with a masterful aptitude to potion making as well as the knowledge of how a wide variety of ingredients interact. Allowing you to make leaps in the process of potion making as well as creating new or re-making old ones that would for other potioneers take decades of mind-breaking work. Of course, you wouldn't be a grandmaster with just knowledge, would you. So this comes with a 100 years of actual experience in the art, as well as a host of knowledge of all recipes found in this world barring those lost to the world. But hell maybe you can find them one day.
For another 300 CP you also gain the knowledge and skills of an Alchemical Grandmaster, which are experts in the creation of all kinds of magical items. From defensive items that protect from attacks of other mages, to one shot attacks that contain far greater power than the actual creator. But remember, the quality of an item is not just dependent on the creator but the materials as well.
Magus Cultivation (0CP) In this world there are 12 ranks that a being can achieve, 3 Acolyte ranks and 9 Magus ranks. To improve and advance through the ranks of Acolytes, an Acolyte must improve their spiritual force to reach a certain number, and have to construct mind runes with each level increasing the number of mind runes being needed. To advance to a rank 1 Magus, an Acolyte requires their spiritual force to reach a certain number, a rank 1 spell model and either Grine water or a high-grade meditation technique.
From Magus rank 1 to 2 a Magus's spiritual force must reach 80 and their elemental conversion must reach over 80%, with 99% being the maximum being reached. To advance further from rank 2-6, can simply be done by improving spiritual and soul force. From 6-8 is done by comprehending different laws and smelting those laws into their own and finding your own path. Then comprehending the laws of space and time into your own path to reach rank 9. What many do not know is that there is a 10th rank that can only be reached by creating a greater law.
Wizard Cultivation (500CP) In the World of Gods, there exist many different classes and many ways to reach stronger tiers of power. There are also ranks and tiers, to become stronger a being must reach rank 20 to become Legendary and from there can advance from a Demigod to a Greater God and eventually can become an Overgod.
The most powerful class here are Wizards, magic casters who utilize the Weave, a creation of one of the Greater Gods. The way Wizards work is by paying spiritual force to the Goddess Of The Weave to buy the authority to use magic, this manifests as spell slots. Each Wizard gains an additional spell slot as they advance in rank, with them gaining access to deeper levels of the Weave as they reach certain milestones. However as soon as they use the spells they lose the memory of the spell models. Drop-In starts out at Wizard Rank 1, Acolyte's Wizard Rank 4, Old Monster Rank 6 and Mortals start out with nothing.
Before you get too excited, Wizards come with drawbacks you see. As you are using spiritual energy to pay for spell models to insert into the spell slots. It doesn't matter how much spiritual force you possess, as the same amount is needed to pay for all the different ranks of spells. If you use all the spells and have none left you will be powerless unless you use scrolls. Also as soon as you have cast the spells, the spell models you see within the Weave are forgotten.
For 300 CP, whether as a result of luck or bloodline you are not a Wizard but an Arcanist, an attempt by Ancient Magi to merge the power of a Wizard and a Magi. Arcanists are the founding fathers of Wizardry, able to supersede the Weave's restrictions. By perceiving the energies in the environment and utilizing the elemental particles in the air, they can draw it to form arcane spells. So long as an Arcanist has enough arcane energy and the correct spell models, any spell under the legendary realm can be cast (that limitation is only if the Arcanist themselves are not in the legendary realm). They also possess the passive ability to amplify arcane energy by 10-20% when they cast spells. Arcanists can also remember any and all spell models within the Weave.
Now, if you think that isn't worth 300 CP there is something you should know Arcanists aren't simply battle spellcasters an Arcanist can do anything a Magi can; alchemy, enchanting, force-fields Arcanists are Magi with the ability to utilize the Weave and are not suppressed by the World Of The Gods. In order for an Arcanist to advance requires their spiritual/soul force to grow as well as comprehension and sensing of arcane energy.
Now, you are probably thinking that isn't good enough especially the Wizard option and you would be right so for just an extra 200 CP you are not tied to Myastra's weave anyone but to your very own. Just like Shar has her Shadow Weave you now have the Jumper Weave (name totally your decision). This weave possesses all the spells and features Myastra's does but is totally under your control giving you access to every inch of it. Unlike Myastra's, your Weave is linked to every jump you go to from now or from the past to the future allowing you access to it whenever and wherever. Oh and don't worry about it getting destroyed no one will ever notice it.
High Grade Meditation Technique (400CP) When it comes to advancing into an official Magus there are two ways this can happen either through Grine water or a high grade meditation technique. The difference between the two being that through the former you could turn a spell 1 model of your choice into your own innate one however with this method when you wished to advance later on if the spell model you chose was incompatible with your earlier ones it could result in the Magus's death as well as the fact the Grine water damages the Magus's spiritual force preventing further advancement, the latter using techniques is far greater as the technique itself provides the Magus with innate complementary spell models. With this perk, you can purchase your own meditation techniques whether canon or one you thought of yourself and yes this includes Warlock techniques. You can purchase as many as you wish for 200/400 CP each.
For 200 CP: The technique will be limited to the Breaking Dawn Realm or Rank 6 Magus/Warlock and with just this technique you will no longer be able to advance further as Rank 7 Magus/Warlock and higher needs to comprehend Laws to advance.
For 400 CP: Normally meditation techniques would be useless at Rank 7 Magus/Warlock and higher but this one is special as it compliments your elemental affinities allowing you to gain comprehension on the laws based on your elemental affinities thus allowing you to reach and become a Rank 9 Magus/Warlock. There is no limit to the rank you will be able to reach with this one day reach rank 9 of course, just because you have the way doesn't mean you WILL reach it after all talent is everything and for rank 9 you still require comprehension of space and time this method only gives you a path to that rank that will never cripple you.
Post-Jump meditation techniques works in cultivation jumps as its equivalent to the highest quality version of cultivation techniques, for 200 CP version it would only allow you to reach half of the cultivation path meaning if there are 12 ranks you can only reach peak of Rank 6, for 400 CP version would allow you to reach Rank 12 or the highest level of Cultivation.
If there are two or more cultivations paths like cultivating the body and ki, the meditation techniques would become a two in one that cultivates both body and ki, if there are more cultivating path like body, mind, soul and ki, the meditation techniques would become a four in one that cultivates all paths.
If you already have Magus Cultivation, Wizard Cultivation and High Grade Meditation Technique then subtract 900 from the cost of this
