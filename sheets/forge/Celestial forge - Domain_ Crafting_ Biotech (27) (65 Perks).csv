0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,100CP,Body Transfer ,Empire From the Ashes,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"The art and science of transferring a consciousness from body to body is a gory, ugly one. And it's one you know now. The how of moving brains from body to body, making sure no loss in memory or sanity occurs is within your grasp. And you can do it even with technology no more advanced than the 21st century. Of the world you started jumping from, smartass."
2,,100CP,Chromosome Analysis Specialist ,Biomega,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Well, the job description said training would be provided - and sure enough, they provided you with all of the reading material you needed to figure out what you were actually supposed to do now that you're here. The researchers at the Data Recovery Foundation have been put to task into deciphering the secret behind the immortal cells, that mysterious 24th chromosome. From all of the information that has been compiled, you've acquired a better picture of what the DRF is planning - but as well, your ability to break down genetic information and just large chunks of information in general have improved. Heck, reading that 42 volume tome had to be worth something right?"
3,,100CP,Crazed Physician ,Van Helsing,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Amongst the many sciences and paths you know, aside from the usual Ominous Cackling, you... Can actually patch people up easily. As a Crazed Physician, you can use the plainest tools on hand to mend any variety of wounds and injuries. As well, you know the human anatomy down to the last blood vessel, and can learn the anatomy of any other creature you dissect more easily."
4,,100CP,Demonic Augmentation ,Hellgate London,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You can successfully graft demonic parts onto yourself to gain an increase in mana reserves as well as gaining the ability to more easily cast certain spells based on the demon's type. You also learn to craft demonic focus items that, while weaker than augmentations, also don't have to be grafted onto your body."
5,,100CP,Medicine ,GUNNM,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You have the skills of a surgeon, first-responder and pharmacist, all roughly bundled together with a lot of hands-on experience with the worst injuries the wasteland has to offer. Your hands are steady, your focus unperturbed by the sight and stench of gore and viscera, and you have the precise and quick reflexes necessary to swat a fly with a scalpel. You also have a fair bit of experience with slightly inhuman and mutated physiology, and are very quick to pick up on new techniques and tools."
6,,100CP,Medicine ,Star Wars KOTOR,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Pretty much anyone can inject themselves with a stimpak or wrap an injury in bandages, but unlike you most people don't know how to do it right. You possess enough medical know how to make stimpaks and other quick healing items repair twice as much damage as they normally would and you can also treat minor injuries about as well as regular field medic. So long as you have the right supplies that is."
7,,100CP,Some Really Good String ,Claymore,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You have a sizable supply of some really good string, if you were to cut someone's torso open and then reattach their torso with this string, somehow their core muscles would still function regardless of if the wound heals. They would also be able to perform incredible acrobatic feats as though there was nothing wrong regardless of how extreme their movements. As well even if they had their guts ripped open by a monster thrusting their arm all the way through the string itself would remain undamaged, and not even require any attention. Skill at stitching flesh back together is not required, or even mildly important, just shove it through and so long as it holds the wound together they'll be good to go."
8,,100CP,Specimen Bio-Tank ,Resident Evil,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Well, your B.O.W. specimens have to come from somewhere don't they? They don't just pop out of the ground like those plebeian zombies, and what if you need to make some adjustments? Upon purchasing this, you gain access to a sophisticated bio-tank which is filled with a special fluid. This will not only ensure the B.O.W. is docile and unconscious while immersed, but it also comes with the tools and devices to monitor and make adjustments to the subject inside as needed. Evil laugh not included."
9,,200CP,Are you me? ,Endless Space,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You possess intimate knowledge on Endless cloning technology, and can revive your fallen comrades with some of it. It costs a LOT of Dust, however, and you are not eligible for cloning. The clones are just that, and won't have exact memories or skills, but they will be pretty close to what they were before."
10,,200CP,Augmentation R&D ,Deus Ex Human Revolution,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You have an extensive understanding of the underlying mechanics of DE:HR's cybernetic augmentation architecture; How it works, how it could work, and what avenues to analyse to see if it can be improved - and with time, brand new augmentations. In addition to this, your intelligence is increased to handle such a workload, alongside all the attendant knowledge necessary to mess with the human body - trauma surgery and fixing up broken individuals is an old hat to you, now."
11,,200CP,Biotech ,Marvel Cosmic,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"There are many fields of scientific and engineering expertise. They are all studied and mastered by assorted scientists across the universe. One of the most versatile and powerful fields is that of biotechnology. You are a veritable god in this field. Force evolve creatures at your whim, uplift entirely new species just because. Feel free to create biological interfaces with mechanical devices. The sky's the limit and flesh is your servant."
12,,200CP,Body Shop ,Smash Up,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"A good scientist pushing the bounds of human knowledge always has a use for raw materials. Here is a collection of preserved body parts from every species in the world, updating in future Jumps. Just never ask where it all comes from.
* Extremely useful for any biological projects or research but perk text is slightly concerning if you take it seriously."
13,,200CP,Cradle ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Weapons of war are not the only thing to advance, and this medical bed is proof of that. This human-sized medical device can heal wounds by scanning the wounded area and then regrowing skin tissue to a degree of accuracy that visually one wouldn't be able to tell there was a wound. If improved, there might be a way to let it 'grow' an entire body, but it would take a great degree of medical knowledge to sufficiently do so. There is then the issue of giving it a consciousness; it can create bodies but it cannot create life."
14,,200CP,FormOther Brand Medical Pod ,Hive Queen Quest,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"This medical pod is filled with an odd odorless liquid, when a being is placed inside it goes to work stabilizing and then healing them while simultaneously analyzing and storing information about their biology, which makes it incredibly useful for the study of new species. Large enough to fit a large man, fits more if the specimen has no bones Comes in either Technological or Biotech flavors, both function equally well."
15,,200CP,Grafting | Gourmet Cells ,Toriko,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Grafting (Toriko) (100CP) With the impressive recovery and regenerative abilities of Gourmet Cells, your body can transcend the limits of biology. With this you can now graft human body parts to yourself with a hundred percent success rate and be able to use them effectively. Even more, you can graft the parts of other species and even plants onto your body to gain their abilities though a talented surgeon is still required.
Gourmet Cells (Toriko) (100CP) You acquire either 3 Injections of Gourmet Cells capable of granting Gourmet Cells in a matter of hours or enough Gourmet Pills to grant 3 people Gourmet Cells over the course of a 5 year period through daily ingestion. Injections are a quick way to power up but very few survive the process while Pills have a significantly higher success rate but take time. Acquiring either grants you the ability to harvest Gourmet Cells and create your own Injections and Pills with trial and error. Plants and animals can both be injected or given pills so you may attempt to gather more cells at a later date."
16,,200CP,MEDICAL DOCTORATE ,PREY,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Talos has no shortage of medical assistance, keeping the crew in top physical condition and studying the effects of Neuromods on the human psyche. Almost everyone in the Neuromod department has some medical background. Now you do too, either through your own education or through Neuromod injection. Basic medical supplies work better in your hands, sutures are guaranteed to hold through everything but the harshest of abuse and wounds cleaned by you never get infected. With more advanced supplies you're on par with the world's best heart surgeons. As a bonus, you can also identify and remove organs from the Typhon that are rich in the exotic material used in making Neuromods."
17,,300CP,Cybernetics ,GUNNM,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You have a broad theoretical and practical knowledge of cybernetics and related engineering systems, and can recognize most systems with a glance. The most difficult repairs and programming come naturally to you, custom designs and components that would take an entire research team a month can be jotted down in an hour or so of casual work. The most common form of cyborg in the Scrapyard has an armoured braincase piloting a robotic body, but you're familiar with the organic-inorganic connection technology and can create partial cybernetics as well as organ replacements for those who do not wish to lose their bodies in effect, you are fully capable of the design, construction and application behind the Transhuman and Motorball cyborg perks."
18,,300CP,Make Me A Better Man! ,Franken Fran,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Your skills of surgery do more than heal and correct. You can augment others with superhuman abilities and grant small portions of your power. If supernatural powers can be transferred through physical means, you can do so through surgery."
19,,300CP,Paved In Bones ,The Matrix,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"When one thinks about it, the human body is kind of like a Machine as well. It uses electricity, it requires fuel, it's complex, and it can break down. Why not study it and see what can be done? Whether you sifted through stolen data files or got hands-on with your work, you've figured out a great deal of things about the human body. Its mutations, its limits, its potential... how it all works is open to you, including how the Machines managed to grow their plugs inside the body. What you do with this knowledge is up to you."
20,,300CP,Structural Biology ,Half-Life,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"The anatomy of specimens, both exotic and usual, is key to understanding how they work. You have an instinctive understanding of how living things work, how tough they are, and how interactions between biochemical reactions work."
21,,400CP,4th Imperium Cybernetics ,Empire From The Ashes,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You are a master of the technology that the fourth Imperium used to design its processing systems and AIs, not to mention other civilian systems. You have a complete, total grasp of the techniques used to design everything from fold-space communicators to energy state processors for AIs. You could design the finest computers the 5th Imperium ever found or made from a 21st century resource base."
22,,400CP,Alchemical R&D ,Buso Renkin,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You went down this path of your own free will, and since no one would willingly grant you such amazing powers without a price you had to learn everything yourself. Because of this you know everything there is to know about making homunculus, down to the best place to insert the embryos. That being said, you can't do any of this without a laboratory and whatever DNA you plan on incorporating."
23,,400CP,Arateus Genetics ,Stargate: Atlantis,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You have extensive knowledge of the Arateus bug and its unusual genes, which can be incorporated into human DNA. The sciences of Human/Wraith hybridisation, the retroviruses that can cause or reverse the hybridisation process, and a novice's understanding of their feeding process are yours. This allows you - with the right materials, samples, test subjects and a lab - to create genetic chimeras and bug monsters from Arateus DNA, or cure those who have been transformed thus. Post-jump, you can learn to do the same with other similar biological abominations."
24,,400CP,Bio Lab ,Buso Renkin,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Homunculi don't really breed, so their reproduction is instead linked to creating more of their own. What this purchase does is add a respectable sized laboratory to either your property, or the warehouse, which contains all that you need (including instructions) on how to create basic humanoid and animalistic homunculi."
25,,400CP,Biosynthetics ,Biomega,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Focusing on what science was available, mankind worked towards a harmonious merge of biology and technology - with the ultimate aim of immortality. Well, they're not quite there yet, or at least, the majority of people aren't quite there yet, but they've managed to merge humans with machines very well. Synthetic appendages, weapon prosthesis, modified senses, internal energy generators, and so forth are all rather commonplace in 3005AD. You'll have an intermediate understanding of the science behind biosynthetics, or a boost if you already knew it to begin with."
26,,400CP,Bioweaponry ,Stargate: Atlantis,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"While a prohibited field of study on Earth, it doesn't seem to bother the IOA or SGC if the research is happening in another galaxy or being used on Wraith (who aren't ""technically"" humans). You have the skill to convert virii or bacterial agents into bioweapons, tinker with their virulence and lethality, and design the all-important delivery devices."
27,,400CP,Body of a Servant ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Like a Shoggoth, you can reshape the cells of your body to create any organ you wish, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.  You can also split off and shape your body’s cells/organs into various items that mimic the function of the actual items.  For instance, even if you are normally vulnerable to fire, a frying pan you made with your body would be resistant to heat.  It’s fairly easy to make mundane items using your body, but especially complex items, such as magical artifacts or especially advanced technology, would require a lot more concentration on your part (and maybe a little extra energy) to get things right.  Please also keep in mind that these items are being created from your body mass, so unless you have a way to regenerate your mass you might not want to make too many things at one time."
28,,400CP,Chimeric Fusion ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"With their new forms, beings such as Chimaeras that used to have multiple heads and bodies have fused together into single forms, with one face and one body yet the powers of the different parts combined.  Similarly, you can combine different physical bodies you have into a form that combines different aesthetic qualities of each form and allows you to access all of the abilities normally restricted to the single forms.  However, none of the fused powers from one of the forms will be quite as strong as they would be if you just used that single form.  In addition, you have learned the ancient sorcery used to create Chimaera hybrids by fusing multiple beasts together and enchanting their heart(s) with darkness if they were not already demon beasts.  Furthermore, you can use this magic to also fuse beasts to your body to gain their own special powers.  However, since they are not a natural part of you, the beasts can resist the fusion, with the level of success depending on their willpower and intelligence; even after they fuse to you, their individual personalities will remain intact, and may lead to your mind shifting to their personas now and then.  You can reverse the fusions at any point if you want to."
29,,400CP,Chimerical Genius ,Revelation Space,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"The science of cybernetic augmentation is quite mature in this day and age, and you are at the forefront of combining flesh with machine. The cybernetics you design and install are not only top-of-the-line in terms of their function and performance, but are also very aesthetically pleasing, either matching the contours of the body or in startling contrast. The parts you could build are so durable that they are quite likely to survive long past the person they are attached to: even under such an assault where the flesh is unrecognizable, the chimeric parts you installed would still likely be useable to the degree of being able to install them into another person. You may not be quite at the notorious level of Dr Trintingent, but if you've been a doctor for long, it's likely you have a small following of fans of your work among the chimeric demographic."
30,,400CP,Chrysalis ,Starcraft - The Zerg,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"A human sized, pulsating Chrysalis that.... Looks oddly familiar. Wait, you know why now. This was the same kind of pod that was formed around the one known as Sarah Kerrigan, where abathur remade the Ghost into the Queen of Blades, now it seems you can do the same, any organic subject around the size of an average human will go into a deep sleep when fastened into the Chrysalis, during which you can modify them to a level of detail only seen in individuals like Alexi Stukov. Although you will need the knowledge to properly utilize it, the Chrysalis gives all the benefits of a professional, well-funded surgery room in it's compact organic form."
31,,400CP,Evolutionary Incentive ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"If you have been paying even the slightest bit of attention, you will notice a lot of powers in this multiverse come from the unique biology of different alien species. So naturally, it makes perfect sense to want to harness it and perhaps play with the mechanics a little bit. You are a master of capturing and manipulating DNA using technology, able to mutate creatures into something new by playing with their genetics like play-doh, giving them new powers or even ironing out things like genetic illnesses or defects. You're better at mixing and matching than making anything from scratch, but eventually you can learn how to recreate certain superpowered genetics from one alien species in another using surgery or even small technological devices. You're not quite making the next Omnitrix with this alone, but this definitely sets the foundation for it."
32,,400CP,Genetic Engineering ,World Seed,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"While robots and machines are interesting enough, it would be foolish to think that technology is limited to steel and metal. You have knowledge of a field of technology that goes beyond the conventional. Rather than mechanical engineering, you do genetic engineering. You can grow any technology you could normally create organically instead, and give life to terrors of plants and beasts. Instead of cars you could make reptilian mounts, and instead of hammering together a spaceship you could grow it in orbit. I can't imagine it would be fun to fight against a ship that had a giant row of teeth. But further than that, you could combine the best of these two fields of technology. Machines that heal like organic beings, but a thousand times faster, flesh and scales with the toughness of titanium, and muscles with strength on par with any machine. Robots able to reproduce and propagate like natural lifeforms, and organic brains with the power of the best Artificial Intelligence. I'm sure you can see the potential this offers."
33,,400CP,Genetic Improvements ,Starbound,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Why settle for what Mother Nature gave you? You have the knowledge to tweak and refine genetic code, including your own, bringing out hidden qualities and introducing new ones from other samples. You know how to build the technology needed for these sorts of feats, and have a basic grounding in the appropriate scientific areas."
34,,400CP,Hand of Science ,Anarchy Reigns,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"All we know now is that science reigns supreme. You're a licensed surgeon, specializing in cybernetic implants. With the right tools, you can give someone a cybernetic arm or leg, whether they already had a missing limb or you had to chop one off to make room. On top of that, you know how to weaponize cybernetic limbs as well, and can integrate weapons into them without detracting from their function or aesthetic."
35,,400CP,Implanter ,Empire From The Ashes,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You are a master of this branch of Imperial Technology, being a whiz with the biology, cybernetics and enhancement science needed to design, build and implant the many, many kinds of enhancements that were so common among them.
You start off being able to reliably, indeed excellently, design the Basic Implants that were provided to even the Junior-most fleet officers, soldiers and in the Fifth Imperium, even to ordinary citizens. But as you practice this skill, as you strain your mind, more ideas come to you, revealing more and more advanced designs. Put in some serious work into it, and you could be designing the codes, software and the hardware components typically used by Fleet Captains and Planetary Dukes in no time!
This skill will continue to grow, and you may, with a lot of time and effort, even design implants that could grant sapience to the non-sapient, much as how the scientist Cohanna would use her ability in this art to make ordinary dogs into near-human intelligences."
36,,400CP,M.O. Surgeon ,Terra Formars,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You know the Organic Mosaic Procedure's ins-and-outs like the back of your hand. As a result, you can perform the surgery on anybody, be it human or animal, and they will not need the transformative serum as well. On top of that, while the normal survival rate of the procedure is 35%, your skills with it have increased such a dramatic amount that nine times out of ten, your patient will survive the Procedure."
37,,400CP,Mad Geneticist ,Rick And Morty,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,Sometimes science is more art than science and you find that this is doubly true when it comes to genetics. When you have a vague idea of the attributes you want to impart from a species you find them remarkably easy to splice into a different species. It won't even backfire that often. Probably. Be careful.
38,,400CP,Man and Machine ,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"The line between the two can be blurry in this world, but an engineer of your skills can make it vanish. You're a whiz with cybernetics of all kinds, able to design, build, repair, and even implant them with expert skill. Beyond just making the body embrace these additions as if they were natural if new parts of the whole your expertise allows you to work with and design implants and devices capable of all kinds of things. From in-built cloaking systems, dermal armor able to deflect and ignore military grade arms fire, dash systems, defensive fields, weapons, and much more. You could turn anybody from just another person into a walking example of posthumanity if you had the resources. Your talent in this field ensures you'll be able to adapt any of your technology into some form of useful cybernetic. Who knows where you'll take the field as time goes on."
39,,400CP,Sample Collection ,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Oh, what's this now? Doing some experiments, are we? Well, if you are, these would be priceless. This is a comprehensive collection of DNA samples, with blood, hair, nails and even bone samples from... well, just about everyone who's anyone!
That's right. This is a collection of neatly labeled samples that have materials from very nearly every powerful ninja, samurai, random guy, demon, sage... pretty much anyone who can be considered A-class or above in the Bingo Book. The exact nature and quantity of the samples depends on the people in question and their histories. That is, someone who keeps getting injured would likely have extensive blood samples here, but for someone for whom it's a rarity you would likely see only stuff like hair and skin, and quantities dependant on how easy it tends to ordinarily be to get those things from them.
The exception is for dead people, in which case you get significant quantities of everything from blood, bone, skin... well, everything. Each and every sample is perfectly preserved, and experiments performed on them have significantly higher chances of success than normal. In future jumps too, you get samples from all major figures in the setting, whether in terms of fighting strength, intellect or the rest."
40,,400CP,The Very Model of a Scientist Salarian ,Mass Effect,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You've studied species turian, asari and batarian (and more). You're quite good at genetics (as a subset of biology) because you are an expert (which you know is a tautology). Your xenoscience studies range from urban to agrarian, you are the very model of a scientist salarian. Can sing a little. Little you cannot give insight into due to your vast range of knowledge. Little that you have a hard time getting into due to your vast starting base. You could brute-force the vast majority of ""impossible"" scientific endeavors in this world with your relentless application of logic."
41,,400CP,Xenobiologist ,DOOM 3,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"The denizens of hell are equally terrifying and magnificent, in their own way. You have been extensively trained in the biological sciences, yet even your understanding is merely a starting point for these strange beings. Superhuman strength and resilience, the ability to manifest and control confined plasma charges, teleportation you don't know how they do it. But you will. Your talents grant you immense insight into any biological system, and through study and research, you'll eventually be able to understand even the most bizarre and alien biologies and, with enough skill, even replicate them. Hell is the way forward, and you intend to study it every step of the way.
This Perk grants you a 50CP stipend which you may use in the Mysteries Of Mars or Hell's Might sections found further in this document."
42,,500CP,Commencing Operations ,Franken Fran,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"As an accomplished surgeon, you know the best ways to cut people up and put them back together with a minimum of fuss and damage.
Cosmetics Make people look just like their dreams come true. Grecian perfection? Sure! Picasso's Cubism? Take a number! The only limit is your imagination! (No augments apply)
Transplants Transplant fully functional organs between genders, ages, blood types and species. Biochemical barriers, what's that? Organs must be mostly intact.
Trauma If they're still warm and bleeding, they ain't dead yet. Not when you get your hands on them. I can't say much for their condition, but they will stabilize.
Disease You practically write the book on contagions, lord knows how many you've made. Even knowledge of parasites and poisons won't be far from you. A cure is swift to follow.
Mental Through drugs, surgery, hypnosis and or therapy, the mental scars are as much your domain as anything else. Cure neuroses with year-long processes in mere days or hours, resolve memory loss and even carve personalities and minds to any shape.
* All five are included in the perk cost."
43,,500CP,Fleshcrafting ,Dune,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"The Tleilaxu have thousands of years of knowledge in how to manipulate living forms, whether tinkering with genes outright or through breeding programs, and are able to apply that toward virtually any end with enough time and effort. Using only in-universe tools, you can expect to exercise a great deal of patience in your work, but the abominations that the Tleilaxu keep behind closed doors prove their method. If you were to use more... traditional methods of genetic engineering, coupled with the knowledge given here, you could produce truly remarkable things, whether changing a man into a monster or the pinnacle of human evolution. Even without that, the existence of ghouls (zombie-like killing machines that convert what they kill into more ghouls) and leeches (biological tanks) as well as biomechanical hardware are stark proof of the efficiency of the Tleilaxu gene-forging."
44,,500CP,My Experiments ,Lilo and Stitch,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"The true mark of a Mad Scientist, is the minions under his control. And these children you have created are truly the finest around. You have all the knowledge to build the tools and enact the science, behind creating your own mischievous creatures. The powers they have can range from practically useless, to an unstoppable monstrosity. Their personality is completely up to you. Whilst you have these capabilities, there's a reason they call them experiments. It will take many attempts to work out how to create the exact specimen you want. Even the greatest of scientists may fail 625 times before bringing about their great destroyer. But with enough time and effort, you will eventually gather enough skill in the subject to get the exact creature you want every time."
45,,600CP,Animojo ,Ben 10,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"When it comes to genetics you're one of the best in the universe. Not only can you manipulate the DNA of living things to change them to suit your purpose, but you can even bring long dead species back to life. On top of all this, you also possess the knowledge to build the equipment you need from components you would find at your local electronic and home repair stores."
46,,600CP,Biology As A Guideline ,Franken Fran,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Grow freaky biological monstrosities like pheromone spewing fungi and living theme park mascots. Modify animals into things from mythology. Graft human heads onto animal bodies and vice versa. Create life! With just this you might not be as good as a Madaraki, maybe a Moreau, but you're a convincing substitute."
47,,600CP,Biotechnology ,GUNNM,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"There's really more to cybernetics than just the metal machine. Care has to be taken that the flesh adapts, and there are many lessons to be learned from biological machinery. You're an expert in the fields of genetics, biophysics, toxicology, neuropharmacology and biochemistry the causes and effects of human mutation are very familiar to you. Designer drugs, experimental surgery, toxins, cures improved soft organs and cutting-edge research into cloned nervous system material, with a laboratory the human body is your masterpiece. You may create a variety of drugs similar to that referenced in the Werewolf perk, or directly induce it and Warped as a permanent mutation. If you also have the Cybernetics perk, then with a little time and the right equipment quite difficult to obtain in the Scrapyard you may also apply the equivalent of the TUNED perk to a subject, and have additional knowledge of weapons engineering to reverse-engineer or independently develop most current weapons systems available in the Scrapyard."
48,,600CP,Cobra-La background: Biotechnology ,G.I Joe,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You were born of the nobility of Cobra-La, an ancient civilization that dominated the Earth and retreated to a protective dome during the Ice Age. You left the Dome around the same time Cobra Commander was sent out to try to destroy human civilization. If you take this option Cobra-La will be placed in the Gi Joe setting you went to, and will be an issue at some point. Though probably in a similar vein to the movie, but might be a reoccurring friend/foe. If you join Gi Joe or a drop in and take this option, you are a traitor to your people and can expect a Spore bath if they catch you. If you are a member of Cobra, Cobra Commander takes much of the blame as he did in the movie, and you are not blamed for Cobra's failure. Though Globius might have a low opinion on you depending on how you acted.
Cobra-la biotechnology: You leave Cobra-La with a fairly in depth knowledge of Cobra-La's biotechnology. Its not all comprehensive but will get better in time. As such you can make biological items, weapons, and vehicles equivalent to or surpassing their hard tech counterparts. You can also identify biotech and will have a good idea of how it works and what it does. This would also apply to other Jump's with biotechnology and means you can master those sciences easier. Even truly alien ones. By the time you leave the Jump you can even upgrade humans into bio-soldiers in much the same manner as Cobra-La can, and make truly impressive (also weird and bizarre) biotech."
49,,600CP,Essence Spinner ,Starcraft - The Zerg,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You know the essence and DNA and you know the exact strands with which to induce a variety of mutations and evolutions upon zerg organisms under your control. With a simple feather from a cliff-jumping raptor or the acidic spit from a predatory beetle, you can break down the essence and proteins within each of these to their building blocks and re-assemble them into a strain fit for yourself and your minions. As a bonus, you can produce a simple silk-like screen that allows you to manipulate these strains and magnify them into a view capable of being seen from even a simple human eye. Said silk screen also allows you to manipulate these strands by hand."
50,,600CP,Fleshcrafter ,Claymore,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You know the processes behind the creation of Half Yoma, Abyss Feeders, and even just cobbling together flesh into a rather long lived, and hard to kill body. If it's a secret known to the organization of working flesh anything from humans to Asarakam, you know it all, and can even go beyond in time. You do at least know exactly how to ensure that every half yoma you produce is at a level near the top ranks of warriors within the organization. With a little effort you could find a way to produce them without a stigma, or create ones that don't show their nature through bleaching their body of pigment and turning their eyes silver."
51,,600CP,Go To Hel ,Kamen Neo-Heisei Rider Part 2.5 - Gaim,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"It would appear you have happened across an oddly fertile patch of Helheim. Any seeds you plant here will grow into Helheim plants that produce Lockseeds of the source of the seeds. You could even try crossbreeding the resulting plants to create Lockseeds that grant armaments based on a mix of the two donor plants. While this can get you some very potent Lockseeds, keep in mind it won't necessarily scale directly with the fruits, and something on the level of the Forbidden Fruit would take ages of effort and many unusual fruits to even begin to approach it. After the jump, this patch becomes attached to your Warehouse, giving you a stable Helheim patch free of Invess except any you make."
52,,600CP,Genius of Osakabe ,Arpeggio of Blue Steel,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You are privy to the secrets of Professor Osakabe, the creator of the Design Children. This skill in genetics allows you to create 'test-tube babies' from donor samples and genetically enhance them for specific traits most notably, their intelligence, memory retention, creativity, intuition and reasoning. Such children have the potential to change the nation maybe even the world before they so much as hit puberty, far surpassing the intellect of any natural human and coming up with creative schemes that the Fog could never imagine. Please use this talent carefully even the brilliant professor himself was unable to prevent more than a fraction of 'his' children from dying, and that nearly destroyed him. I hope, for your sake and theirs, that you are able to iron out any flaws in the process."
53,,600CP,Greenfinger ,Starbound,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You have a great power, the ability to commune with and control any and all forms of plant life. Beyond even that, however, is your ability to grow plants under your control which can mimic the effects of technology. You need some understanding of the underlying principles, but once you have that, organic teleporters, plasma weapons, spaceships, and more are all possibilities.
These technologies can retain benefits of their plant-like origin, including photosynthesis, regeneration, and other plant-based attributes."
54,,600CP,Guardian Angel ,Overwatch,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Doctor Angel Zieger, also known as Mercy, was renowned as an unparalleled medical genius even in her teens, being recruited to the medical division of Overwatch before she was even 18 and becoming the head of a hospital even before that. Her medical skills have literally brought the dead back to life and her technology is so advanced that it seems like magic. there is no one in the world able to even compare to her in her area of expertise. No one, that is, save for you. Your base medical knowledge is encyclopedic, your hands are almost mechanically accurate when performing surgery. Your technology is advanced to almost impossible standards, including things such as a staff that can engage a healing stream to rapidly regen people from a distance. Your knowledge may even allow you to slow the rate of aging"
55,,600CP,Making Monsters ,Pokemon Sword and Shield,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Although incredible, the study of fossils and their revival isn't exactly a new field of research. There is someone in Galar making what some would call a breakthrough, and others would call crimes against nature, relating to the field. Would you like to become a genius? On purchase, you will acquire a wealth of information relating to fossil revival technologies, such as what the process of fossil revival entails and how the technology works. In a more expansive step however, comes the knowledge on methods for splicing pre existing life forms into something new. Although most of your expertise in that second field comes from using fossil revival on partial fossils of different creatures to revive them as something strange and new, you also have some knowledge on doing that through other means, though mostly as a starting point. In addition to just being able to make such things, you're somehow quite skilled with making sure this hybrid lifeform has the strengths and qualities of its parts, in spite of how unlikely it should be for such things to even survive, much less thrive. Maybe that will help others ignore your depraved acts."
56,,600CP,MASTER OF THE MIND ,PREY,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"The knowledge to create Neuromods. We're not just talking about those hypos with exotic material either, but to be able to create the programs that you upload to the mind itself. With this, all the secrets of the human mind are laid bare to you, if you look at an active neuron you could tell what it's function is in the mind. You can take the scans the specific skills of anyone and create a new Neuromod suitable for human use. Skills can be recorded through mere observation utilising a device called a Psychoscope, though the skill you wish to collect must be being practiced by the target or be a significant part of their personality. A great musician doesn't need to be composing in order for you to scan him for his musical talent, but if you wanted his ability to cook you'd need to scan him while he was cooking. It has also been demonstrated to be possible to install abilities from alien biology, providing the user has access to sufficient quantities of any special material the ability relies on and they're okay with hybridising their biology with the species."
57,,600CP,Noetic Science ,Trinity: Aeon,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You have engaged in a deep, in-depth study of the mechanics behind your new abilities. You are considered an expert among the orders on the nature of both the Noetic universe, and to a lesser degree, the effects of Taint on the world. You also have enough knowledge of the biological sciences that you could modify or design new biotech, though you're still a long way from understanding the Prometheus chambers. The Tesser drives that power the interstellar teleportation Modes built into the Leviathan Jumpships are a little beyond you, but you'll figure them out with a few more years of study. Perhaps you could design other kinds of biotech with limited Psi powers?"
58,,600CP,Paraphysician ,Trinity: Aberrant,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Rashoud facilities around the world are ready to take in newly-erupted Novas and teach them how to use their powers. Training typically involves biofeedback exercises, practical lessons within shielded labs, and a crash course in quantum physics. After joining Utopia you continued your studies and acquired several degrees, eventually becoming a licensed Paraphysician. Through observation and testing you can develop ways to quantify and categorize the mechanics of how individuals access superhuman powers. While you won't instantly understand the hows and whys behind a power, it's easy for you to create training methods to ease and speed the development of these powers and design chemicals and equipment to mitigate any side-effects that those powers may have. As a side note, you've mastered the skills of Dormancy and Attunement to a degree that most Novas never will and can easily teach these skills to other Novas."
59,,600CP,Personal Analysis ,E.V.O. Search for Eden,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"You possess an innate and intricate understanding of the natural processes of your form, whatever those might be, down to the sub-atomic level. This means you have an incredible understanding of things like your body chemistry, cellular activity, and much more. This extends to forms in your Record of Evolution, letting you examine and understand them in incredible detail as well. Also excellent in diagnosing any health issues or damage you've sustained, or guiding your evolution with a precision that would be impossible otherwise."
60,,600CP,The Flesh is Strong ,Hive Queen Quest,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"The hive thrives on the strength of its parts, every drone born for a specific job, every life a cog in the mighty machine working for the good of all, all serving the queen. Through long hours of research (and the hard work of your thinkers) you have learned to assimilate not only the tools of nature to add to your drones strength but also the tools of others. With study you can replicate machinery as biotech, studying a vibrating blade powered by servos for instance may allow you to recreate it by growing a chitinous blade powered by micro muscles while studying a ships blink drive may allow you to grow your own out of hundreds of interlocking ""cog"" drones. As a plus should you be a queen you can apply these changes to your children before you lay their egg, altering their form as you see fit to grant them the boons of technology and nature from birth."
61,,600CP,Virology ,Prototype,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Looking at it from a technical standpoint, viruses are just devices that carry genes, they enter the nucleus, insert their genome, and then the host cell does everything else for them. This characteristic makes viruses one of the most favored devices in genetic engineering, as they can go and infect multiple cells. The folks at Gentek know this, and focus solely on them, but you have a leg up on them. By extensive study (but still far less than a computer could) you can decode the entire genome of a life-form, and decode and isolate the genes responsible for any and every trait that they possess. Want the eyes of a goat on the body of a snake? Or possibly just the strength of a rhinoceros? Do not look away, study and decode today!"
62,,800CP,The Science of Evolution ,E.V.O. Search for Eden,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Theory? To you evolution is an entire scientific field in it's own right, one you have more than mastered. From the how, to the why, to mathematics to quantify and calculate it, to the crystals and other devices to manipulate and interact with it, to even the quantum physics that influence it at the smallest levels of reality. This knowledge is essentially the complete and collected data from all of the evolution that has taken place on Earth, up to the birth of civilization. The question is, what will you do with this knowledge? While the bulk of it relates to biological evolution, it'd only take a little effort on your part to apply this to the evolution of non-biological systems, such as computer viruses or society."
63,,900CP,Karma Chameleon ,GUNNM,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Your biology isn't content to just sit around and wait for the next generation to surpass it. A constant internal struggle, a genetic hothouse under your skin - writhing tests of new muscle fibres, skin weaves, neuron insulation, circulatory system innovations your body is constantly tweaking and advancing itself to better fit with the demands placed upon it. This isn't just reactive evolution, though it is that - it's the brute-force computation of a billion tiny computers, a constant drive to exploit every advantage. While it's very slow, you may find yourself growing internal electroreceptors when your cells notice that most of the really dangerous things around you have EM signatures, or find your dietary preferences shifting to include metals and silicon to reinforce your bones and slowly hybridise into a truly biological robot. When you do actually struggle and fight and bleed, this process is sped up by an order of magnitude in the course of a single fight you might find your blood incorporating foaming clotting agents, or your eyes and visual cortex adapting to cyborg-speed combat. You can ultimately develop any biological ability you want, though whether you get it is based on your cleverness in providing the right evolutionary pressures - you might want a secondary heart and end up with none at all. Additionally, while results never really cease, they tend to plateau when you cannot actually challenge yourself meaningfully in life-or-death situations. Any other biological powers that you have benefit from this as well, constant tweaks and adaptations that may not be quite what you expect, but always fulfil a purpose."
64,,1000CP,Botanist | Genius,Plants Vs Zombies,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Botanist (600CP) Ah, come on, you knew this perk was coming. You are an amazing botanist now. Not only do you have a comprehensive grasp of botany in the real world, but you also gain an extremely rapid understanding of plants of all types just by looking at them once. You can tell what their best conditions of growth are, how they could be enhanced and improved, all sorts of things. You're also able to modify them, rather extensively at that. You have a talent for designing plants, making incredibly beautiful or sturdy versions, or even both.
Genius Boosted: You skills with plants are now the equal of David Blazing himself! You can design plants for all sorts of purposes now, including things no one has any business using plants for. Biology, the Laws of Physics or Common Sense, nothing can stop in your way as you grant frankly ridiculous powers to your creations. You could design Chillies that explode, Squashes that Squash enemies, or Cherries that Explodonate. More than this, you're more than capable of giving them full and complete Sapience, so much so that they could go to college, even.
Genius! (400CP) You are an absolute Genius, with this perk! Your mind works tens, hundreds of times as fast as even the most clever of your fellows, excepting the true once-in-a-millennium genii like the one or two people in this world. You have an eidetic memory, and absolutely perfect recall, making sure you never forget anything. More than that, you are capable of wonders of science that would leave anyone around you gaping in awe. Creating sapience is child's play, as is working with both Trees and Plants or human flesh, letting you make wonders and abominations. While you're rather far from being able to make things like either the Plants or Zombies used here, you could learn very quickly indeed, being clever as you are. This perk is a capstone booster for each Origin capstone, and the interactions are listed with the capstones.
* Subtract 400 from the cost if you already have the genius! Perk from Defender"
65,,1500CP,Keeper: Forger of Giants: Enchanted ,Azeroth,Domain: Crafting: Biotech,"Your talents of craft extend to the direct creation and modification of living beings. You have the ability to craft life itself. While you cannot make life from nothing, you can harness any source of life or spirit to create a soul for a living being. Without a source you may still make complicated facsimiles of life similar to A.I. and or elementals. You may forge, re-forge, temper, purify, and heal any kind of mind, spirit, body, or soul cleaning it of corruption, deterioration, disease, tarnish, blemish or error, strengthening it against harm or others interference. While you do have the ability to do the same to even yourself, it will take a great deal of time or power, as you were crafted by the titans themselves and already tempered to such an extent to be able to wage war against the corrupting and chaotic forces of the old gods and elementals. Your ability to craft and uplift bodies and souls allows you to create races up to a similar power and form as the Mogu, Tol'vir, Iron Vrykul, Earthen, and Giants. You have the ability to resurrect any being weaker than yourself into its original body or into a new body up to a form you could create, as long as a beings, mind, spirit, soul hasn't been captured or restrained you can resurrect it freely, even if its essence is being restrained. You have the ability to transition between the realms of the living and the dead, attack incorporeal beings with physical matter and even if a soul is destroyed as long as you can find even a fragment of it or the being that destroyed it you can use the fragment or shatter the destroyers soul to re-forge the original soul, you may need a source of life or spirit to rebuild it as if creating a new soul from scratch"
