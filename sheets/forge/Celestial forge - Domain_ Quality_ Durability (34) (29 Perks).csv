1,,100CP,The Honed Edge ,Pocky & Rocky,Domain: Quality: Durability,"With just a bit of time and polish you can restore any blade to its true sharpness, as if it were just crafted. Rust and tarnish to away with ease as well. Your tools and weapons are always in the best shape. SOME effort does need to be put into this care of course."
2,,100CP,Whether There's Weather ,Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Quality: Durability,"If you built or designed it, it's weatherproof. What kind of weather? Yes. Snow, scorching heat, pouring rain, vacuum, hail, all sorts of weather. If a human could survive a while without a spacesuit, you tech will keep working. And maybe it'll keep working even if a human couldn't."
3,,200CP,Brush Guard ,Generic Zombie Apocalypse,Domain: Quality: Durability,Your equipment or vehicles will never be damaged or have its functionality impaired due to being used as a weapon against organic targets.
4,,200CP,Crude and Tough ,Warframe SB,Domain: Quality: Durability,"While Grineer technology is ugly and primitive compared to their rivals, they are undoubtedly effective, rugged and easily produced. The latter is true for creations of your craft. Anything you make is both durable and tough, able to take a beating and function in the harshest of environments while being viable for mass production."
5,,200CP,Designing for the Armageddon ,Empire from the Ashes,Domain: Quality: Durability,"Is a valuable skill, to those who understand such things. You have a certain gift, my friend. Whenever interacting with any kind of system, you have a preternatural understanding for designing things to be impossibly rugged and long-lasting. Be it computers, machines or even institutions, you always know the right redundancies, designs and methodologies to use, resulting in systems that can stand the test of time almost indefinitely. They might not rise very much further by themselves with just this, but anything you have a hand in creating will last for veritable aeons, practically indefinitely unless someone specifically and deliberately acts to destroy them, and even then they'd have excellent odds of surviving."
6,,200CP,ELDER TECHNOLOGY ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Quality: Durability,"Some civs just build to last, and it is not unusual for Sublimed civs to leave considerable artifacts behind. Any technological device, structure or vehicle that you create has an effectively unlimited usable lifespan. Not even organic matter that is a part of the device will decay, or even undergo effects like proton decay over the aeons. They will still need expendable reserves a gun still needs bullets, a laser still needs its power pack replaced or recharged but that gun's moving parts never wear out, and that rechargeable power pack can be reused for aeons and more without loss of performance."
7,,200CP,German Engineering ,Smash Up,Domain: Quality: Durability,"Everything you build seems just a bit more. More durable, more efficient, more precise. Call it a 10-20% difference across the board?"
8,,200CP,Mythril Coating ,Final Fantasy Dissidia,Domain: Quality: Durability,"In many realms throughout the rift, mythril has always been an element of reputable worth. With the powers of the rift however, this mythril coating has been charged somewhat. Able to be applied onto both weapons and armor, items coated with this will be constantly charged with magical energy. As a consequence of this, the affected item allows one to sustain energy draining forms for twice as long, and improves their power slightly."
9,,200CP,Reliable Invention ,Kim Possible,Domain: Quality: Durability,Anything you construct is only broken when used improperly or purposefully targeted with attacks. The items you create do not malfunction and are completely resistant to damage caused by regular usage.
10,,200CP,Technical Knock ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Quality: Durability,"You have mastered the ancient technical rite of 'if it doesn't work, smack it with a wrench until it does.' Small problems like loose gears can be quickly and permanently fixed with one good whack. When a larger problem impedes a machine's function, continuous pounding and irate prayer can cajole it to miraculously perform one last, brief task, but no more. At that point, this rite will have no more effect until the device receives proper attention."
11,,200CP,Tinker ,Generic Builder,Domain: Quality: Durability,"You have a knack for creating things with complex moving parts that don't break down given 'normal' wear and tear. Toys could last generations with just a little care, a roller-coaster wouldn't break down unless someone sabotaged it or it was struck by lightning or some other external force."
12,,300CP,Built to Last,Assassin's Creed,Domain: Quality: Durability,"Whatever you personally build, be it handheld or architectural, becomes nigh-impervious to weather, rust and time. If it gets lost or buried, you can 'feel' it out too!"
13,,300CP,Built to Last,Stargate Atlantis,Domain: Quality: Durability,"You probably took the saying if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well a little too closely to heart. You could build a city to last tens of thousands of years at full functionality or a battery that keeps its unused charge indefinitely. Mere time and weather will not erode your monuments, and your devices may lie dormant for eons, ready to reawaken at any time. It's up to you whether this is due to glowy space crystals (ahem, advanced materials science knowledge) or something stranger."
14,,300CP,Robust Engineering ,Dune,Domain: Quality: Durability,"Ten thousand years of stagnation in technology is a very long time... and now you know how to apply the lessons of those millennia to the construction of anything you have. Mass production does not exist any longer and even relatively common items are made as if masterwork quality, because aside from obvious cheap items, they have been built to last longer than the person using them. Expect anything you construct by hand to be able to last centuries, as long as you take a little extra time while you make it. With the amount of time you're going to be around... you may need that sort of quality."
15,,400CP,A Monument to Time Itself ,Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings,Domain: Quality: Durability,"You built things to last. A monument to death that itself dies may have a certain appeal to more philosophical sorts but you wanted your monuments to last for eternity, so that everyone would look upon them and know the glories that your mind had wrought. What objects or structures you create, by your own hand or by your direction, will last forever. The passage of time and the environment around it will not degrade it or damage it or destroy it. Even blows against it, attempts to demolish what you have made, will see their blades break long before the stone you laid down does. Your creations are imbued with supernatural durability, though they will not last forever or be protected against anything, they will be proof against mere mortals trying to defile your art."
16,,400CP,Armsthrift ,Fire Emblem: Awakened,Domain: Quality: Durability,Your weapons just don't seem to break and you know how to care for them well. Even immensely fragile things are unlikely to break in your care. Guns won't jam and swords never lose their edge
17,,400CP,Built to Last ,Nexus 2.0,Domain: Quality: Durability,"The things you create are much more resilient than they otherwise would be, requiring far less maintenance to keep in good condition and functional. This even applies to larger projects, such as buildings and farms, or more esoteric creations, such as Seeds for Seed Sorcery. On top of this, anything you build is simply built better, a sword will hold a sharper edge, armor will resist more damage, a cart will have a smoother ride, and much more."
18,,400CP,Chimerical Genius ,Revelation Space,Domain: Quality: Durability,"The science of cybernetic augmentation is quite mature in this day and age, and you are at the forefront of combining flesh with machine. The cybernetics you design and install are not only top-of-the-line in terms of their function and performance, but are also very aesthetically pleasing, either matching the contours of the body or in startling contrast. The parts you could build are so durable that they are quite likely to survive long past the person they are attached to: even under such an assault where the flesh is unrecognizable, the chimeric parts you installed would still likely be useable to the degree of being able to install them into another person. You may not be quite at the notorious level of Dr Trintingent, but if you've been a doctor for long, it's likely you have a small following of fans of your work among the chimeric demographic."
19,,400CP,Form & Function ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain: Quality: Durability,"A while back, you overheard something your customers had said - about cloth and leather being insufficient to protect them out in the wilderness of Eorzea. You have to admit that they do have a bit of a point. Cloth and leather might be far more comfortable than a suit of plate armor, but functionally they protect substantially less. But maybe if you could use a different material, things might be different?
The principle of this weave is the same as when you made inner linings. But whereas inner linings allowed you to split open layers in order to weave enchantments and magic inside, now you have folded layer upon layer with inlaid crystals to attain a weave that can withstand blows just as well as a suit of plate might. The amount of crystals you need for the process is substantial - but the magic is ultimately necessary, so that you don't leave a single imperfection which may ruin the final product, and also so that it doesn't end up looking bulky and cumbersome.
Objects that you craft with the same principle exhibit durability several times stronger than what you would have expected from an equivalent of similar weight."
20,,400CP,Made of Nintendium ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Durability,"Nintendium, the master material, the adamantium of the gaming world! Exaggeration it might be, you do make people guess twice with how physically durable your creations are. Your consoles could survive being dropped from the top shelf, your phones could be stepped on without issue. Heck, taking a sledgehammer to something made by you might even leave something salvageable, if you put enough work in. Oh, was that not mentioned? The more time you spend designing something, the more durable you'll be able to make it without too much of a limit."
21,,400CP,Never Goes Out Of Style ,Honor Harrington,Domain: Quality: Durability,"Sometimes old technology is not quite as irrelevant as people would like to think it is. Fission can be useful in the far future, and ground combat is never quite completely irrelevant. You have an incredible talent for finding new uses for old technology. Things you build are incredibly robust and resilient, while remaining extremely adaptable and amenable to being modified to suit new purposes. One thing the Graysons excelled in was environmental systems to stave off the harshness of their world's environment. You have an excellent working knowledge of their design, production, and maintenance. One might even develop domed cities."
22,,400CP,Plague Hardening ,Revelation Space,Domain: Quality: Durability,"In the years post-Melding, much of the advanced technology of the Belle poque has been set aside due to the risk of infection with Melding Plague spores. Where once glittering near-autonomous volantors streaked through Chasm City's skies, now steam- and battery-driven cars grind along its streets. Where buildings could be grown from a seed and altered at their owner's whims, now they must be painstakingly built with labor. You, however, have developed strains of plague-hardened nanotech. Any advanced technology you build is vastly more resistant to the ever-evolving Melding Plague and similar viral and infectious agents which seek to subvert it, lasting for days or weeks of direct exposure before succumbing when a similar unprotected machine might fail in minutes or seconds. And when your technology's defenses are finally broken, it 'petrifies', dumbing down its present form and function rather than growing wild and further spreading the plague; able to continue being used for a more limited application rather than failing outright. For example, an infected fabricator might reduce its construction resolution to components larger than one millimeter, losing its ability to produce micro-scale items but still able to be used, rather than churning out a froth of contagious plague spores."
23,,600CP,Applied Phlebotinum ,Honkai Impact Third,Domain: Quality: Durability,"You see that dumb dangerous energy over there? Yeah. You can build your machines to harness it. Most of the time. You're a master of unconventional sources of power for your devices, and the weirder and more dangerous it is, the stronger the resulting power is. If you could somehow hook a Herrscher into your generators you'd substantially amplify their power output to the point you could probably use a single one to make a continent destroying weapon. Just beware of the potential Phlebotinum breakdown. Please don't put any big red self destruct buttons on it."
24,,600CP,Extended Warranty ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Quality: Durability,"Let's get real for a second: You are a scientist, not a repair monkey. You shouldn't have to teleport all the way from your home planet to fix something one of your assistants managed to break in the time you took your eyes off of them. As a result, your technology is now durable and long-lasting...you can go years without seeing a prototype of your creation before it actually needs you to fix it directly, even the most idiotic and primitive species being able to guesswork how to fix it even if they don't know how it works. Also when I say durable, I mean the universe could collapse into nothingness and that device of yours would still be floating in the empty void that used to be said universe. Point being, technology you create is both insanely durable and is easily maintained. Now maybe you don't have to handle everything yourself."
25,,600CP,Failess Mode ,Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Quality: Durability,"When you design equipment or machinery, you make sure that it's designed properly. Your designs are far more resilient against failure than they would otherwise be, only completely failing when critical components are outright destroyed. Chain reactions where failure of one component leads to another failing are uncommon, and really can't happen by accident. More importantly, every failure mode is a safe failure mode. You could make an antimatter storage container that wouldn't auto-annihilate if power failed."
26,,600CP,Lost Arts ,World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection,Domain: Quality: Durability,"The Cabiri form of the Great Rite would appear and disappear, be destroyed and appear again no matter how hard Horus tried. Now your works are similarly hard to erase. Any of your creations, from writings to paintings to swords are immune to the ravages of time and have a mysterious luck of their own. This luck causes your creations to avoid destruction time and time again though all kinds of contrivances and circumstances."
27,,600CP,Performance Optimization ,Ragnarok Online,Domain: Quality: Durability,"Every adventurer has seen their weapons start to degrade and eventually it ends in a trip to the blacksmith with their weapons broken. For a Blacksmith, it only takes so many weapons before they would come to consider What if we could make a weapon perform well regardless of what condition was it in? Reaching a breakthrough was a matter of reworking what Blacksmiths already had. Rather than looking to boost the performance cap of a weapon, Blacksmiths looked instead to boost the performance lifespan: Concluding with the creation of a spell which will keep the weapon intact regardless of physical and magical trauma for as long as it is maintained."
28,,600CP,Steamflogger of the Century ,MtG - Bablovia,Domain: Quality: Durability,"You are one of the greatest riggers the plane has ever seen. You assemble contraption like it was nothing, building one crazy machinery after the other. More often than not, your contraptions are so sophisticated that even despite using sub par material, these machines will never stop working. Also, you have a knack for building contraptions that build new contraptions themselves. Just don't cause them to take over the world by accident!"
29,,600CP,The Test of Time ,World of Darkness - Demon the Fallen,Domain: Quality: Durability,"Whether it was your job to place a single type of gem within the soil, to create a certain mineral, or to carve mountains that reach the sky, your works were never meant to deplete. Change form, perhaps, but never lessen from what they were. You remember the secrets of creation you once wielded long ago. When you create something from raw materials with your own hands and infuse it with your Faith, it becomes something far more than what it is. Though a sword will bend, it will never shatter. Though it may burn white with heat, it will never melt. What is that sword-shaped thing in that black hole? Your work of art, of course! As long as there is no automation or outside assembly, anything you create becomes infused with divine might and will never wear or break. A leather jacket you made an animal's hide might be able to catch a sabot round, but that does not mean it won't splatter the person wearing it."
