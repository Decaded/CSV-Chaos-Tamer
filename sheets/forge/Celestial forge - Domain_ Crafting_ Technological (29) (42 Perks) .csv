1,,100CP,Bandit Gunsmith ,Borderlands,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You have amazing technical insight and when shown a pile of broken weapons or energy shields you can use parts from some to reassemble others into decent condition. Don't expect it to be pretty, but you can nail 15 repeater pistols together to make a functional shotgun, or use bits of five shields to make one that works."
2,,100CP,Big Bada-Boom ,Azeroth,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You may not make the prettiest of engineering gizmos, but boy do you know how to make them go BOOM! You can make big bombs or little bombs or big bombs IN little bombs capable of taking out an entire skyscraper. You are an expert at bomb crafting, able to make bombs the size of a marble that would make even Deathwing flinch. This also extends to defusing bombs if, for some reason, you don't want a boom, but that's just crazy talk."
3,,100CP,Gunsmith ,Alpha Protocol,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"People always forget that all Guns need some sort of maintenance, thankfully unlike other people you know and can easily maintain as well as repair almost any modern gun, and you also have a solid basis for learning how to maintain and repair or customize almost any gun that you can get your hands on, in fact your skill right now is good enough that you can at least ensure that whatever gun you clean up and maintain personally will never jam for whatever reason, who knows what you will be able to do in the future."
4,,100CP,Hammer Jammer ,MtG - Bablovia,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Sometimes, all you need is a hammer. You've become insanely good at all sorts of Do-it-Yourself work and inventing gadgets, even with unusual parts. They might seem crude and useless from the outside, but the contraptions you invent do their job just fine. You also become good at repairing things, there's nothing you and your hammer can't fix."
5,,100CP,Laboratory Work ,IOU,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Given a few hours and suitable tools you can almost always come up with a set of disposable tools that will counter a given gadget or ability you've encountered in the past. It'll only work once or twice, but with good sense that might be all you need."
6,,100CP,Tool King ,Modded Fallout,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Starting with a cartload of random junk and ending with high-quality ammunition or power cells, cutting-edge improvements to power armor, overcharged laser weaponry or even entirely new kinds of science is practically trivial for the average Fallout protagonist yet their talents pale compared to yours. This Perk grants you immediate access to pretty much any kind of crafting shown in the Fallout series: from Hand Loader to Science! and Chemist to Robotics Expert, if it somehow involves building things out of other things (from guns to ammo to even entire buildings), you've got it - including perfectly memorized designs for the kind of components and tools you might need, like the Robotics Workbench or Nuka-Cola Mixer station. In fact, you're good enough that you'll never make mistakes while doing this type of crafting (assuming someone doesn't start shooting at you or some such), and you'll be perfectly aware of where you were in the process if you do find yourself interrupted and have to continue later on."
7,,200CP,Connector ,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Switches and wiring may seem rather simple on the surface, but there is a host of complexity lurking just under the surface. After all, these skills were why the Mechanic was kidnapped, to help with rebuilding the lost body parts of the Moon Lord for his cult. You are not quite at that level yet, but you do now have a large amount of skill in designing networks and working out how to bring all of the moving parts together to create something greater. Actuators, sensors, conveyors and more, you can construct extremely complex mechanisms and arrange location and timing so that they all work together smoothly. Eventually, it is entirely possible that you could develop plans for building things like the Mechanical Bosses."
8,,200CP,Enhanced I.C. Chip ,Mega Man Classic,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You know how to create stronger I.C. chip, these chips from the core of a robots personality, it's memory and the likes. Stronger chips are less fragile and less susceptible to reprogramming. Any sapient machine you make will retain their own personality, even though virus attacks and so long as the chip remains intact, they can outlive their body."
9,,200CP,Fingers of the North Star ,Cave Story,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You have a natural talent with machinery, and this extends to firearms creation. You can disassemble, analyze, and reassemble any projectile weapon you come across, and you have the ability to create unique, one of a kind guns that utilizes odd and esoteric technology. You also gain a free 'stamp' you can apply to any weapon you create, to show it's your work. Upgrading existing weapons is a breeze as well."
10,,200CP,Legendary Craftsman ,Modded Fallout,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Remember all those unique prototype weapons with crazy awesome effects? The Legendary items in Fallout 4? The games have had their fair share of 'better than normal' items, and you know just how to make them. You have the ability to substantially improve whatever items you work on, needing at most enough components to build a second copy of the item in question. Whether it's dumping half your power cell into each shot a la Pew-Pew, making every bullet fired by your Minigun into an explosive round, or crafting armor that boosts your stats with no regard for how or why it works, you've got it all. Never again will you need to worry about being unable to find that Two-Shot or Instigating Gauss Rifle! You'll even be able to (slightly) fudge where those unique effects could be found, like making Power Armor with special effects or a Gatling Laser that does fire explosive rounds. Beams. Whatever."
11,,200CP,Maliwan Intern ,Borderlands,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"At some point, you got lucky and figured out how Elemental Weapons really work. You know how to use them to best effect, allowing you to set enemies on fire regularly, melt people with acid bullets, and have ALL kinds of shocking adventures with electrical ammo. If you have any technical training, you can even jury-rig ways to apply elemental effects to other weapons, as well."
12,,200CP,Rotary Slug Thrower ,Smash Up,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Those aren't usually automatic you have a gift for rapid-firing weapons, and modifying weapons to fire faster. Never enough dakka."
13,,200CP,The Love of Lightning ,Fate/Grand Order,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Steam Power! Coal! Electricity! The Nuclear Age! All the greatest revolutionaries have brought new power with them, their obsessions letting them take great bounds over the opposition to advance all of humanity. You share that same potential with one form of technological power, greatly advancing your skill and potential when dealing with technology that uses it. It could be electricity powered tech, steam powered tech or even wind powered tech. Whatever you choose, you'll be able to make them much stronger, much more efficient and much cheaper than you normally could. Not all energies are exactly equal however, so you may still find yourself needing more resources than normal, though you'd still get the increased power and efficiency."
14,,200CP,Weapon crafting ,Devil May Cry,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Alright, so you fancy yourself a weapons dealer, huh? Well now you know the ins and outs of every single tool made for killing that you get your crafty little hands on. Swords, handguns, axes, sniper rifles, spears, rocket launchers, it'll all come naturally to you, and you will be able to create these weapons or even improve them with your own custom designs. And to make it even a better deal, you know how to modify a weapon to have unlimited ammunition capability. So go nuts, buddy. You've earned it."
15,,300CP,Adventurous Engineering ,Van Helsing,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You know the ins, outs, secrets, and quirks of the technology inherent in this age. As a result, you can engineer just about anything that will run on electricity, from a horseless carriage to the ever-powerful Tesla-Coil Cannon. You just need the parts, which shouldn't be hard to come by... Right? A quirk of Adventurous Engineering is that your technology always gains a bit of a Victorian flair to it."
16,,300CP,Gadgeteer ,Young Justice,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"An inventive mind and the know how to make gadgets; though they can't do anything too outside of normal physics, you are perfectly capable of making functional things like grappling hooks, tracking devices, boomerangs that automatically return to you, and trick arrows. In addition to being very cheap to make, any gadgets that you have are almost as intuitive to use as your very limbs, allowing you to use and switch between them easily and without hassle."
17,,300CP,High-Frequency Manufacturer ,Metal Gear Rising,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"A blade launderer, huh? Anyway, you can now make a HF blade out of anything you want. Depending on the original craftsmanship of the weapon, it could be good or shit. But if you picked this, you probably have something in mind. Must be a physical object. No lightsabers and the like. Yes, blunt objects can become HF weapons. No, they can't cut. They only get stronger, and can resist other HF weapons."
18,,300CP,I Can Fix It! ,Reborn,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Technology is a wonderful thing, and you discovered that long ago. You have a knack for Flame rings and machines of all kinds, and can fix or maintain most machines. You can even improve them to beyond their normal specs. Comes with its own toolbox."
19,,300CP,Mechanist ,Fallout 4,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You know what makes robots tick or beep. Not only can you repair and create them from scratch, but you can also cobble them together, creating some sort of robotic Frankenstein's Monster that's loyal to you and you alone while also incorporating all of the best components of the robots it's made."
20,,300CP,Robotics ,The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Making robots and sentient AI is almost second nature to you, with the ease that you create them with. You also have knowledge of robotics in general, and can easily disable or hack one if you can access its software."
21,,400CP,Armored Jumper ,The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You've got the know-how to create suits of power armor more along the lines of Crimson Dynamo in terms of size, though with much higher quality. Actually powering the armor is a bit trickier, as you lack the ability to make Arc Reactors with this alone, but it's possible that you can make an equivalent- or even run the armor off of something else entirely. With Sleek and Efficient, your armors can be closer to Tony Stark's in size."
22,,400CP,Clockwork Artist ,Hellboy,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Kroenen is said to have created a clockwork bird capable of singing Mozart in his earlier days, though the assassin's love of music is less well known than the fear he inspired later in life. He is now more well known for his other clockwork inventions- namely his hand, and the clockwork mechanisms spread throughout his body that when wound up give the man his deadly strength, speed, and reflexes. You are capable of creating similar mechanical inventions, though you may lack the ability to self-modify to his extent without his love of pain and lack of blood."
23,,400CP,Game-breaking Union ,Modded Fallout,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Mods are such funny things, change a few numbers here, tweak a few values there, and before you know it you've got miniguns that fire low-yield nukes and other such madness. Well, mad you may be, but it's certainly not weak. You have the strange and imposing ability to make modifications to your gear in ways that well, really shouldn't be. You're still limited to what you'd normally be able to build, but any kind of sensible limits on what kind of item the upgrades apply to goes right out the window. Attach jetpacks to your helmet, fire .308 cal armor-piercing rounds from a lightweight SMG with no penalties to its performance, and yes - install a MIRV Fat Man mod onto your Minigun and (somehow) blanket the world in nuclear annihilation at a rate of about thirty mushroom clouds per second or so. Might wanna put that Power Armor plating in your underwear first though"
24,,400CP,Gimme a Tic ,Gonna be the Twin-Tail,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"They ain't never seen an engineer like yourself. You're not just able to keep up with some of the best and brightest in this world, such as creating teleporters that can be carried in your palm or energy shields that can offset a rocket launcher yet are contained within small pieces of jewellery, but you are also able to outright make what you design too. You work fast and hard, enough to do the work of dozens of skilled men working constantly over weeks of time in just a single night. You could construct a fully outfitted underground base beneath a house, excavating and manufacturing and coding all the gadgets and rooms and devices needed, within a single night and not leave anyone above ground aware of it."
25,,400CP,Industrialization ,GURPS Technomancer,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Ah, mass production. Where would the world be without it? Nowhere special! Fortunately, you can spread this art with ease, even to things that most wouldn't expect it'd apply to! By gathering a few people capable of producing something, you can form them into a proper production line, no matter how special that item might normally be! What ONE ring? These amazing rings of invisibility are now being mass produced! Get yours now!"
26,,400CP,Man and Machine ,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"The line between the two can be blurry in this world, but an engineer of your skills can make it vanish. You're a whiz with cybernetics of all kinds, able to design, build, repair, and even implant them with expert skill. Beyond just making the body embrace these additions as if they were natural if new parts of the whole your expertise allows you to work with and design implants and devices capable of all kinds of things. From in-built cloaking systems, dermal armor able to deflect and ignore military grade arms fire, dash systems, defensive fields, weapons, and much more. You could turn anybody from just another person into a walking example of posthumanity if you had the resources. Your talent in this field ensures you'll be able to adapt any of your technology into some form of useful cybernetic. Who knows where you'll take the field as time goes on."
27,,400CP,Mark Whatever ,Satisfactorio-Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You want to make a Mark 7 belt? Sure thing. You can create improved versions of your technology just by adding rarer and/or more processed materials to the recipe. These will not be as materially efficient as more of the lower-mark technology, but will be more efficient in other ways, including space or energy-per-effect."
28,,400CP,Mecha-Shift Prodigy ,In The Kingdoms Service,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Students at the Combat Schools learn how to craft and maintain their own Mecha-Shift weapon, and yours was no different. Indeed, you proved to be a veritable prodigy at this, capable of turning metal and parts into some of the most complex handheld weaponry in the setting, so long as you have the tools. With additional training and experience, your skill can even branch out to non-weaponry uses of Mecha-Shift technology."
29,,400CP,Mechanic ,Smash Up,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You can fix anything. Quite literally. Alien technology, magical artifacts. You may not even understand what they do or how they work, but you can see when they're broken and how to fix it."
30,,400CP,Retrofit+ ,Azur Lane,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"Let's face it, some Ship-girls are a little out of date when it comes to the tech department. That's what your standard retrofit is for, getting that old girl caught up with her peers. But, of course, this is a Perk, and nothing standard about it. By buying this Perk, you effectively un-cap all of your Ship-girls in terms of abilities. And you can keep retrofitting them, over and over, ad infinitum. Of course, it gets more expensive and the materials get more esoteric each time, but, it's a labor of love, right? As a bonus, along with the boosts to power, you might find that your Ship-girl starts to radically shift in physical appearance towards your tastes. Maybe that loli Destroyer will grow up, if you want her to. Or maybe you'll find Tennessee becoming softer and more cuddly as the successive Retrofits pile up. As long as you want it, it'll happen. Post-Jump you can do this to anyone, not just your Ship-girls, but you will still need reagents that fit with your target."
31,,400CP,Seamless Construction ,Endless Space,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You might not be able to design the perfect ship, but you certainly could build one that is good enough. Given enough resources and the proper blueprints, you can build ships that would rival that of the Endless, cast as a single, cohesive whole. Even if you build it with mundane methods, it still ends up being nearly perfect, not a single design flaw or construction error in sight. This also applies to things you build that aren't spaceships."
32,,400CP,Super-Max,Generic City of Adventure,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"There's not a single revolving door or scrap of cardboard in the defences you construct. Prisons, team headquarters, space outposts...wherever they are, whatever they're for, you can seamlessly integrate magical or super-tech materials into architecture without compromising function, style or habitability. Marble flooring pressure plates? Electronics mixed with clockwork backups to stymie technopaths? Getting the right mix of anti-demon salt mixed with cement to both look good and still keep them out? Easy. Of course, this perk includes enough architectural skill and artistic flair to make your own jumper-buildings look good, even with a giant glowing insignia on one side."
33,,400CP,Traps and Gizmos ,Kingdom Hearts,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"What do an ice cream machine, a present wrapping contraption, and a pair of gloves have in common? They're all powerful weapons! That is to say, with a bit of elbow grease and this perk you can make them into weapons. Not only can you weaponize rather unusual things, you also excel at creating traps and robots to ensure riff-raff leave you, your store, and your customers alone. You could make electrically charged gauntlets, toy dispensers that can take out Heartless, and candy makers that launch their delicious payload with enough force to knock grown men around."
34,,400CP,You Became A Star ,Robot Unicorn Attack Gauntlet,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You've gained insight into the process of using rainbows to harness Unicornium without having it explode in your face. With it, you can build your own robot unicorns or other rainbow creatures. Once your initial adventure here concludes successfully you will be taught by an expert wishsmith on everything you might need to know to construct Wishes and design your own upgrades for them."
35,,600CP,Centurio Ordinatus ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You have been inducted into the Divisio Militarus, a branch of the adeptus mechanicus dedicated to the construction and operation of the Ordinatus war machines, mighty titan-scale siege weapons of unparalleled power. While the shielding and mobility systems that carry these devices into battle are relatively simple to create, you understand the intricacies of how physics and performance are affected by up-sizing technology. With sufficient data on the function of a humble lasgun or arc rifle to extrapolate from, you could smoothly transition that device to function when a hundred or more times larger - and to be appropriately more powerful than the simple multiplication of its output would suggest. The weapons you create and oversee are fit for a god-machine to wield, and the likes of Nova Cannons and weapons arrays on board the largest ships of the Mechanicus are also within your purview."
36,,600CP,Gadgeteer ,DC Arrowverse,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"The world is a dangerous place, with supervillains and rogue metahumans. This is why you have science to help things out. You're able to make stuff that runs on comic book science. Be it shrinking technology, or a cold gun that fires just a few degrees above Absolute Zero. As long as you have the resources available and a working concept in your head the sky's the limit. Doesn't mean you'll get it right the first time around."
37,,600CP,Gadgeteer ,GURPS Monster Hunters,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"The supernatural? Unscientific? HAH! Monsters and magic are some of the most scientific things out there! Why, with just a bit of effort and some analysis, you can easily tinker up interesting new things from the corpse of a monster, or a countermeasure to a spell, or a device that negates psychic powers! A cord might prevent ghosts from crossing, a flashlight might have a portable fusion reactor to burn vampires, and your gun might auto-plate it's bullets with silver, and you're the one who makes and maintains it all!"
38,,600CP,Lightning is my Art ,Van Helsing,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You have twisted Tesla's theorems, plans, and experiments to whole new levels, creating tools and gadgetry capable of warping lightning and electricity to ends unseen by the man himself. You can give life to stitched-together golems and clockwork automatons with your tools, use electricity to manipulate, warp, or fracture objects to your individual needs, and even twist people into your warped, hunchbacked goons with your favorite flavor of electroshock therapy. Any technology made by you can run off of any electrical source you have access to (and is, in-fact, empowered for it), and has a Gothic London theme to it on a completely unrelated note."
39,,600CP,Perversions of the Natural Order ,The Glass Scientists,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"The laws of physics get very flexible when you're doing engineering. Usually in ways that benefit you. Conductors conduct slightly better, resistors are a little more resistant. As your projects grow in scale, so does this effect. You may even build mecha that ignore square-cube law. With enough time and resources, who knows? Reality can be whatever you want."
40,,600CP,Praesi Engineering ,A Practical Guide to Evil,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"If there is one thing that every Praesi Emperor has in common, it's the ability to take insane and ridiculous ideas and turn them into reality. Flying cathedrals that rain death upon their foes? Sentient tigers? Man eating tapirs? Giant cliffs to throw the hero down? WHY THE HELL NOT! You are capable of taking even the stupid and most insane engineering designs and throwing large amounts of magic at them until they work. Sure, this might require sacrificing a few towns worth of peasants, but that's the sort of thing that peasants are for."
41,,600CP,The Laws are Mine ,Van Helsing,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"The laws of such trivial things as physics, biology, chemistry, really any sort of recognized science are mere guidelines to you. You can break an established rule of scientific nature so long as it supports your goals and abilities. Anything from conservation of energy, to the conservation of matter, to the second law of thermodynamics in that entropy increases over time. Just... still... try not dividing by zero. I can't trust what will happen."
42,,800CP,Tinker Plus ,Generic Worm Fanfiction,Domain: Crafting: Technological,"You're not just a Tinker anymore, you're the Tinker. The PRT rating scale isn't really set up to handle someone like you because it assumes that Tinkers will have specialties, and you don't. You are something never seen before; a genuine omni-Tinker, and one of truly amazing capacity.
Your aptitude and intuition for all sorts of research, science, engineering, and design is absolutely unbelievable. If a project is even halfway related to any of the hard sciences then you can get it done, and do so with a speed and efficiency that makes even experienced Tinkers working within their own specialities look like clumsy beginners. And you can rapidly reverse-engineer other technology given sufficient opportunity to study it, however complex or esoteric it might be. You can even study and analyze exotic and anomalous phenomena, such as cape powers in action, to hopefully gain inspiration for new Tinkertech.
You have a volume knob in your head for making your designs either easily reproducible by mundane methods or totally blackboxed vs. any reverse-engineering or anything in between. You can perform what would have required clean room levels of precision assembly for mundane engineers with ordinary tools and under rough conditions. Troubleshooting or repairing tech that you already understand is a job you could practically do in your sleep, and anything you build or overhaul is maintenance-optional. With time and practice your Tinker abilities can improve and grow indefinitely, without any upper limit.
You can't do things like 'perfected social sciences' or 'auto-win personal interaction methodologies', though. That sort of thing is for Thinkers, not Tinkers."
