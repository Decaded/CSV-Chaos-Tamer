1,,50CP,Electronics ,Star Wars - KOTOR,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"A large supply of computer spikes and repair parts that can be used with nearly any modern machine in the galaxy. Computer spikes overwhelm electronics with junk data and are used by hackers to aid them in bypassing electronic security doors and terminals. Repair parts are packages of universally adaptable components that can be used to fix or upgrade droids, vehicles, and other machines."
2,,50CP,Priority Arrangements ,DOOM 3 V1.0,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"A certain amount of discreetness is required when working with materials as sensitive as those common in your line of work. While high-end tech components or raw materials are easily acquired and delivered, materials such as holy relics or certified virgin's blood are rather less so. Although taking such items through customs and security is normally a fairly sizable challenge, you do have an advantage - these forms. Suitable for ordering items or attaching to crates or other 'deliverables', these certificates ensure that nothing but the most determined intent will ever cause them to be searched during routine checks. You'll not need to worry about delays or unpleasant questions, though you might want to avoid using them to, for example, mail explosives to the UAC's board of directors. Even authoritative paperwork filled out in triplicate only holds so much power, after all. In future jumps, these forms will automatically adjust to whatever other packages you need to get to their destination without any poking and prodding."
3,,50CP,The Gourmet Case ,Toriko,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Keeps ingredients warm or cold naturally. It is a vacuum package container that can contain the data from 10,000 kinds of different ingredients. If the selected ingredient is not in its memory, it has to be manually set up based on its environment that it was found in. One can expand the memory with a memory card. The price for the Takeout 1000 with a memory for 1000 Ingredients is Â¥90,000 yen. (Memory card sold separately. Just joking. You get memory cards for each ingredient found in the Human World.)"
4,,100CP,Honkai Cubes ,Honkai Impact Third,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"You have a supply of Honkai Cubes and know how to make more. Crystallized Honkai energy that when used to make or enhance weapons, gear, or anything really far enhances it beyond normal limits of human capabilities. Of course just having them does nothing, and if you just slap it on a low quality weapon it wont go very far. But with proper application of skill and infusion you can use these to create incredible things. Just beware potential feedback. Not intended to be fed to Tunas."
5,,100CP,Inexhaustible QE Comm Link ,Eclipse Phase,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Two fingernail-sized Quantum Entanglement communication arrays. If each is installed in a separate device, those two devices can communicate instantaneously no matter the distance. Unlike standard QE comms in the setting, the qubits are not expended when information is transmitted. It has the bandwidth of a high-speed fibre optic connection."
6,,100CP,Material Limitations ,World Seed,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Even with the advanced technology commonplace on Earth nowadays, material limitations haven't changed. Or rather, you could say that they've gotten even worse. After all, how are you going to store antimatter if you have only steel at hand? Luckily, you won't ever have problems finding the materials you need. Whether you'll stumble upon them while searching through a scrapyard, or find just the right people who can get you that obscure alloy you need, nothing will stop you from building whatever you want besides your own skill. Well, if you're keeping it reasonable, at least.
The chance of you finding what you're searching for decreases exponentially with the material's strength and rarity, and increases by how much you know about said material, scientifically, and how good your technology skills are. So while a regular schmuck would probably never find Adamantium, someone who could reproduce it themselves in only a few years would have much, much better chances. So if you're in a situation where it is impossible to get what you want with what you know and where you are right now? Then you'll have to get to work yourself. Good riddance then that you can eventually reproduce any material or alloy that you have seen, though for extremely advanced ones it might take an unreasonable amount of time and skill."
7,,100CP,Memory Crystal ,Five Star Stories,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"A backup memory crystal, strong enough that it could easily be used to instantly record live combat information to be replayed later. It could also be used for other mundane purposes, such as serving as the hard drive for multiple supercomputers."
8,,100CP,Nanomaterials Body ,Arpeggio of Blue Steel,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"First free Mental Model, no discount Mental Models use nanomaterials to form a physical body around their Union Core to match their subconscious appearance. All Mental Models have a nanomaterials body surrounding their Union Core for free. You can purchase spare nanomaterials bodies to house any other AIs you might have. For Nanomaterials properties, see the Notes section."
9,,100CP,Provider chest ,Factorio,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Whenever you open this space-bending chest, you'll find an assortment of the standard Factorio resources, ready for processing. A variety of mundane wood and stone, pressed coal, iron and copper ingots, uranium slugs in heavy lead containers, and barrels of oil and water. The chest stores about a cubic meter of each material, and withdrawn resources replenish at different rates - you and your companions will easily have enough water to live off of, a good-sized house could be built with a few day's worth of stone and wood, while metals, particularly uranium, are replaced much more slowly."
10,,100CP,Nanomaterials Sieve ,Arpeggio of Blue Steel,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"This sand sieve can be used to filter nanomaterials from seawater and sand. Even in settings where the seawater doesn't have any nanomaterial particles from damaged Fog ships, it somehow produces about a pound of nanomaterials each time its scooped through the ocean and sand."
11,,100CP,Some Really Good String ,Claymore,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"You have a sizable supply of some really good string, if you were to cut someone's torso open and then reattach their torso with this string, somehow their core muscles would still function regardless of if the wound heals. They would also be able to perform incredible acrobatic feats as though there was nothing wrong regardless of how extreme their movements. As well even if they had their guts ripped open by a monster thrusting their arm all the way through the string itself would remain undamaged, and not even require any attention. Skill at stitching flesh back together not required, or even mildly important, just shove it through and so long as it holds the wound together they'll be good to go."
12,,100CP,Nullspace Computer ,Megas XLR,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"You have a computer tower you can summon from and banish to nullspace. allowing you to upgrade it but otherwise keep it safe. You may summon a holographic interface for it at will.

Wrong handling will be dangerous, however post-Jump, this will be perfectly safe to use in any way. A common mineral in Terra, this semi-transparent black crystal contains enormous energy, and is the primary factor of causing Catastrophes. Widely used in the field of Arts, it works as the basic material and catalyst of all kinds of Arts and Arts items. Without Originium, the efficiency of Arts would, without a doubt, drop dramatically. As technologies develop, more and more countries start to use it as an energy source."
14,,100CP,Thanatonium Supply ,Arpeggio of Blue Steel,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"A material used in corrosive torpedos and other Fog weaponry, this highly unstable matter is used along with nanomaterials to create some of the exotic effects that the Fog's technology is known for, such as graviton engines, and the various gravity and space-altering superweapons. This is a small stockpile, enough to fully re-arm a Fog vessel with corrosive torpedos. The stockpile replenishes monthly in your warehouse."
15,,150CP,Common Material Cache | Rare Material Cache | Lightsaber Crystals ,Star Wars The Old Republic,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Common Material Cache x2 (50CP) This cache contains common 'mundane' crafting materials, such as durasteel, synthweave, armorplast, and tibana gas.

Includes blueprints for turning your materials into these common materials, plus blueprints for all other items you purchase with CP. The material is replaced yearly.
Rare Material Cache (50CP) It's unlikely to be useful anywhere else, but just in case, this cache contains 10 kilograms each of several Lightsaber-resistant materials: beskar, phrik, ultrachrome, and refined cortosis. The metals are ready for use in crafting or modifying equipment. The cache also includes a modest quantity of other exotic materials, such as precious gemstones, technologically useful non-Force-imbued crystals, and organic materials like krayt dragon hide. The material is replaced yearly.
Lightsaber Crystals (50CP) If you want to create more Lightsabers without access to the setting's unique metaphysical geology, you'll need these. Each fist-sized rock has a sample of Force-sensitive crystal growing from its surface, which can easily be broken off into chunks sized for lightsaber crafting or creating Force Focuses. Purchase includes a rock for every type and color of crystal available in the setting, including synthetic crystals such as the red Force-crystals favored by the Sith. The crystals are always properly attuned to whoever harvests them, regardless of color, and will regrow within a day."
16,,200CP,Decals ,Modded Fallout,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"From hot rod flame prints to the ominous black coatings of the Enclave's Hellfire troops and Pew-Pew's Sunset Sarsaparilla look to your dog's pirate bandana, looking the part is all part of the game. This collection of paint sprays, decorative doodads, engravers and other miscellaneous tools gives you everything you need to make quick and easy yet nonetheless remarkably useful cosmetic changes to your equipment.
But more than that - these supplies seem to always make your items just that little bit more more. After all, a custom-made handcannon should be preferable over some standard factory-made model, right? Each modification you make to your items will provide a minor but beneficial effect, such as a lime-green paint job making you more resistant against radiation than you normally would be, and the classic 'red cross' associated with army medics might likewise bolster your first aid and surgical skills. The effects tend to be fairly modest at best, but these supplies are compatible with just about any kind of item you'dlike to use - even those from worlds wholly unlike Fallout."
17,,200CP,Ecto-Ranium ,Danny Phantom 1.5,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Ecto-ranium, the rare and mythical ore that is basically the kryptonite to ghosts. They can not touch it and start to lose their powers when near it. It can be turned into weapons or items. You get a ten pound supply that regenerates monthly. In future jumps this ore will work on incorporeal spirits as if they were solid beings. So you can line your house to keep ghosts out."
18,,200CP,GT Robo ,Toriko,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"The Gourmet Telexistence Robot is a type of robot intended to be used to investigate areas that are normally inaccessible to normal humans. It can supply gourmet ingredients without the user having to step into dangerous soil. The operator can control the movements of the robot from far away and the robot transmits back the senses of sight, touch, hearing, smell and sometimes taste. It can perform the exact same movements in real time. The level of measurement error of the newest GT Robo used by the Bishokukai is less than a millisecond, though individuals with incredible speed like Starjun say that it is still too slow. You can choose from several models of the GT Robo design. The New Model is the first kind of GT Robo seen and also the one mainly used by the Bishokukai. The other kinds of robots seen also seem to be based on this one; the most difficult to control are the Giant type and Micro type. The original models of GT Robos are not used by the Bishokukai and are designed with a more humanoid appearance, with some resembling humanoid robots while others are perfect replicas of the humans they are used by. Original models are used mainly by civilians, wealthy individuals and the Allied Forces. 
The New Model's body is made of a titanium alloy with carbon fiber. The joints are made of Super High Polymer Special Polyethylene with reinforced aramid fiber body hair covering it. The movements of the robot are relayed by its Core Antenna, made of gold for optimal conductivity."
19,,200CP,Jabberwock Claw ,Project Arms,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"This remnant of one of the past rampages of the Jabberwock is a uniquely dangerous item, especially to ARMs. One of the few weapons that can equalise a fight between an ARMs and a non- ARMs, this weapon, which can take the appearance of a literal, almost triangular claw or a sword hilt capable of making a blade of glowing nanomachines at your discretion, retains the Jabberwocks healing retarding function, the Anti-ARMs virus that can leave permanent injuries on an ARMs, those normally immortal and perfectly healing superhumans. Like any sword, its lethality depends on how well it's wielded, but it is the swords property that will make sure any wounds caused will refuse to heal properly. This quality will expand to prevent proper healing in anything with abnormal healing and can deal lethal damage to being normally immortal due to fast-healing or outright regeneration."
20,,200CP,Mods & Augments ,Mass Effect Andromeda,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Sometimes you just need to coax a bit more performance out of your tools. And sometimes, you just need them to do something else entirely. You now have both a full collection of weapon mods and augmentations, as well as the blueprints to produce more. The mods are usable on any weapon of the matching category, even in future settings. And the augmentations are fantastic when you want to change how a gun performs. Maybe you want an assault rifle that can never run out of ammo, or a shotgun that spits lightning bolts? Or maybe you simply want to change the firing options you have available? If you can break down and build a piece of gear, you can integrate an augmentation into it. And the better skilled you are at building that item, the more augments you can put into it. Keep in mind that some augments have different effects if they are on a weapon versus a piece of armor."
21,,200CP,Nth Metal Ingots ,Injustice,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Now this is valuable indeed some of the most valuable material on earth, in fact. This set of ingots, when cast into a proper form and utilized in machinery, can negate gravity, allowing for its user to fly if worn as a belt. Furthermore, it possesses extreme strength and power, making it highly suitable for use in weaponry or armor.

It replenishes the contents each day at midnight. Making it a stable, if small, source of income. You can put another kilogram of any ore, metal or the likes in there so the chest will also produce it in the future. This could be handy if you ever want an exotic weapon."
23,,200CP,Screaming Rock ,Project Arms,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"This unnerving rock, strangely and seemingly naturally sculpted to depict numerous hands and faces of the souls who originally found it, is an alien space rock. No, I'm not joking. Whatever native intelligence it has is either in deep sleep, is silently observing content to remaining passive or has long since vacated the substrate of the rock to somewhere else somehow. Either way you are now left you a hunk of nanomachines that are ridiculously versatile in how they be used. With research you can use this to make your own ARMs, and through using cultured samples you can effective have no real limit as to how many you make, but more easily you can use electrodes to connect more conventional computers to thismass as an interface and use it as a super-advanced supercomputer that requires some jury-rigging into making it useful and will probably require a dedicated custom OS (Operating System). It can't be that hard, heck a 12-year-old managed it."
24,,200CP,Spare Parts ,Generic Factory,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"You will get a large crate marked Spares that will spawn replacement parts whenever something you own or are responsible for maintaining needs replacement parts. The spares will always be of the same quality as the originals. If the crate is destroyed or stolen, it will re-appear whole in your cosmic warehouse the next day."

Filled with an assortment of random bits and doodads that would be considered rare crafting materials for your Aesthetic as well as dozens of other things that could be used to craft Wonders of other Aesthetics, in general it has a massive amount of parts that range from small computer chips to diesel truck engine parts. If you need more just close the box and open it again, it'll be full."
27,,200CP,The Midas Touch ,Highschool DxD,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"You know what plebeians or Neophytes have to struggle for? Money. You know what gets mortals to move mountains and makes your summer trip for you and your friends amazing? Money. You know things you have trouble with? Money isn't one of those things. While you may be rolling in dosh already from your family's holdings or your own hard-earned cash, you are an amazingly competent businessman (or woman) who can quickly turn a dime into 10k with some time and investment, able to quickly secure a large amount of legal income for yourself with little effort. Of course, illegal activities or certain supernatural powers can make those dividends increase tenfold or more...just try not to get caught."
28,,200CP,Treasury ,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Oh, what's this? It seems you grabbed all the money in the treasury before you left!

Anyway, you have at your disposal a huge amount of money, easily equal to a significant percentage of the total amount the most powerful nation here had in their treasury!

You can pay off entire armies hunting for you if you want, or buy islands or even small countries with this. It's ridiculous. In future jumps this treasury adapts, becoming whatever currency is used there, or multiple currencies if that's what you want. Whatever happens, this is always enough to place you solidly among the very absolute richest people in the world.
All this money is always entirely untraceable, allowing you to withdraw it in any number of ways. In worlds that allow it it gives you a secret bank account, or accounts as the case may be, that you can move money in and out of at will, whether by cheques and cards that are also provided, or just piles or cash or precious metals just appearing and/or disappearing in front of you or in your pocket. Any money in here can be withdrawn 1:1 in any currency you want, however exotic. This amount of money is generated anew at the beginning of each jump, or at the end of every decade in jumps that last longer 
than 10 years."
29,,300CP,Olaminium Stock ,Trinity:Aeon,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"A stable isotope of element 114, this recently created material has replaced depleted uranium as the military's ultra-dense material of choice. Being still light enough that it can be used for construction or armor plating, Olaminium is even better than lead at blocking radiation. The sheer demand for this material makes it extremely expensive to acquire, even for the Aeon Trinity, and it is the preferred material for cutting-edge military-grade equipment. You receive about a shoebox's worth of ingots, which replenishes monthly, and the instructions on how to make more."
30,,300CP,Originite Prime Bundle | A2 Arts Drones ,Arknights,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"-Originite Prime Bundle (100CP) You gain access to several crates of pure Originium that can be utilized for various means, and will restock itself every week. Wrong handling will be dangerous, however post-Jump, this will be perfectly safe to use in any way.

* A common mineral in Terra, this semi-transparent black crystal contains enormous energy, and is the primary factor of causing Catastrophes. Widely used in the field of Arts, it works as the basic material and catalyst of all kinds of Arts and Arts items. Without Originium, the efficiency of Arts would, without a doubt, drop dramatically. As technologies develop, more and more countries start to use it as an energy source."
31,,300CP,Programmable Metal ,Batman the Animated Series,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"A special metal that can be programmed with only a few slight touches, creating impressive geometric shapes, weapons, or nigh-unbreakable bindings and changing flexibility and rigidity in a moment's notice. In addition to a small supply of the metal that you have, you also have the know how to make more."

33,,300CP,Vat of F.E.V. ,Fallout 4,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"A vat of Forced Evolutionary Virus, developed by the Pre-War government in their attempts to create super-soldiers. This vat seems to have belonged to the Institute. Those who are dipped inside transform rapidly, gaining muscle mass at the cost of losing their secondary sexual characteristics. That is, if they're lucky; those who have been exposed to radiation tend to have things go wrong, losing their mind as theytransform or worse. Maybe you could find a way to improve on the formula?"
34,,400CP,Done Dirt Cheap ,Pokemon Sword and Shield,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"What's a researcher to do? Good assistants and proper materials are so hard to come by these days. Well, no, not really, you might just be lazy. You can probably find them off the side of the road if you spent about five minutes. This perk helps you get quick volunteers to help look for things your research depends on; and with getting the basic materials and tools needed to do it in the first place, all on the cheap! You could pay off your helpers with stories, or even the results of your research if you don't care to hang onto it. Also helps with getting help with various other situations with similar benefits."
35,,400CP,Echoes of the Time War ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Where did you get these? Or when did you get them? This is a trio of Time Beast eggs. They are a substantial power source for time machines, able to charge them up with enough power to go as far as the creation of the universe, someplace most time travelers couldn't hope to reach on their own. Should you instead decide to hatch them, the Time Beasts that emerge will be loyal to you and see you as their parent, being a ferocious pack that can travel up and down the timestream freely. Let's see how smug your enemies are when you send these angry dogs after them years in the past!"
36,,400CP,Pale Ore ,Hollow Knight Voidheart,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"A highly sought after material, filled with pale energy. Pale Ore was often used in the creation of mastercrafted armor and weaponry, for the edges it can produce are ever keen and never require sharpening or maintenance, and their durability is said to outstrip that of many rare alloy metals. In addition, their cold bite can often quickly inflict frostbite on unprotected foes. You've managed to arrange shipments of this ore, granting you several chunks of it every week, more than enough to make a handful of weapons of a suit of armor."
37,,400CP,Saturn Spray ,Modded Fallout,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Based on the futuristic space-program alloy 'Saturnite', this spray can contains a liquid compound that rapidly hardens into a transparent, protective yet flexible film that bonds onto whatever item it is used on. As in, it turns the item it's used on effectively invulnerable to any damaging or corroding influence, from bullets to plasma and even radiation and rusting. You could spray a Light Machine Gun, and the barrel and firing chamber would never warp or distort from overheating, for example, nor would the paint job flake off or burn up despite the fact the barrel glows red-hot from continued use. Whatever it's used on simply will not degrade or wear out so long as the spray remains in place. Its flexibility means it doesn't actually provide any increase in protection (you'll still suffer internal trauma even if your armor bounces back right after, for example), but you'll never have to worry about your equipment no longer looking the way it should - or working at less than its original effectiveness, for that matter. Should you want to make some modifications (like changing the paint job to something different), you'll also receive a spray can with the releasing agent, which will cause the Saturn Spray to harmlessly peel off and degrade into everyday chemical waste. Both cans are effectively 'bottomless' and will never run out."
38,,400CP,The Straw Millionaire ,Warlock of The Magus World,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"The world operates on the law of Equivalent Exchange, none will work for free. So if one were to want something, they must first offer something equal to the value of the thing they want, be it company, titles, the aid of others or magical ingredients and items. But you seem to just get a little bit more than normal. With 1 gold, you can always exchange it for something that is greater than the amount it worth, maybe just 1 gold and 50 copper or maybe even more. This effect comes after any discount, bargain, taxes, etc... never will your exchange leave you with less or equal assets value than the amount you start with. Walking through a market with nothing but a rock and you'll still come out of it a millionaire."
39,,500CP,NZT-48 ,Limitless,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"You have some pills of NZT-48. This amazing pill lets you easily master many abilities related to the brain, including perfect recall, increased learning speed (fast enough to master the piano in three days), peak human charisma, peak human dexterity and reflexes, hypercompetence, superhuman instincts, peak human sensory absorption, instant analysis, and nigh-unshakable confidence. Unfortunately, the things you learn while using NZT are typically not fully available to you once it wears off.
For free, you receive a replenishing supply, and the formula for, a version that has a few minor, minor side effects during withdrawal or even with continued usage: memory loss, extreme paranoia, blurred vision, hearing difficulties, psychosis, missing time, skin lesions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Limp Dick Syndrome. So yeah, there is a trade-off for genius in a pill.
For 200 CP (included in above cost), you can get a replenishing supply of, and the formula for, an injectable substance based on a cyclical enzyme system, partially developed by Piper Baird, that temporarily makes one immune to the side effects in case you want to control the distribution of NZT. You also have access to a version that grants permanent immunity. If you do not purchase this option, the in-jump version of this cyclical enzyme system will not work in future jumps. The enzymes are free if you have the capstone booster and Master Chemist.
For 300 CP (included in above cost), you have a replenishing supply of, and the formula for, a version of NZT-48 that has no side effects. If you do not purchase this option, you will be unable to upgrade the base version to remove the side effects. This version is free for those who purchase the capstone booster.
For each of these formulas, you may choose to have them work for others or not in future worlds, enabling mass production. However, if they work, others will be able to reverse engineer them so pick your poison. If you choose for them not to work for others, you'll have to oversee the production personally, but the compounds will be immune to analysis."
40,,500CP,Orgel of Origins ,Ar Tonelico,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"A copy of the original Song Science device. A handheld music box that plays a very carefully calibrated song. It is made of Parameno and Grathnode - and gets hot pretty quickly. Enjoy your white hole generator - this is what powers the entire tower, including the antigravity generators, weather control, and giant beam cannons. All of it. It's an infinite energy generator, with a very high output. Unless you buy both this and Song Science, replicating it is nearly impossible, with both it is tricky."
41,,600CP,Computronium ,Eclipse Phase,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"One cubic foot of grade-A, pure TITAN-manufactured computronium originally a block of water ice from Iapetus. This is the kind of thing those commie Argonauts would sell their forks into indenture to get one good look at. Whorls of glassy circuitry and fleeting aurora-like flashes of light are trapped within the clear block. Only a high-bandwidth data port betrays its actual purpose. There's more processing power in this one-foot cube than almost any single computer system in the entire solar system (with the possible exception of the rest of the Iapetus matrioshka computer and any other computronium the TITANs have made, of course); it is capable of insanely massive processing feats. It must be kept cool and powered, since it lacks the rest of Iapetus's infrastructure. It would make excellent substrate to run a Seed AI on."
42,,600CP,Element 115 ,Call Of Duty - Zombies,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"A metal container, containing an assortment of various forms of Element 115. This stuff can do all sorts of things, but it's dangerous, so use it wisely. The contents of the container will regenerate once a month.
* Can be used to upgrade any weapon"
43,,600CP,X-1000 Chip ,Small Soldiers,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"Woah, WOAH THERE BUDDY! Calm down, I know what this looks like. Yes this is the microchip originally designed to improve the tracking & tech on the US military's armaments. It was shut down for a variety of reasons, until being purchased and used without knowing full detail by two knucklehead toy designers who were rushing a deadline. Let me explain how the chip works, alright? By itself, it's nothing. Useless. It has no coding or power to it on its own. But when you incorporate it with something like say, a smart missile or a reactionary action figure, the X-1000 serves to enhance the latent programming. How much does it enhance? Well, the Elites and Gorgonites pretty much became sapient in all but legal rights. Please be careful with this. And, as I know you're going to ask this one comes with the blueprints / schemata for manufacturing more of the Chips, whereas the old plans were trashed."
44,,700CP,Advanced Materials Upgrade Kit | Lathe-Wrought Armour Plating Kit,Light of Terra DLC 4 - Lords of the Iron Line,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"-Advanced Materials Upgrade Kit (300CP) Plasteel, adamantium, armourplas, synth-leather and other sophisticated materials are used for all sorts of purposes within the Imperium, and are typically far more resilient than their archaic equivalents. Archaic styles of armour are seldom effective against advanced weapons, and rarely used in any case, but many of those who hail from primitive cultures favour the styles of wargear they are accustomed to. Wrought from plasteel and armourplas instead of bronze, iron and steel, a suit of chain or plate can be a quite effective defence, often the equal of more modern armours.
-Lathe-Wrought Armour Plating Kit (400CP) The astronomical and gravitational alignment of the Lathe worlds creates the conditions for the production of metal alloys of rare and singular properties. Lathe armour plating is strong and light, flexible enough to withstand the most powerful blows, and even resistant to intense heat or the crackling edge of a power weapon. The cost and rarity of such an upgrade is beyond the means of most individuals, with maybe only half a dozen sets of Lathewrought armour upgrade kits constructed in a decade, each created under commission for a specific wearer."

Instinct ",E.V.O. Search for Eden,Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale,"-Crystals (800CP) Well these little buggers are the cause of a lot of the trouble going down on Earth, but their ability to effect evolution is definitely beyond debate. There are several different types of Crystal, and each purchase of this let's you choose one type. You'll start this Jump with your purchased crystals floating a bit right next to you, and you'll get another once a year. In Jump this will mean finding them, while afterwards they'll be added to your warehouse. Note that you can still find these in jump normally, but this will ensure a regular supply.
Blue Crystal: About as simple as it gets, this little bugger acts as a gatherer and battery for evolutionary potential. Eating it will result in gaining a very large chunk of EVO, enough to fuel a series of large changes for you.
Green Crystal: This crystal analyzes the path evolution has taken, and when ingested will allow you at a time of your choosing to change back to a form in your Record of Evolution, a transformation which may last for up to a month. This doesn't have to be used right away, you can eat it and bank the use until a time of your choosing, and at any one time you can store roughly three such uses.
Red Crystal: Probably best described as evolutionary steroids, and the most blatant of the crystals, this one takes in evolutionary data and uses it to create a new and extremely potent evolutionary form. When ingested you can change into this form, a transformation that can last up to one month. While temporary, and despite having no control over what said form will be, this does mean that said form will be added to your Record of Evolution, which can prove very useful in conjunction with the Green Crystals or the Review of Evolution perk.
Yellow Crystal: This crystals gathers and analyzes evolutionary data. Eating it results in a sudden flood of information into your mind that will inform you of all the various useful evolutionary paths you could take, giving an awareness of options you otherwise would have been completely blind to. Alternatively you can let it rest in an environment for a few days and then devour it to gain a sudden influx of data on the local biosphere and living beings.
-Evolutionary Potential (0CP) You now have the ability to gather and store an energy that can only be properly described as evolutionary potential or EVO for short. This will slowly accumulate as you go about the natural process of survival. Impressive acts such as surviving a natural disaster or mortal combat will grant you larger amounts, and eating food will give you some based on the relative value of it. Namely, the higher up on the food chain (meaning it processes larger amounts of biological energy) it is, the more you'll gain per pound. You do technically have a cap on how much you can store relative to your form, but it's large enough that at full capacity you could go through a large number of relatively 
extreme changes before bottoming out. Actually reaching that maximum is another story.
-Mysterious Time Stream Evolves You (0CP) I shouldn't have to explain why the natural process of evolution isn't really going to work for you. Thankfully you get to cheat. By expending EVO you can evolve yourself, with the cost depending on the scale and complexity of the change, along with how much is diverges from the current state of yourself and nature, as adaptation is specifically influenced by its environment. It's easier to become a large reptilian beast when the dinosaurs roam the earth for example. This only requires intent on your part, with nature handling the rest. Note that evolving leaves 
you with a new body in it's prime, meaning you should haven't to worry about old age. Evolving only requires several minutes to let the changes take place. Never more then five, and should you really push yourself you might be able to manage it in two, although it's advisable to take your time with the process as the end results will be much better if done with patience.
-Record of Evolution (0CP) You can effectively review your evolutionary time line, including all forms you've previously had, in a sort of mental catalog. It possesses all the information you have about the form, and you can sort through it effortlessly to find what you want. While it doesn't really have any use beyond this on it's own, further perks might just let you use these stored designs in interesting way.
-Instinct (0CP) For the duration of this jump odds are you're going to be changing forms on a regular basis, and you probably aren't to be exactly familiar with them. From now on regardless of the form you take you have a full and complete set of instincts that let you control and use your form with competency. This ranges all the way from basic body control to knowing that the thing you see right there is something your body would love to eat. At all times you have a complete awareness of your instincts, as clear as a voice in your head would be, instead of them just being subconscious impulses. 
You're also aware of why they are telling you what they do.
* This seems to need the free evo perks to work, maybe we should add and merge them with this item"
