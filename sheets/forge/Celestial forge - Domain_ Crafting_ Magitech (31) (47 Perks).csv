1,,100CP,Crystal Mechanics ,Final Fantasy Type 0,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"The Byakko Crystal's blessing revolves around the synthesis and comprehension of technology using magic. After all, sufficiently advanced technology is no different from magic. You can understand the workings of advanced technology after tinkering around with it a bit. You can also replicate technology you see by using magic, but until you've attempted it countless times, the end product always seems to feel a bit...lesser in comparison to the original."
2,,100CP,Inspiration ,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Ideas crash like thunder through a genius' life every moment of their lives, barely contained, often barely understood. This is Inspiration, the illumination within, the raw stuff of genius. The greater a genius' Inspiration, the more power of creation and destruction she possesses. But there is a cost. As a genius Inspiration increases, she becomes less able to understand mundane concerns. She struggles to hold onto her Obligation, as people seem more like systems to be explored than individuals with their own lives and concerns. As she becomes almost godlike in her perspective, she must focus to concentrate on the mortal world and its concerns. As your Inspiration grows the buring power of Mania grows with it. All Genii start with a free purchase of Inspiration, Lemurians get three purchases free. It cost 100 CP to upgrade Inspiration. Your Inspiration can not exceed 10, free purchases included. In addition to all of this you will suffer from the Jabir for the entirety of the Jump. As a genius grows more powerful, his Inspiration shines out of him to illuminate the world. This can be a curse for those mad scientists who want to look more ""scientist"" than ""mad."" The genius' Mania begins to tamper with perception and procedure, skewing any attempt to engage in normal science or to perform normal experiments. Though the genius himself suffers no penalties, the odd effects from his perception ""cancel out"" when brought into conjunction with the odd effects from his behavior he struggles to communicate his ideas to others. Modern geniuses call this ""technobabble"" in an attempt to soften the horror of the phenomenon, but it's formally known as Jabir, a sudden, paralyzing loss of clarity and coherence when a genius interacts with a regular mortal.
* Can be bought 10 times, 100CP each time."
3,,100CP,Magitek ,Diabolical,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Rather than being based on technology, you may change your theme to being based upon magic, sorcery, or other metaphysical terms such as divine blessing. Rather than lasers your goons might use magic staves, instead of hovertanks you might have supernatural creatures with durability and power to match. At least you don't have to worry about power sources or that pesky physics thing getting in the way. This can also apply a magic-based sci-fi theme, hence the name. You have sufficient expertise in your newly chosen theme that you can create and invent within the confines of it, at the level of a true master. Even if you don't have previous experience in it, this will grant you all you need."
4,,100CP,Tinkerer ,Azeroth,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"You are gifted at mixing technology and magic. You can make a helmet that shrinks the world! Or maybe it just makes you really really big. It's the magic of science! You are also capable of creating the car-sized piloted mechs (Like Mekkatorques), robots, and auto turrets."
5,,200CP,Apparatus ,Mage the Ascension - Panopticon,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"You have a knack for creating and using tools to solve problems. Implants, weapon systems, manufacturing facilities, all sorts of technology; you know how to take the basic principles of the universe and put them to work. Along with an intuitive grasp of how to use any technologies you encounter (though not necessarily how they work), if you understand an ability, you can create an apparatus to replicate that ability using its own physics. If it's not something you yourself can do, you might need some assistance or 'assistance' from someone or something which can, but as long as you have that and understand the base principles, you're good to go."
6,,200CP,Doll Maker of Bucuresti ,Touhou,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Being an undisputable genius in terms of mathematics and science in a realm ruled by magic tends to undermine just how impressive it is. Your ability with technology and engineering is so great that you are able to adapt to handling, repairing, modifying and even reverse-engineering completely foreign devices you have little to no background on. Your connection with both practical technologies along with magic allows for you to eventually unlock the secrets to creating magitech if given enough time to experiment."
7,,200CP,Hardcore Materialist ,Mage the Ascension - Panopticon,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Everything is stuff, or built out of stuff. You can create things that disregard all that nitty-gritty through abstraction layers, but ultimately all those things humanity sees and values ideas, morality, etc. are arrangement of substance. Substance can be analyzed and reconfigured. You may now treat various ephemeral or esoteric things as being essentially physical and material; ghosts, mental abstracts, divine essence, etc. Maybe not tangible with normal means, but material. With some practice, you can manipulate these substances and even alloy them with other materials, use them as computing substrates, or a host of other things."
8,,200CP,Mi-Go ,Smash Up-Obligatory Cthulhu Supplement,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"You are a master of arcane sciences it would never occur to any human to pursue. If that seems frightfully vague, well, look at it as an opportunity to- shall we say?- expand your mind."
9,,200CP,Moderately Peeved SCIENCE!!! ,Mage the Ascension - Panopticon,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"In the halls of the Etherites, scientific theories based off discarded hypotheses, alternate interpretations, and way too much enthusiasm are constantly debated, and tested, and 'proven' free of the constraints of the scientific establishment. And often, these theories seem to each work even when mutually contradictory, often in the same room. You've worked out how to handle such chaotic innovation in a way that is moderately stable. By attaching subsystems working off wildly disparate understandings of the universe, you can nonetheless make them function well together, with a bit of phlebotinum and GENIUS mixed in. This will never be as stable as putting in the same effort to make something based off an actually coherent theoretical basis, but it's close!"
10,,200CP,Setup Wizard ,Harry Potter,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,You have a natural knack of melding technology and magic. You can easily jury-rig technology to work at Hogwarts. Your inventions could do considerable good for the magical world if they weren't all such luddites.
11,,200CP,The Mystic and the Machine ,Marvel Cosmic,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"The argument between mystics and technology is a faulty one. There is no need to choose one as they enhance and complement one another. Like a certain Mad Titan you have unlocked mastery of combining these two pathways to power. You can always find ways to combine any mystical knowledge you have with any scientific or technical knowledge. This differs from Fine line in that it is all about creating magitech. It also allows you to make a technological version of any magic you know, or a magical version of any technology you can build. All power sources between the two become cross compatible as well. Only fools choose one when they can have both."
12,,300CP,Technosorcery ,Gargoyles,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,Combining magic and technology is a no brainer for you. You can handily blend the two to create amazing effects like broadcasting spells over telephone lines or melding creatures together through sorcerous surgery. Very little in the field of technomagic is beyond your reach with this skill.
13,,400CP,Adaptation ,GURPS Technomancer,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"It's surprising how quickly magic takes to being adapted to technology and vice versa. With only a bit of work, you're capable of creating spells and enchantments that are capable of replicating technology, or technological devices capable of replicating spells and enchantments. With a bit of work, you can even marry the two, taking the best of both worlds to create wonders that take advantage of both the usability of technology and the rule-bending power of magic."
14,,400CP,Arcane Interface ,Storm Hawks,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"While many places and inanimate items are magical, magic itself normally requires a living thing to evoke it. Not so with this perk. You gain insight into creating a technological interface for magical items so that people not versed in magic can pick up and use them. Send a golem instructions through a PDA, or activate a portal with a TV remote. For those capable of magic, this Perk also gives insight into designing spells that manipulate technology, such as conjuring complex machines or altering computer data."
15,,400CP,Clarketech ,Generic Space Opera,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Not only are you able to reverse engineer, extrapolate from, and eventually replicate with a device of your own make any technology you encounter, you also are able to do so with any other phenomenon, be it a physical occurrence, magical or even divine in nature, or even just theorised by you to be possible, though in the latter case you naturally will encounter failure if your theories prove false, in addition to research and prototyping taking a prohibitively long time to do."
16,,400CP,Clockwork Kingdom ,Dark Souls 2,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Yeah working with souls and other special materials is great and all but you don't have that. You've got men, iron and a little bit of the old razzle dazzle. You know what? That's enough to fucking build up an entire kingdom and you can show that off. Near mythological abilities as an engineer. With a basic knowledge of sorcery and excessive skill with clockwork machinations you could create automatons that can follow simple commands, traps that reset and resupply themselves and self-maintaining machines. Although the things you make are marvelous in function, the most spectacular aspect of this perk is their sheer endurance. Despite the moving parts and small components, even when exposed to the elements and left unmaintained, unless deliberately broken they seemingly just keep working forever."
17,,400CP,From Trinitite to Powerstones ,GURPS Technomancer,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"The world of Technomancer does not stand still, and science marches forever onward, even when mana gets involved. And perhaps one of the best ways to march onward is to steal liberally from natural phenomena. You can, by examining a natural magical effect for a few days, figure out how to replicate that phenomena with a spell."
18,,400CP,Getting With The Times ,Highschool DxD,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"The whole 'brimstone and fire' thing is great and all, but the sad fact is that humans have changed much over the centuries, and so it falls onto the supernatural world to change with them. You're something of a pioneer, able to combine both technology and magic together seamlessly to create unique inventions of superscience...things like a hatred-powered robot, or blueprints for something based off of the Evil Piece system. With a little time and ingenuity, who knows what you'll put together?"
19,,400CP,Magic For Dummies specialization: MagiTech ,I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"I see that you are interested in the next one of these. In particular, this series is quite stressful, I can either give you one that covers the basics of most magic systems or you can choose something more specialized. The more focused, the better results you will get. Don't worry about affinities either, there are some notes inside of how to work around that."
20,,400CP,Demigod Atelier ,Asura's Wrath,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"You know the secret science of Mantra technology, and can build custom devices that are powered by prayer or emotion. Further, you can enhance or upgrade items from other jumps to use this same power source. If you take Cyborg Hindu Godbody, you may construct Demigod cybernetics for other people. After the jump concludes, you may also build Mantra Reactors. Demigod Atelier allows you to create any mantra powered or integrated device, up to and including the vast fleets of Shinkoku Tratstrium, the heavenly vessels of the divine armies, and even the antiGohma platform Brahmastra. The latter however would require millennia of effort, and was never completed even in the scope of the original setting."
21,,400CP,Magic Marches On ,The Weakness Of Beatrice,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Ground's Nir might lag behind Earth in terms of technology, but not for too long with you at the helm of scientific advance. Perhaps science isn't the best word. You're not any better at making actual computers out of sticks and raw metal but you are brilliant at making magical or fantastical versions of existing technology you know about. Vehicles powered by magic, calculating systems running on willpower, rocket launchers made with magical materials. Long as you know how to make the original technology, you'll be able to create a magical variation of that technology that is every bit as effective."
22,,400CP,Magical Science ,I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"They said it was impossible, but you showed them the error of their ways. Magic and science work on completely different sets of physics, yet, you have managed to merge them into one set, for a myriad of purposes. Be to make artifacts with instant spells imbued into them, physical doors that lead to other worlds or dimensions, or changing the energy output/input from magical items. The possibilities are endless.... As long as you have the necessary materials."
23,,400CP,Mind in the Machine ,Generic Creepypasta,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Folklore is filled with stories of spirits, but it's only in recent years where they seem to haunt more technological homes. You know a few methods of binding spirits to technological devices to create things like haunted video games or video tapes. These spirits, in addition to the abilities you might expect from their kind, will also have a large amount of control over the contents of their home, altering footage or programming to sow terror."
24,,400CP,Mystical Mechanica ,Dragon Ball,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Did you ever wonder how on Earth Bulma Briefs was able to invent a working radar for a mystical set of artifacts left mostly to myth and rumor? Not anymore you don't. You are able to create devices that are able to detect mystical energies and properties. More than that, you know how to reconcile magical devices and technology, able to combine the two should you have the skills and abilities for either."
25,,400CP,"Pankosmoi, the Needle Grail",World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"A pipedream housed inside a house of smoke and mirrors. This is the hidden Axiom. With this the manifestation of a person's Mania could be pushed over the edge and into a real physical law, unique to this power, thus all things that were built by you within this Axiom are now real actualized repeatable phenomena unless you choose not to add in the element of Pankosmoi to the Wonder itself. Now the creation of Wonders is a true reality, a 'hard science' if you will. This also stacks with any other engineering or technological knowledge you have, letting you incorporate Wondrous features, such as the non-repeatable phenomena without Havoc or something to that effect, and update other technologies seamlessly into a greater whole of science. This uniquely affects the capstones of each background (See Notes) as well as provides the following benefited options to all Genius' Wonders: all of the Genius' Wonders are immune to the effects of Havoc, the Genius gains the ability to take an impossible fact of the world and create a Bardo with it, and finally the ability to destroy non-sentient matter to harvest massive amounts of Mania from Reality itself."
26,,400CP,Project: Black Book ,Freddy vs Jason vs Ash,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"With the existence of the supernatural, is it any surprise that science has advanced further as well? In secret labs beneath the capital, scientists work to unravel the secrets of the paranormal- creating machines to translate the Necronomicon, finding ways to open portals to the Deadite's dimension to retrieve Freddy Krueger, even attempting to find a way to replicate Jason Voorhees's unique condition. You have an increased knowledge of science that could make these things possible for you to do. Hopefully, you'll be a little smarter about it than Uncle Sam was."
27,,400CP,Stress Testing ,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"The working of wonders is an act of Inspiration. It is not so fundamentally buried in the ways of science as to ignore other outlets and some folk in the Hermetic Order of 28 Spheres has turned you to their experiments in this area. With this perk you will be able to find and utilize the Clarke Line, this is in reference to Clarke's Law that states that sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from sufficiently advanced technology, to create technology so close to magic as to count as it. The 'science' behind this must still always be consistent internally but it can now benefit from things that would usually only be the prudence of magic, including perks. This means that magic and perks that benefit magic can affect Wonders as if Wonders were magic."
28,,400CP,Technomagical Gal ,Smash Up Big In Japan,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Your magic combines very easily with technology, boosting and enhancing it. You can charm devices to run off mana, work with greater strength, self-repair and generally function better. It's so cool how you can use magic and tech both to do things neither could alone!"
29,,400CP,Technomancy ,World of Darkness - Mage: The Awakening,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Using technology with magic is not a new practice, especially since technology has existed since man first made fire, or tied a stone to a stick and called it a spear. While there are many other mages who purport to merge technology and magic, you do so with such seamless efficiency that it is nearly impossible to tell where technology ends and magic begins. You could tie the triggering of a spell to a computer program, having it take effect when someone tries to open it. Or perhaps you could use your magic to improve the quality of machines, increasing their speed, effectiveness and overall power. Perhaps you could even write out a grimoire, a repository of magical knowledge into a simple graphing calculator. Whatever you do, it will likely be creative and never seen before as the disparate disciplines are masterfully merged under your guidance."
30,,400CP,The Control Variable ,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"The Non-Repeatable Phenomenon, an impossibility that can only happen due to the presence of Mania, has but one rule that must always be followed; the internal continuity of the Phenomenon must always be consistent. Using an understanding of raw physics and the laws of the world as defined by the absence of Mania as the base of all of you experiments was an Inspired choice. You now have the ability to create a Control, a variable that can only change when you personally change, which allows you to change your Aesthetic to 'Real World Technology' but the more powerful effects are that you can use this practice to bind Mania to the idea of a wonder and allow it to be mass produced, though this doesn't allow you to stop Havoc it does make it so you could create functionally identical Wonders without a limit as mass production is a cornerstone of the modern technological world, and that you can, with an explanation of the process to work and maintain the Wonder, allow people to 'count as' Beholden, humans who through no Inspiration of their own slip into the worldview of a Genius and can use Wonders, for the purposes of not causing Havoc. You can switch between your chosen Aesthetic and the one provided by The Control Variable at will.
* Designed to let you mass produce a form of magitech"
31,,500CP,Code Caster,Lt Ouroumov's Worm CYOA V17,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Delving into the realm of mysticism and the cutting edge, you have unlocked the knowledge to translate magical spells into digital code, allowing them to be uploaded and cast through technological devices. By harnessing the device's inherent power, these spells come to life in extraordinary ways. But the true marvel lies in your ability to manipulate and reshape the very fabric of these spells, for they exist as lines of code waiting to be altered.

While you are not bestowed with limitless freedom in modifying these spells, you hold the power to shape their mechanics and rules to your advantage. Imagine a shield spell that automatically activates under specific conditions, creating an impenetrable barrier just when you need it most. Picture transforming an elemental spell, shifting its control from the fiery embrace of flames to a gentle inferno, or even changing it's color to pink."
32,,600CP,A Correlation of Constants Between Physical Reality and Wondrous Artifice Creation ,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"The work of a lifetime transcribed into your mind. The simplistic wish to have something real and valid in one's own hands materialized into a theory, not a Law, which by all rights should not exist as it does. All forms of Mania comes from the unknowable power of Inspiration but if looked at from another angle one can not help but to find themselves gazing backwards, after all even myths and legends usually have a grain of truth to them. Using a method of your own devising you have figured out how to break something down until you find the core idea that made it real in the first place, granting you an astounding ability to understand the working of something through proper physics. You can take any Non-Repeatable Phenomenon and translate it into a Repeatable Phenomena at the cost of exorbitant power and size upgrades. You have also reversed one of the eldest uses of Mania, the ability to power even mundane things as if with electricity, so that you can power your inventions on electricity instead of Mania."
33,,600CP, A Master of the Axioms ,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Axioms are the 'channels' of mania that make the most orderly and understandable Wonders happen. The Axioms are not reliable, by any means, let alone consistent. A genius can imagine them as knots of cohesion floating in a vast illuminated sea of Idea, little islands where things almost make sense, though the shoreline shifts fractally with every passing second. Mastering each of the Axioms in turn allows a Genius to gain control of aspects of his own Wondrous works. A master of Axioms can do things beyond the scope of his fellows and has a true grasp of the deeper weirdness that comes with Mania. You have become a master of these powerful foundations. Most look at you in awe but you still feel there is further to go yet. In addition to this mastery of the Axioms allows you to utilize any other engineering or technological knowledge that you have, allowing you to make those types of devices as Wonders as well, enhancing their traits by doing so. Aside from the ability to create wonders from technology your Inspiration also allows you to see how the various technologies could be used together. Though this insight is small and it will take work to realize."
34,,600CP,At The Precipice of Magic and Science ,The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Fourth Time,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"At the precipice of science and magic there are untold wonders, imaginations made real through their power. Power that may soon be yours. You are a master of both science and magical knowledge, to the extent that the combination of the two is but a small affair, and though you are not yet an equal to the long dead hero Zakkart, with time you will be his match, and perhaps even exceed him. With time, effort, and study, it would not be unusual to see you creating technomagical wonders on par with the atomic bomb, or even greater things still such as the Root of Life, a material capable of healing any injury and even creating entirely new bodies by connecting not to the body, but the soul. This and far more fantastical creations will one day be at your fingertips."
35,,600CP,Atop The World ,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Walk this path carefully. This is the art that both saved, and destroyed Hyrule. You have unlocked knowledge of the greatest force multiplier the Sheikah were ever able to field - Large, walking, warmachines. You have a basic knowledge of the Sheikah's art of automation and robotics, with this alone giving you the knowledge to craft the small Guardians utilized by Shrines in combat tests, with the right materials. However, with enough resources and development time...you could create constructs that could even rival the 4 great Divine Beasts. This is the pure expression of Power...just remember that Power must be tempered with Wisdom, and wielded with Courage. Power without restraint is the domain of Calamity Ganon, after all."
36,,600CP,Cyber Sorcerer ,Digimon World Re: Digitize,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"No one would ever confuse you for a faceless technician; in fact probably quite a few people would be grateful for the chance to meet you. A genius within the fields of programming and electronics capable of not only preventing civilization from being flung back to the dark ages after cataclysmic disaster, but help lead it to the world of tomorrow one innovation at a time. A true peer to the great minds of GIGO, or perhaps even one of the brilliant minds that have assured it's domination of the tech industry world wide. However, such genius goes beyond the bounds of what might be considered 'conventional' science and engineering. While the creation of something akin to the Digitization Phenomenon Program would require years worth of concerted efforts between dozens of genius on your level; the creation of applications such as digivices capable of affecting the world, machines able to detect and interact with other realms, and the creation of self-evolving AIs are well within your grasp. Truly, yours is a mind that could usher in a new golden age for mankind; or its destruction"
37,,600CP,Gear Formation ,Gonna Be a Twin-Tail,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"The secrets of Affinity technology have been unveiled to your eyes and to your mind. You are able to create and even modify the Gears that are powered by Affinities and to use Affinities to power or alter other technology as well. Gears are created by a special process that requires the investment of one or more extremely strong Affinities on a permanent basis, so try not to use one of your own Affinities. You can also use Affinities to grant unique effects or powers to other things that you craft, investing them into the project to grant it an 'enchantment' based on what Affinity was put in, similar to the unique powers that Ultimaguil members often wield. With a bit of work, you can even use any important part of a monster as a substitute for this, sacrificing organs like a heart or brain of some monster to grant a unique ability to something that you are creating."
38,,600CP,Mad ,Make a Wish,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"You are mad, who else would try to mix magic with science, you though have seen the idiocy in the distinction of magic and science, to you they are all but one, knowledge of magic helps science and knowledge of science help magic, though only in related fields, the more specific you are in a field, the narrower the focus of the boost to related fields, for example knowledge of thermodynamics will help in spells and magic related to temperature, ice and fire and vice versa in case of science, but with knowledge of combustion will only help in fire magic and the like. Another benefit of your madness is that any project, whether it be a mega-structure, a vehicle, a weapon or a utility device, when created through a mixture of magic and science will cover the disadvantages and weaknesses and improve the benefits and advantages of similar devices, compared to those created with only science or magic."
39,,600CP,Magitech Master ,World Seed,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"If you looked at Neolife's technology for only a bit, you'd be surprised to see that it is not technology at all. Well, not pure technology at least. Rather, the technological standard in the game is magitech, a fusion of magic and technology. And it looks like you've taken a shine to this kind of thing, evident by your new skillset.
First of all, you are able to build a technological equivalent of any magic or other supernatural ability, like a Psychic power, and vice versa. If you could cast a basic fireball or lightning bolt spell, you could build a gun that can do the same. If it's something more complex than that, for example a whole skillset like fire magic, you might instead be able to build a nanite swarm or a glove that could grant it wholesale to other people, or a robot innately able to do it.
The same goes for any technology you are able to build. If you had a device at your hand that could stabilize space in a radius, preventing any dimensional shenanigans, you'd be able to create a spell that could do the same. And if you studied a space ship, you could create a spell that would let you travel the void unhindered at the same speed and with the same protection.
But of course, you are also able to make actual magitech, using the strengths of both fields to negate their weaknesses and make something surpassing what you could do just using one of them. Whether it is space ships powered by magic and enchanted to be far sturdier and more powerful than their material makeup would suggest, ships powered by white holes that are contained through magic, warp gates allowing for unmolested travel throughout the galaxy once they are set up, or bombs that break open rifts to subspace, capable of easily scorching a planet through mana acting like antimatter rushing out of them, there's no technology to be found in Neolife that is beyond your ability to create."
40,,600CP,Magitech wizard ,Dog Days,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"You are able to easily combine magic and technology, letting you make things like radio antennae and signal boosters that rely on magic. Maybe you could replace ammunition with bolts of magic. With this you can replicate the effects of technology with magic, and it will likely be less complex too. This isn't a one way process however, you may also replicate the effects of magic with technology. This will be much more complex than the alternative however."
41,,600CP,Magitek Mastery ,Final Fantasy VI,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"In essence, magitek is simply the use of magical energies as a power and fuel source for technology. Your understanding of that outstrips anyone else, and you can now apply this principle to any technology you own.
By altering your devices to use something magical in nature, such as a magicite stone, an enchanted item, or just raw magical energy, you can enhance it in every single way and give it unique properties. A suit of armor would become much harder, lighter, and more agile than before, perhaps even boosting the physical abilities of the wearer in line with the magical power source.
From there, the armor could make more esoteric uses of the magic, such as casting spells on its own based around the sort of magic infused into it automatically or at the wearer's prompting. This isn't some measly effect restricted to the mundane or basic, no, magic can infused into any sort of technological device to enhance its functionality and give it a partially magical nature and powers.
Even life may be infused with magitek technology like this, not only as cybernetics but directly as well. In this situation, it behaves a bit differently. The magic integrates itself into their body, becoming a natural part of them, allowing them access to that magic system and enhancing them physically, but they must grow into it. They start at a much weaker level, where they have to practice and develop their connection to this magic to realize it fully.
There's no upper limit to them beyond what the magic's system is capable of, but it can take time, and you can instead choose to infuse living things with a larger amount of magic to grant them greater magical ability much more quickly. Unfortunately, this can have dangerous side effects, as giving them too much to handle at once can lead to mental instability or even insanity, the severity rapidly scaling upwards the more initial energy put in."
42,,600CP,Man Made World ,Fate/Grand Order,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"When Nikola Tesla took the secret of lightning to humanity, he spat in the face of Gods and Magicians alike. He had taken the divine and made it mundane for the sake of humanity and that act gave him genuine, immense power. While some may point to the ridiculousness of his science becoming supernatural, one can't ignore the power that technology gained, especially against the supernatural.
You are a true creator in the same vein as Tesla himself now. The technology you create is supernaturally empowered, becoming more and more so the wider spread your technology is in the world you are in and the more your technology advances that world. If you created and spread around the world the secret of electricity, which revolutionised the entire world, you would then be able to create electrical devices that allowed you to do battle with even some of the mightiest Servants in history. Your technology is also imbued with even greater power than normal when used against Divine opponents, as the Gods seem to have an innate aversion to the progress you bring.."
43,,600CP,Mind of the Sun ,Exalted - The Solars,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Many speak of the First Age and its lost wonders, forgotten and quietly waiting for the return of their masters. However, far too many fixate on what was and what could have been, instead of looking towards the future, and you are not one who has time to waste rummaging around old ruins for secrets. Your Exaltation holds many of the lost knowledge of crafting and forging great Artifacts, as well as lost sciences of the First Age such as biogenesis. You begin with the basic knowledge and fluency in Old Realm, as well as mastery of the various sciences and ways of crafting from the First Age, able to forge weapons, warstriders, and other items of legend to add to your own panoply. As a bonus, you know how to substitute magical materials for such items with their mundane equivalents or metals in other worlds - useful in worlds without materials such as orichalum."
44,,600CP,Science and Sorcery ,Marvel Magic,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Ordinarily magic and science are anathema to one another. Magic is not so simple or subservient that it can be mapped out with laws and hypotheses and will often take offense to attempts to do so, spitefully refusing to cooperate just as you think you're beginning to understand. For you, however, this is an entirely different story. Not only do you find it easy to mimic the effects of technology with magic or vice-versa, but you are talented at melding the two together into something more than the sum of its parts."
45,,600CP,Song Science ,Ar Tonelico,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Before there was Song Magic, in the golden age of the First Era it was discovered that three materials, Parameno, Grathnode and Ardel, allowed for the conversion of sound into magic. From this, came the Tower and all its glories - as well as the eventual destruction of the world. Long forgotten, you have a complete theoretical knowledge of the true underpinnings of Song Magic, Reyvateil biology and the Tower as was understood at the height of the First Era. With sufficient resources, you are capable of creating or altering reyvateil, and repair and alteration to Tower hardware, something it has gone millennia without. With resources comparable to a superpower, you could potentially could raise your own Tower or complete Metafalss.
Song Science allows for the precisely targeted creation of energy fields and semi-permanent matter, such as fireballs, giant swords, force-fields or functional computer systems allowing a Tower to sing itself into existence from a seed. It can apply this to control the weather, manipulate gravity, create life, transmute existing material into new objects, broadcast power with no loss rate within its range, mirror a Halfblood's mind on the SH Server in real-time, convert matter into digital data and vice versa. It cannot create permanent matter, which is mediated by the Wills of the Planet allowing it to become a part of their body."
46,,600CP,Technomancy ,World Seed,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Often hailed as the most innovative magic, users of Technomancy are capable of creating, controlling, scanning, and even assimilating technology with magic. And now you are one of them. But not just a normal one, oh no. Your talent with Technomancy can rightfully be said to be quite monstrous. Whether it is commanding machines to do your bidding with just a thought, probing devices with your magic to discover their functions and any possible flaws, or disassembling and reassembling them, you can do it all with contemptuous ease.
If you trained a bit, you could of course also create your own technology to use, entirely through magic, as long as you have any necessary materials before you. Another interesting ability of Technomancy is its function to let you interface with technology and use yourself as a medium for information to be displayed. So if you, for example, wrote a program to let something pass through your Aura, such as the hologram function of your companion bracelet, you could simply use Technomancy to establish a connection with the bracelet and yourself.
But your biggest talent lies in the replication of implants and other technological marvels within yourself and others. You could for example quite easily copy the aura of a camera and adapt your eye to mirror it, or do the same to the auras of memory banks and computers to enhance your brain. With your skill, you don't even have to worry about overloading your puny biological body by using technology that is too advanced.
Beyond that, what you can do is up to you. After all, the potential of magic is only limited by its users ability, creativity, and skill. Though I'm sure that with your potential, you'll manage to go quite far in the rat race of life. Concerning technology at least, social skills are not included in this package."
47,,1200CP,Technomage | Merlin Returned ,Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Technomage (600CP) There is so much more to magic than what these stuffy inbred old purebloods believe, and you can show them! You are an absolute master of the art of Techno-Magic. Making machines that run on magic, or just magical equivalents of Muggle technology, or something as simple as just making muggle devices work in magical environments is all child's play for you. You can translate flawlessly between technology and magic, meaning that you can make technological equivalents to all magic you know and magical equivalents to all technology you can make without losing so much as an iota of effectiveness.
Merlin Returned Boosted - While being good at merging magic and technology is pretty good, being able to merge wildly futuristic technology with highly advanced magic is better. Not only are you highly skilled at magic, but you're now just as good at the technology side of it, being a certifiable genius among geniuses. Your merged devices now run far superior to either the magic or the tech would run alone, providing dramatically higher effectiveness and utility. In addition, your skills with the more 'technical' branches of magic, such as Arithmancy and such cross all imagined levels. Finally, you can achieve even things normally believed impossible through combining spells and technology. You can dispense with the more symbolic and ritualistic components of any and all magic you do, making it entirely as reproducible as technology.
Merlin Returned (600CP) (Capstone Booster) There were ancient tales of your coming, Jumper. Actually, wait, no. There weren't. But there should have been. You were born to greatness, and this reflects in everything you do. Magic is second nature to you. While you don't get any skill or knowledge innate with this perk, nor any gifts or talents that pass down bloodlines or through rituals, you now have limitless talent in every single branch of magic apart from these limitations. Besides that, you are a genius at learning magic too, mastering years' worth of material in days and weeks without even stressing yourself. This growth continues indefinitely, never slowing no matter what. Your grasp of magic and its theoretical framework is such that you can manipulate the very nature of it, and do so with an almost contemptuous ease. You can take apart spells, rituals or even entire magic systems, and put them back together in whatever different arrangement you like, even in entirely new magic systems of your own. Even altering spells in real time is second nature to you, changing their effects, size, scope, everything. As is coming up with entirely new pieces of magic, with due research and innovation.
Finally, to fuel all this, your 'Magical Core', per se, is proportionately vast. You have a humongous amount of magic at your fingertips, stretching far and beyond any known metrics well into the realm of legends like Merlin and the Founders. This perk follows you in the future too, providing you all of these effects in any and all magic you become able to do. This perk is a capstone booster, meaning that it serves to enhance each of the origin capstones in their own ways. The interactions are mentioned alongside the respective perks."
48,,1400CP,Golem Crafting | Machine Crafting | Stupidly Powerful | 17 ,Dragon-Half,Domain: Crafting: Magitech,"Golem Crafting (400CP) You have studied not only magic and crafting, but how to blend the two, allowing you to create golems using a variety of materials. These golems are powered and animated by the magic you instill in them, requiring a well-crafted form suitable for enchanting. The larger and more powerful the construct, the longer it takes to create. Your constructs are capable of what limited independent thought and action might be necessary to carry out relatively simple orders. This style of creating magical constructs is light on crafting and heavy on magic.
Golem Crafting SP: Your connection to your magical creations is especially strong, which has allowed you to figure out how to summon any of them to your side with a few words and a gesture, no matter where they might be.
Machine Crafting (400CP) Golem crafters make enchanted mobile sculptures. You consider this crude and inefficient. You know that by carefully designing and assembling all the moving parts, you can make things that require far less magic to power them. Not only are your creations more energy efficient, they are also faster, more versatile, able to follow more complex commands... And less durable. The unfortunate downside of building complex machines is that tiny moving parts are easier to break than carved blocks of stone. This style of creating magical constructs is heavy on crafting and light on magic.
Machine Crafting SP: You have figured out space compression enchantments that allow your creations to have more stored within them than they should be able to hold. This allows you to pack them full of tools, weapons, extra cargo space, or mess with their designs in imaginative ways.
Stupidly Powerful (600CP) You are an exceptional example of your origin, both mightier and more impressive than the ordinary. You gain enhanced versions of every perk you buy that is free or discounted for your origin. These enhancements are marked SP in each perk description. Unfortunately this also means that you draw a lot of attention to yourself, and are an interesting topic of conversation. You gain the Light Speed Gossip drawback for +0cp.
17 (0CP) Your maturity grants you insight and focus, allowing you to craft constructs that are far more powerful than before in a fraction of the time that it used to take you to build your old weaker ones."
