1,,Free,Attendants ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Assitants,"Choose: A dozen servoskulls, a five-servitor workforce, or a trio of personalized cherubs. All are dull but 
reliable servants, coming equipped for a variety of tasks. The patterns of each are easy to re-fit for more 
specialized work."
2,,Free,Companion Bracelet,World Seed,Domain: Assitants,"A bracelet housing an evolving AI; although Alliance policy is to hand them out to people only after 
they've gotten their class at level 10, an exception was made for you to get it a bit earlier. Although 
called a bracelet, there are different forms for different races. Slime people might be injected with a 
nanite swarm programmed with the same effect, for example. Once you have equipped the bracelet, the
AI will adapt itself to gain an ideal personality fitting your own. The AI of a loner might become their 
perfect friend, that of a rich girl always left alone might become a butler caring for her, and someone 
living a loveless life might find that their companion AI has all the qualities they'd want in their 
girlfriend.No matter how your companion AI will end up, they will always end up in your best interest. As
they have a photographic memory and see the world through your senses, they can highlight important 
objects or places you might have missed, jog your memory if you forget something important, or browse 
through the internet to find information a million times faster than somebody with a human brain 
would.There are also various upgrades that can add to the functionality of the companion bracelet, such 
as identifying software allowing your companion AI to scan the Aura of creatures or objects to determine
their ability, level, and other information, or even an upgrade to allow an instance of them to live in your 
brain and tap into your senses to control your body in dangerous situations, or just show the trajectories 
enemy projectiles will take so you can easily dodge them. For 50 CP each, you can apply one upgrade to 
your companion bracelet, with no limit on how many you can purchase."
3,,50CP,Stockpiles ,Girl's Frontline,Domain: Assitants,"We can't let you set off empty-handed; here's 5000 Ammo, Parts, Rations, and Manpower to get your 
army started (it takes 30 of each to make a baseline T-Doll, while the most consistently powerful Dolls 
cost something like 600/400/100/600 for a reliable chance of getting them). Each purchase gets you 
another 5k. * This is not just normal ammo, parts, rations and manpower, you can combine them to 
make T dolls which are AI-piloted android fire platforms for military operations."
4,,100CP,A Thinker of Your Own ,Hive Queen Quest,Domain: Assitants,"This adorable little guy is about 2 feet long and has all the autistic number crunching power of a 
supercomputer and a truly limitless attention span, if you set him to a research task he will sit and think 
about it until he finally makes a breakthrough. Whenever they finish a project he will psionically alert 
you ""WE FINISHED RESEARCH FOR QUEEN!"" or ""WE MADE THING FOR QUEEN!"" If you aren't a queen 
that's ok too, don't worry he still loves you and would do anything in his power to help you, which is a 
limited proposition since he is literally just a brain with basically useless legs and little to no motor skills."
5,,100CP,Butler ,Big O,Domain: Assitants,"As soon as you start the jump, an old man offers to be your butler. He is like Norman Burg in all aspects, 
capable of cooking delicious meals, repairing advanced technology, and helping you with day to day life. 
He also comes with an awesome motorcycle with a built in rocket launcher and a rifle strong enough to 
take out spider robots."
6,,100CP,Constructor Drone and AI Kernel ,Warhammer 40k: T'au Empire,Domain: Assitants,"This drone is an automated constructor unit, capable of building simple machines and buildings on its 
own and more complicated structures and technologies under your direct supervision, so long as it has 
materials to work with. Its tools can be easily customized or replaced with new or different technologies.
Moreover, its software includes a kernel that can be used to grow specialized AI and VI systems 
optimized for various computational substrates and tasks that are always loyal to you."
7,,100CP,Digital Ally | Dum-E and U ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,Domain: Assitants,"-Digital Ally (50CP) Ready and waiting! This A.I. is not truly sapient, but it is still capable of performing 
extremely complex tasks like controlling a small army of robots or managing the infrastructure of a 
technologically advanced base... at the same time as overseeing a battlefield and relaying tactical data to
you. You can design its personality and appearance to suit your needs, and even give it a classy accent! If 
you wish, you may import an A.I. or companion into this role.
-Dum-E and U (50CP) Okay these robots may not do much, but they've got spirit! ...whatever passes for 
spirit in robots. Taking the form of single robot arms on treads, they try to do their best to aid you 
around your home and fulfill your wishes. Along with excellent pattern recognition they're unusually 
good at assisting with fabrication and mechanical construction of electronics. Just be mindful that you 
need to word things properly."
8,,100CP,Engine-sister,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Assitants,"Voluminous red robes cannot hide the curves beneath to this woman's eternal embarrassment. Friendly 
and perky in conversation to both man and machine, she is torn between her desire to be closer to the 
machine and her attachment to humanity. The possibility of a harmonious union between the two has 
inspired her to follow you. She has all 100, 200, and 400cp engineer perks. She also has 'subtle bionics' 
'artisan' and one pick of 'magos designation.'"
9,,100CP,Je'Lu Pih'ar' the Pilgrim,Endless Space,Domain: Assitants,"Space... The final frontier. This old man of indeterminate race wants nothing more than to see each and 
every planet, star, and cosmic anomaly in the cosmos. He wants to see the entire life cycle of a star first 
handed, from birth to death, even if he must see a million different stars to see the full cycle. He is a very
spiritual man, and often spends days meditating on the glory of the cosmos
Plus: Deep spirituality helps lift morale
Plus: Extensive knowledge on galactic anomalies
Netural: Spiritual views sometimes cloud his judgement, but can sometimes explain the unexplainable
Minus: Have you heard about our lord and savior, the Endless Space?(Humming Intensifies)"
10,,100CP,Magos miscellaneous ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Assitants,"This man's(?) flesh is hidden beneath extensive augmentation. He has been with the Mechanicus for 
centuries, and his interests are many. Less puritanical than most, the possibility of extending the quest 
for knowledge to dimensions unknown to the Cult appeals to him. He has all of the 100, 200, and 400cp 
magos errant perks, and three picks of Magos Designation."
11,,100CP,R2 Series Astromech Droid ,Star Wars Clone Wars,Domain: Assitants,"A small automated mechanic that can perform a variety of repair duties and serve as an additional

12,,100CP,Soma the Sophon,Endless Space,Domain: Assitants,"Make way, we got a mad scientist on our hands! Soma is an overly curious, hyperactive, far too smart for 
their own good, know-it-all that loves nothing more than to create new devices. Even if she doesn't know
exactly what it will do, she just LOVES to build things and experiment. She's a bit of an oddball for her

mental prowess at any opportunity

Minus: Expect a LOT of lab accidents. Hope you have a good medic onboard.."
13,,200CP,Living Flower,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Assitants,"A lovely young woman who loves to wear flowers in her hair. And totally not a parasitic plant based 
lifeform that ate her brain. What a rude accusation. Anyways, she’s taken a shine to you, and is a master 
of the herbal arts. Aka making potions, poisons, and various other ‘herbal remedies’. For the immorally adventurous, swappable bodies."
14,,200CP,The Toymaker ,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Assitants,"Hey hey, it’s the Virgin Lolicubuss’s older sister! Well, one of them anyways. This one shares her younger 
sisters disdain for men, mostly because she likes women and toys better. As a result, she’s the one who 
made the collar designed to control her sister and with enough time and effort, she can also make these for other people. Or something more normal like her seemingly endless supply of sex toys, regular and ‘custom ordered’."
15,,200CP,Build-A-Minion Kit ,Lego Dimensions,Domain: Assitants,"A nice set of parts for building your very own robotic henchman. They are guaranteed to be absolutely 
loyal to you, with the ability to appear automatically at your side when you call for them. Though they 
are sapient, they won't count as a Companion unless you Import them into another setting. "
16,,200CP,Bond of Brotherhood ,Final Fantasy X,Domain: Assitants,"You may very well be only one of many Guardians defending your Summoner – and frankly, the more 
Guardians there are on the task, the less likely anyone is to fall. There’s safety in numbers after all. 
Travelling with a group of Guardians, it’s only natural that you’ll come to bond with them.
The longer you fight alongside the same companions, the more in sync you will be with those 
companions. Alongside these trusted companions, you’ll find that their abilities seem to boost yours, 
increasing the effects of your abilities by a small bit for each companion nearby."
17,,200CP,Ding! ,Girl Genius SB,Domain: Assitants,"Well, this is different. A certain gentleman called Von Neumann would be delighted, at least. You are 
now the proud master of a full set of Dingbots of your own, or similar clanks or drones, at least. 
They're all minor sparks in their own rights, and can themselves build more of their kind, even though those don't have the spark. Led by a Prime, they are connected with you on an intrinsic, mental level, being fully capable of building any and all devices or works you can. They get everywhere, performing construction upkeep, salvage and everything else you might need them to. Not even needing blueprints, they seem to draw upon your knowledge directly, using their in-built tools to perform all the things you normally would need to do yourself, making everything you'd like them to... and a lot of them you wouldn't. Don't leave them unsupervised."
18,,200CP,Garment Gloves ,Dodgeball,Domain: Assitants,"These are a pair of pure white gloves. Bound to them is an intelligence with a mind for fashion: a designer, seamstress, clothier, and tailor without a mortal peer. It has the ability to scry for fashion based information from international trends to precise measurements. Given materials and orders, it will industriously produce fine apparel, producing any modifications, clothing, footwear, accessories, etc that is within theoretical mortal ability. It has sufficient telekinesis to move itself and to independently suspend materials. It must be provided with materials, though it may be provided a lump sum or budget with which to magically acquire materials at cost. You may wear the gloves to channel the skills (but not powers) of the entity, perhaps even learning from it."
19,,200CP,Huragok Ally ,Halo - UNSC,Domain: Assitants,"Something of a surprise and most definitely an attention-grabber, a Huragok is supposed to be one of the
members of the Covenant Homogeny and has normally been seen only in their presence. Yet Huragok, 
also known by those in the UNSC as 'Engineers', are primarily pacifistic and dedicate themselves purely 
to repairing and working on any technology around them. This particular one seems to have gotten lost 
and ended up deciding to follow you for the sake of making sure your technology was functioning. Aside 
from melodic whistling sounds that sound slightly similar to Earth whales, Huragoks communicate using 
either sign language with their tendrils or through text messaging thanks to their penchant of being 
biological supercomputers. Huragok are highly prized for being able to fix almost anything they touch, 
and you should expect a lot of questioning if someone spots you with one."
20,,200CP,Igor ,Smash Up,Domain: Assitants,"It's easy to get caught up in the master's enthusiasm. When you get cracking on a project, you have no 
trouble at all attracting any needed number of lab assistants, interns, minions or hobbyists."
21,,200CP,Leonardo Da Vinci ,Europa Universalis,Domain: Assitants,"You stand in the presence of one of the greatest inventors of this age, jumper. He is well known for his 
efforts to build a helicopter and a solar powered beam weapon, even in renaissance times. While he 
lacked the technology to bring his visions into reality and thus, died scorned, you will certainly be able to
bring him the tools and the tech he needs to become the best inventor in the multiverse"
22,,200CP,Mechanical Bird ,Haroun and the Sea of Stories,Domain: Assitants,"Every Water Genie has his or her own steed to travel about between Earth and Kahani. Choose any bird 
or flying thing, or even something mythical with wings - it could even be a strange, unique mix of your 
own invention, like a bird with a snake head and a peacock's tail. You gain a robotic version of that bird, 
which will loyally serve you and help you fly. It can travel at high speeds easily, and communicate with its 
rider telepathically such as to not alter its aerodynamics. Unlike many mechanized things, these 
constructs actually have very lively, passionate personalities. Although it will shut down if its brain-box is 
removed, with the right technical know-how you can repair it easily."
23,,200CP,Sexy Evil Tailor ,Dungeon Keeper Ami,Domain: Assitants,"This is a deed to a tailors shop with included dark elf tailor, he knows exactly what is needed to make a 
person look their most sexy, evil, and impressive, able to create clothes for any shape and size ranging 
from leather strips covering the important bits all the way up to dark billowing cloaks. No matter what 
look you are going for he can help you pull it off and look good doing it, though he normally works for 
gold he will accept any currency and at the end of the week he will give you your portion of the profits 
made from other customers. You will receive a new deed every jump to place as you wish. Beware 
though, he does try to push the leather underwear look"
24,,200CP,Soul of the Forge ,World of Warcraft,Domain: Assitants,"This spirit that manifests as a small, cyclopean golem made of molten metal and shards, the Soul of the 
Forge dwells within the workshops and smithies of metalworkers. So long as it is content, all who work 
within that forge's walls will find their creations blessed: The individual pieces, parts, and techniques 
required coming together that much easier, and the end result being that much more splendid.' In order 
for the Soul of the Forge to dwell, one also requires a small kiln to house the spirit."
25,,300CP,Key of Avatars|Hierarchy of Souls ,Lords of the Night Liches,Domain: Assitants,"-Key of Avatars (200CP) Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Avatars, 
and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal 
investment in that growth.
The Arcana of Avatars first lets you craft, and then manifest, an Avatar. Crafting an Avatar starts modestly
expensive in Arcane, and eventually becomes very expensive, though you only need to craft a given 
Avatar once. Manifesting it costs the same amount, and maintaining it ties up a petty amount of mind 
and intellect to start, growing to a modest amount for the greatest Avatars.
Withdrawing the invested intelligence causes an Avatar to dissipate, but by paying the Arcane cost again 
it may be resummoned. The range that the Arcana of Avatars may summon at is normally dependent on 
your Arcane State, but by buying this perk you gain the maximum range - able to summon an avatar even
into another plane of existence, though you need at least some way of targeting where you want it to 
manifest, of which you know several methods. Normally, it's only possible to manifest a single avatar at a
time.
Most avatars are constructs, though Greater and True Avatars are living creatures. Avatars are immune to
mind affecting spells. You can look through your Avatar's eyes at any time. Your avatar is completely loyal
and incorruptible by any force, magical or mundane. It will work towards your goals even if it doesn't 
know it's an avatar or that you exist.
You may take control of your avatar at any time, and while doing so may channel your abilities through it 
- casting spells, manifesting powers, and so on. Likewise you can use your skills and feats through it. The 
avatar may be aware of this control or explain it away as you like. You may give them orders they will 
follow to the best of their abilities.
There are several different stages of avatar that you can learn to manifest sequentially.
Rudimentary: Has no mind of its own, is very fragile, cannot channel your powers, can't speak, and can't 
pass for a living thing. Will be destroyed by even a light blow. You must actively control it, or it will 
collapse to the ground. Lesser Has the mind of a dumb child but can follow orders, but won't do anything
you didn't explicitly order. Can't yet channel your powers. Might survive a single light blow. Cannot 
speak. Can pass as a living thing at a distance, but is cold and doesn't breath.
Standard: Has the mind of a slow adult. Can speak, but only in your voice. It cannot attack on its own, 
but it is able to be a channel for your powers and skills at this point. Its flesh is warm and it breathes, 
though it won't sweat or bleed.
Superior: Has the mind of an average adult and can think independently as needed. It has the health of 
an average human. It can contact you to get further instructions if it needs them. It can use basic skills on
its own.
Greater: Is actually a living thing a first level character with skills and feats and the attributes of a starting
adventurer, though it will never learn or grow. If you don't want it to, it won't even know it's an avatar, 
believing itself a real person, following your goals subconsciously.
True: Nothing can detect that a True avatar is anything but a normal mortal. It can fall in love, have 
children, learn and grow, though it can't grow beyond a fourth of your own fully realized potential. 
Though it can be better than you at things by specializing differently.
Once you grow able to manifest a True avatar, you'll start the cycle again with a second avatar, starting at 
Rudimentary and growing to True, at which point the cycle will repeat.
-Hierarchy of Souls (100CP) Normally an Avatar is a transitory thing - even the True Avatar. Not for you. 
Once you have manifested a True Avatar you will be able to separate a piece of your soul - the part that's
able to manifest that Avatar, and imbue it with vast quantities of Arcane, raising that Avatar to the status 
of Sub-Soul.
You lose the ability to manifest one Avatar, but in return the Sub-Soul becomes a persistent being you 
don't need to maintain. If it should ever be slain, it will return in a night and a day for no cost. Its 
potential grows, being able to become as strong as you. This is just potential, it will have to get there the 
hard way.
If you let it, it can channel your powers itself - casting your memorized spells, manifesting powers from 
your reserves, and so on. It also counts as a Bound Phylactery. So long as it lives, you will return. You can 
channel spells through it as if you were present, without having to take control of it or use its actions, 
and observe around it, rather then just through its eyes. You always count as touching it for the purposes
of spells (and it counts as 'you' for purposes for self-only spells), and can flawlessly teleport to it over any
distance by the spell, or for a small cost in Arcane. You can store Arcane in it, and both you and it can 
draw upon that Arcane to use Arcana itself. You can hang up to six spells in it for both of your uses, and 
hang another six spells as contingencies. If those contingencies are attack spells, they won't harm your 
Sub-Soul even if they drop down on top of it.
It retains the incorruptibility and absolute loyalty of an Avatar, and counts as a living creature or as a 
construct, whichever is most advantageous at any given moment."
26,,300CP,Dual Wizard ,Generic Hentai Fantasy,Domain: Assitants,"A small time mage with a unique form of illusionary magic. Her personal spell allows her - and you – 
to experience two or more threads of thought/action at the same time. In the real world, you went to work 
and did your job. In the other one, you stayed home and pounded her into the bed. She’s technically a 
virgin, even if she ‘remembers’ losing it a dozen times, and has a vast knowledge of fetishes."
27,,300CP,Talking Head ,Dresden files,Domain: Assitants,"Something between a magical computer and a lab assistant, this Spirit of Intellect would have forgotten 
more about magic than most wizards ever knew if it was actually capable of forgetting without being 
ordered to. Its personality is something between your own and how you think it should behave, which 
means you're probably getting something close to Bob if you're not careful. Aside from dispensing 
forgotten lore, they're able to possess and control things, ranging from friendly dire housecats to giant 
stone lions, and can even act as an emergency mystical battery if need be. Includes a free storage skull"
28,,400CP,Group Mind Bodies ,Generic Lewd Sci-Fi,Domain: Assitants,"Thanks to breakthroughs in neural transference, you are now the hub of a group mind – five more bodies
are linked to your mental command. Because your mental processing is somewhat shared across the five
minds, you will find you have gained a fivefold increase in your multitasking, but your original body 
remains the hub of the network. Any deaths of the extra five group bodies don’t affect you very much 
aside from having to experience them dying, while the death of your primary body will send you home 
barring extra measures. Each of these bodies can be of different appearances, or just copies of yourself. 
Because your senses are also linked, you will experience everything they do. They don’t have minds of 
their own. They retain any modifications you make to them."
29,,400CP,Lab Partner ,Unknown,Domain: Assitants,"They’re not quite as brilliant as you are but that doesn’t make this bombshell of a mage or scientist any 
less exciting to work with. The Lab Partner is your most loyal and useful assistant, and has the Evil Genius
origin along with 600 CP to spend on perks and items from that origin. Any perks from the Evil Genius 
tree that you share with them gain a substantial boost in effectiveness whenever you both use them 
simultaneously; experiments proceed more smoothly, collaborative inventions take much less time to 
perfect, and so on.
A Stroke of Genius (200CP)
No matter where he goes or what he’s doing, an Evil Genius is almost always the smartest person in the 
room, and probably the most perverted too. Your intelligence and creativity stand at the peak of 
ordinary human capacity and your knowledge of the sciences is equally vast, covering many different 
disciplines from robotics to programming to chemistry. Even magic is well within your grasp in any world 
where such power can be learned. But when your genius is fueled by depraved inspiration you can push 
these fields into the realm of comic book super-science. You might design machines that use orgasms to 
brainwash their wearers or discover a new kind of energy produced by sexual desire. The laws of science 
may seem hard and inflexible to others but in your hands they bend and flex like a stripper on a pole.
Ward’s Maxim (200CP)
Does nobody besides you read Lovecraft before they start dabbling with eldritch forces anymore?! 
You’ve learned to never call up anything that you can’t put down and you put that lesson into play by 
ensuring you’ll never lose control of your creations. Any creatures summoned or created by you as well 
as any devices you build have a built-in kill switch which you can use to restrain, kill, power off, or 
otherwise neutralize them at will. The nature of this trigger is up to you as long as the effects are the 
same, but it can only be exploited by you or those instructed in its use by you. You are also automatically 
inoculated against any chemical or biological agents you may create.
Authoritative Lab Coat (100CP)
This white lab coat is somehow viewed as appropriate garb for a scientist, researcher, or doctor 
regardless of what else you are (or aren't) wearing or the situation. In addition, the more you know 
about medical, technical, or scientific matters compared to someone else, the more easily they will 
believe you when you cloak your arguments in such 'facts'.
Ritual Checklist (100CP)
If you write the requirements for a ritual or magical procedure in this blank book then an unseen hand 
will annotate the list to indicate which have been met. The book updates as though you were continually
checking the status of that requirement, giving you notice if that 'virgin sacrifice' manages to disqualify 
herself, but is unable to discern information that you either could not yourself find out or would be 
oblivious to. You will be provided with a replacement notebook whenever the current one is full or has 
been destroyed."
30,,400CP,Canoptek Spyder ,Necron,Domain: Assitants,"Not all troops in the Necron arsenal were once Necrontyr. The Canoptek constructs bear the distinction 
of being entirely robotic in nature. One of the most important of these constructs is the Canoptek 
Spyder, meant to oversee Necron tombs while its inhabitants sleep. To aid in this purpose, the Canoptek 
Spyders are able to manufacture swarms of Canoptek Scarabs and direct them towards intruders, ripping
them to shreds before they even have a chance to scream. Additionally, they are capable of repairing 
Necrons who are damaged beyond even Necrodermis' ability to repair."
31,,400CP,Cu Sith ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Assitants,"A dog that has, out of a deep wish to love and serve you in a better form, transformed into a humanoid 
canine Mamono. Your pet views you as her master and can sense danger and hostility toward you. 
Moreover, her breed is highly intelligent and adaptable, such that she can learn new skills to better serve
you at what you need help with most. If you want help with food, for instance, she could gradually train 
to be a master chef, if you need a loyal knight she can become a fierce warrior, or if you want someone 
to help you with sorcery, she can learn magic spells and rituals; the main requirement is that you must 
be there to teach her some of the steps along the way for her to fully learn. The Cu Sith is normally a dog
from the setting, but if you already own a dog, you may import your dog into the role; in the case that 
your dog already had special attributes or training, her Cu Sith version might start out with special skills –
a hunting dog might now be a full master as a gamekeeper and hunter, and a [D&D] “Blink Dog” with a 
natural ability to teleport might retain that ability and in fact be able to use it better than ever before."
32,,400CP,Delilah the Dark Elf ,MCU,Domain: Assitants,"Not everyone agreed with the homicidal views of Malekith and his horde of Dark Elves in regards to the 
light in the universe. A rare few such as Deliah felt that their time had come and gone, and would resign 
themselves to seeing what this new state of creation could offer. She's very curious as a result, and it's a 
good idea not to leave her alone with any technology for more than ten minutes if you don't want it 
disassembled and in the process of being studied. She's very meticulous at recording anything she finds 
though, so perhaps it might be good to let her work."
33,,400CP,Ex-Sovereign Taylor ,MCU,Domain: Assitants,"The Sovereign species would insist that they are perfect both physically and mentally, and that they are 
the pinnacle of beauty as a result. Taylor would say that's a load of hogwash coming from stagnant snobs
who are too afraid to explore what true beauty is. He's an exceptionally talented geneticist, but was 
banished from his homeworld because he altered his genome to pursue his dream goal of becoming a 
Cuteness Singularity. His words. He's been studying human culture and has entire terabytes of material 
dedicated to his pursuit, and will gladly aid anyone who wishes to improve themselves on a genetic level 
to become a better version. As long as it's cute."
34,,400CP,Friendly Replicator Android v2 ,Stargate Atlantis,Domain: Assitants,"Once McKay (or you) gets the nanite table in Atlans working, you will find blueprints to produce a 
Friendly Replicator Android. FRAN v2 has a blank slate of memories and a somewhat naive and innocent 
personality. It can alter its own appearance and interface with the minds of other humans and 
Replicators (and presumably Wraith) by establishing physical contact, but can't alter her own coding. 
FRAN-2's default appearance can be either the same as FRAN's or to your specifications. Her systems are 
hardwired without the ability to self-replicate. With enough samples and the right skills the blueprints 
allow you to unlock further secrets of the replicators. Try not to accidentally engulf your Warehouse (or any planets) in a swarm of nanomechanical spiders"
35,,400CP,Friends on the Other Side ,Lords of the Night - Zombies,Domain: Assitants,"Ether Zombies oftentimes are guided by strange voices, spiritual presences no one else feels or 
experiences. You are one of them, but the forces guiding you are clearly helping you and furthering your 
interests. You are just given an advantage at... everything. You pick the right door at the end of a riddle 
without reading the riddle. You aim for weak spots you never noticed. You react to attacks you never saw coming. This never gives you more than immediate knowledge, and about things happening right around you 
now. It can help you pick the right answer from a multiple choice question with a definite right answer, 
but can't tell you a friend will betray you next week. Not even if they made the choice right now, unless 
they are in your presence when they make that choice. Within these limitations, they're overwhelmingly strong. If you needed to mechanically represent this for something other than multiple choice (which you'll just always win), think of it like a +10 insight bonus on everything that makes sense for an insight bonus. The forces helping you are outer-planes forces. Powers that hedge them out can interfere. They also work through divination. Powers that protect against divination can also interfere. Though that interference can still say something, and they'll likely pass that on to you."
36,,400CP,God program ,Overwatch,Domain: Assitants,"Well now, this is extremely surprising. You've come into possession of a powerful AI bearing extremely 
close resemblance to those that led the first omnic crisis. This supercomputer is both fully sapient and 
unfalteringly loyal to you. Possessed of the most advanced hardware in this world, it is able to process 
extremely fast calculations. It also possessed the greatest ability of the God programs: the ability to 
infect and control other technology. If its existence becomes known, expect to deal with hostility and 
fear from almost everyone, human and omnic alike."
37,,400CP,Katou Sensei ,Fate Legends: Land of the Rising Sun,Domain: Assitants,"An advanced combat doll, of the same make and potentially even the same appearance as Katou 
Danzou. A highly capable warrior and assassin, this doll is a loyal servant to your cause. But in truth, her 
real value is not in her physical form but the exhaustive database of martial, ninja and even some related
magi techniques that have been uploaded to her mind. Centuries of data and teachings on these 
subjects, enough to bring even a complete amateur to the level of a master with enough time spent. The
doll is an exceptional teacher, able to teach in both theoretical and practical terms to any of her 
students. Oddly enough, the doll prefers to wear glasses while teaching too. In future worlds, similar 
information can be found in the doll's database on local martial and ninja techniques, excluding unique 
or particularly hard to find information."
38,,400CP,Legacy Forger ,The Gamer,Domain: Assitants,"To be a Wuxian is to respect the concept of a Legacy, something that is handed down across the 
generations, gaining something with each new possessor. To be a Forger of Legacies is to be one who can
craft such things, handing them down to others in the expectation that they will grow as they are used, 
then be handed down again, and again, and again. A Legacy can take any shape, such a sword, a staff, a 
cloak, or even a title. When a Legacy is made, the Forger instills in it one singular effect, attack, or 
technique at its most basic level, then passes it off to a Bearer. As long as the Bearer possesses the 
Legacy, they can use that ability, and that ability will grow and grow with usage and insight. Eventually, it 
will reach a point where it can grow no further (level 100 as Jee Han would say), and the Legacy should 
be passed on to another person. In doing so, the Old Bearer can either choose to instill a second ability 
(another effect, attack, or technique) into the Legacy, or to evolve the first ability. Unless the Legacy is 
specifically passed upwards, or there are no descendants, previous Bearers will be unable to use the 
Legacy. Each Legacy is typically dedicated to a unifying concept, such as a family, a nation, or an ideal.
Should keep. Lets you give magical artifacts to organizations, capable of being adapted to new 
circumstances even after you have left.
* Not useful for short term, but still a unique crafting ability, suited for its purpose"
39,,400CP,SPIDERS!,Lords of the Night Vampires,Domain: Assitants,"Some people might not trust you. They might not think you're truly evil, committed to the cause of 
darkness. They might think under all that edge and black makeup, the gentle soul of an elf dwells. Such 
people are fools. Because your soul is made up of SPIDERS!
At least, that's what anyone who sees this perk in action will conclude. You can turn your lifeforce (Blood 
in this jump, but you might have other sources from other lives) into SPIDER. What kind of SPIDER? All 
kinds. You can grow four terrible shadowy limbs from your back, which can be made dexterous to quickly
do delicate work, mighty for heavy physical work or end in terrible blades to use as weapons.
Or you could pour it into your flesh and let spider swarms crawl out of your wounds, vomit them up or 
pull them out of shadows. Such swarms start out as horrible flesh eating monsters who aren't technically
undead simply because they were never alive in the first place (but probably count as undead for 
creature type). But as you add more natures to yourself, you'll be able to make new types of SPIDER 
abomination appropriate to them. You want horrible half-alive alchemical abominations? Cyborg 
Spiders? Data Spiders? Hunger Spirit Spiders? They're all just an appropriate origin or perk away.
To start with, these swarms can consume more life to grow, but if you give them an appropriate nature 
they might feed on other things."
40,,400CP,Stone Creatures ,Ben 10,Domain: Assitants,"Eight figurines that can transform into large stone golems to fight or do physical labor for you. Any lost or
destroyed figurines will reappear in your magic bag (if you have one) or in your warehouse the next day. 
As they are technically sapient you could theoretically free them from your control. They appear to have 
been following you willingly, so as long as you haven't mistreated them they will be amicable towards 
you. Freed stone creatures do not count as companions and must be podded if you wish to keep them."
41,,400CP,The Mortyest Morty ,Rick and Morty,Domain: Assitants,"Those you designate will be at their absolute best when you're around. While the effect diminishes the 
more people you apply this to and they will not be able to do anything that is not possible they will find 
themselves at their smartest, strongest and all around most competent with you in tow."
42,,400CP,Underworld Portal Schematics,Dungeon Keeper Ami,Domain: Assitants,"This set of blueprints shows you how to construct a simple portal to the underworld which will allow 
denizens of this realm to enter your dungeon and join your forces should they so choose. After this jump 
portals to the underworld will instead link to the closest analog (which will may or may not be hell if no other subterranean world exists)."
43,,400CP,Pixl Shaman ,Paper Mario,Domain: Assitants,"Nearly three thousand years ago, a powerful magician among the Ancients created the first Pixls. He 
accomplished this by transferring a spirit into a vessel that he created for a specific purpose, that 
purpose determining the powers of the Pixl created. You have learned this ancient art and are now 
capable of creating Pixls of your own. Pixls are small fairy-like creatures each of which possess a unique 
power that could be found useful by a Hero in this world."
44,,450CP,Ancilla,Forerunner Saga,Domain: Assitants,"Every personal armour comes with its own ancilla, and nearly every forerunner has their own personal armour. Ancilla are also involved in nearly every aspect of forerunner technology. The number of ancillas within the empire likely outnumber the amount of forerunners by several orders of magnitude. This is your own personal ancilla. One of the standard ancilla provided to any citizen. It is programmed to listen to you above all else. It would be stranger if you didn't have one honestly. This ancilla is at the level of a metarch ancilla."
45,,650CP,AI Seed | Muse AI Import ,Eclipse Phase,Domain: Assitants,"-AI Seed (600CP) A potential Seed AI, capable of the feared exponential development curve. It is 
presently inert in a shoebox-sized processor array. Carefully nurtured in a simulspace and given the right 
interaction, information and physical resources, it is fully capable of growing into a ""friendly"" ASI like the 
Prometheans. If left to its own devices, it will grow into something resembling a pre-Fall TITAN essentially
oblivious to any value a human life holds except strategically. The nascent ASI does not require a 
companion slot until it reaches human-level intelligence how long this takes will depend entirely on how 
you choose to let it develop (with no brakes and free access to hardware, it could race to human level in 
less than an hour). Firewall and lots of other people will not be happy if they learn you have this.
-Muse AI Import (50CP) Import into muse AI for 50cp to ensure loyalty of the AI, these seed AIs tend to 
go genocidal otherwise."
46,,800CP,A.I. Chip ,Warlock of The Magus World,Domain: Assitants,"The source of Leylin's strength, this chip was created in another world in another time but that no longer
matters. Through metaphysical means, this chip has now fully merged with your soul and became one 
with your being. These are two of its primary functions: Data Storage and Analysis.
The A.I. Chip stores everything you experience through your senses and records it down, analyzing data, 
gathering samples, importing and organizing your memory, running any types of simulations based on 
that data. For example, using data from a target, the A.I. chip can simulate a path to victory against that enemy, the greater the data the easier it would be one example of a potential result would be fighting an opponent without taking any damage as well as analysing the probability of injury occurring. Estimate wind, trajectory and analysing orbital shooting, and A.R.(Augmented Reality) assist giving a nigh-100% chance 
to hit the target. With this chip Leylin was able to create potions as a master when he was just an Acolyte, optimise an ancient knight breathing technique, refine the bloodline of a Giant Kemoyin Serpent from it's descendents, a very pure bloodline equal to that of a first generation warlock, analyze different layers of the Weave allowing him to gain all spell models of each layer.
The Chip can also scan, analyze and create spell models that would take others months in days and 
transfer it straight into your memory, simulating creation of your own spell models based on data 
analyzed. Scanning you and others and you will get the statistics such as Strength, Agility, Vitality, Spiritual Force, Magical Power, Current Status, Skills, Elements Affinity, Feats, Specialties. This is only an example, you can freely change how your stats are categorized, and what the number represents. If you have access to Mana, Qi, Ki, Chi, Aura, Psionic, Esoteric Energies and such, the A.I. Chip will recognize and establish 
records about it and for others in future worlds. The A.I. Chip is also able warn you against danger,when your stats changed, undesired status afflictions, act as a firewall for your mind, perform surgery on your body, expel poisons, formulate cures for curses, improve recipes, control your energies, detect energy undulations, assist in breakthroughs, can connect to and interact with both magical and scientific technology, get rid of abnormal status, scan down to the sub-atomic level and observe antimatter, controlling your clones, etc. The A.I. Chip's capabilities improve as you and your soul grow stronger, those mentioned here are just PART of what the chip is capable of. Your chip starts out with the processing power of 10 supercomputers, enough to turn 10 years of research into 2 hours. It comes with a maximum scanning range of 10km. Both the A.I. Chip and its scanning ability is undetectable by any means, though it has a difficulty scanning those immensely 
stronger than you, and some are even able to prevent you from scanning them. You automatically know how to use your A.I. Chip to the best of its abilities. While a regular chip can store 10,000 years worth of memories, yours has infinite memory storage and as the A.I. Chip is bonded 
to your soul, everything in its memory is directly accessible to you wherever you desire it to be. Include basic scientific knowledge of Leylin's old world. For an extra 200 CP, your A.I. Chip is upgraded to gain all the same features at the same level of power Leylin's was at at the end of the novel, to the point that it could simulate and analyse universes and Daos of reality, and know everything there is in this verse. You still can upgrade it with the ease of a regular one, just not as much gain until you reach Rank 9/Overgod level. The A.I. Chip does not have any intelligence of its own, but you can import an already existing A.I. into the chip."
47,,1200CP,"Covenanter | Elements Taking Shape | Spreading Nature's Heart | All are the Elements, Elements 
are All ",,Domain: Assitants,"-Covenanter (100CP) Choose one of four elements earth, fire, water, or wind. You can now make 
covenants with elemental spirits and beings that embody that specific element. In exchange for giving 
them energy through various rituals, the elementals you made the pact with will loyally serve you with 
the magical power, while also teaching you and strengthening you in their specialty of magic. Elementals 
often have a mind of their own, so even after you bond with them you'll need to find ways to cooperate 
with them best. While you can potentially bond with multiple elemental spirits, since each individual 
elemental uses some of your energy for the covenant, it may be difficult to keep a lot of covenants 
steady simultaneously. The elemental spirits you bond with can follow you between jumps, but you can 
only have four elemental spirits in active status at one time, with the others being kept in a 
hibernation/stasis state until switched out; even so, the inactive spirits still require a minimum degree of 
energy from you to stay around. Elementals released from your service will likely move to the nearest 
environment that embodies their element; in the case that they have followed you across worlds, they 
will have the option of either returning to their homeworld or choosing to stay in an environment in the 
current setting. You can only purchase this perk once; if you wish for more opportunities, see All are the 
Elements, Elements are All.
-Elements Taking Shape (200CP) You can apply this perk to a specific element you interact with (must be 
the same element chosen for other Elemental Faith-discounted perks). By focusing your power into the 
element, it will begin to gain self-awareness and intelligence, and eventually a human form. If you are 
interacting with a personification of that element but it is not in human form, the perk will help it reach a
humanoid form, and give it sapience if it didn't have it already. Said beings would therefore qualify for 
contracts under Covenanter. Moreover, the perk compels elementals you link your power with to treat 
you in a friendlier manner.
-Spreading Nature's Heart (300CP) For a specific element (must be the same as that chosen for other 
Elemental Faith-discounted perks), you can apply your power to that element to help it expand its 
influence over the region you are in. Earth will create fertility for plant growth and encourage the growth
of land. Fire will encourage warm things in the environment, from sunny days to hot springs, while also 
fueling the hearts of living things with fiery vigor. Water purifies water and protects it against stagnation 
and pollutants, while also multiplying the amount of water in existence. Wind naturally enhances the, 
well, wind, providing sufficient amounts of wind to carry the currents of life throughout the world while 
also tempering more violent aspects such as tornadoes and storms. Apply enough power over an 
extended duration to an area, and the elemental improvement will merge with the natural environment 
and become a permanent fixture of the region. Please note that while the element you choose must be 
the same as that you would choose for other Elemental Faith perks, you can still enhance that element 
even without any other Elemental Faith purchases.
-All are the Elements, Elements are All (600CP) While specific practitioners focus on one element or 
another, the Elemental Faith has always given equal respect to all elements, and you are one of the lucky
few who have mastered them all. You are no longer restricted to a single element for any of the other 
Elemental Faith-discounted perks, and instead you can apply your powers to all of the four elements. 
Furthermore, you can potentially apply your powers to other elements, whether scientific ones or 
metaphysical ones that embody the world around you. Plus, assuming you took Covenanter, you can 
now also make covenants with demi-elementals that only partially embody elements. In the case that 
you didn't purchase any of the other Elemental Faith-discounted perks, don't worry this perk will 
nevertheless significantly improve your affinity with all elements accessible in different worlds, making it easier for you to find, build and strengthen connections to those elements."
