1,,50CP,Pocket Watch ,Wonderland No More,Domain: Time,"An ornate silver watch with an hourglass engraved upon its casing. If you wind back the watch, you will gain enhanced speed/quickness until the watch finishes unwinding or an hour has passed. You can also immediately stop the watch's effect by snapping its case shut."
2,,50CP,Rapid Construction ,Blazing Saddles,Domain: Time,"You are not only a truly excellent carpenter, you are an exceptionally fast worker. Any form of construction or crafting will be completed in a tenth the time it would otherwise take, though your overall quality will suffer if you use this at full effect (times ten). At times two, you'll sacrifice none of the quality, but as you get closer to times ten, you'll sacrifice more and more of it."
3,,100CP,ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED MY GRAVITAS ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Time,"It's terribly serious business being a Ship, Mind or Hub, isn't it? Being responsible for your passengers, having to take care of Big Mind Business, handling all kinds of Ship-related emergencies that need reaction times down to the microsecond. Yet sometimes it's the simple things that make existence worth experiencing. You can always find time to really enjoy your hobbies or celebrations, no matter how trivialthey might seem, and the weight of the responsibility on your shoulders can't crush your joyful and 
pleasant mood if you chose to have one. You can also drop into a whimsical, almost nonsensical persona at the drop of a hat, all the better to annoy much more serious people and Minds."
4,,100CP,Don't Need A Team ,Ace Combat,Domain: Time,"Fighter planes are pretty complicated machines, and more often than not you need a whole crew to maintain them so that they don't break down in the middle of a fight and doom the pilot. You know yourplane well enough to circumvent this issue. You've got just the right idea on what needs tuning up and what needs fixing, along with having the speed to be able to fix a plane up by yourself without the need for a crew in a fraction of the time. Performance issues are a thing of the past for you."
5,,100CP,Fixer ,Smash Up,Domain: Time,You're really good. All your repairs seem to take half as much time as normal. A true miracle worker.
6,,100CP,I Can Whip Something Up ,My Life As A Teenage Robot,Domain: Time,"Working late nights and filling out strange requests is just another Tuesday for a Scientist of your calibre. This perk ensures that you'll never suffer burnout, grow overly bored, lose inspiration, or have your work suffer because of exhaustion. So long as your basic needs are at least barely being met you can keep happily churning out work day after day."
7,,100CP,Simple Scientific Solution ,Tenchi Muyo!,Domain: Time,"This perk grants two features that in universe depend on your setting, out of universe both work unless you desire otherwise.
Slice of Life: Science solves everything, even the little household problems. You can create supertech improvements to common tools and appliances, up to and including automobiles or similar works of engineering. Create dishwashers that can clean dishes in an instant, self heating plumbing or forcefield window panes that act as air conditioners.
SpaceOpera: Well established methodologies and an instinctive grasp of the same allow you to draw conclusions or produce results incredibly fast. You halve the time it takes to gather data, compose research on some subject, or devise a test to prove/disprove something handy for when you have to figure out an enemy fortresses' one weakness"
8,,100CP,Spark Of Genius ,Galactic Civilisations II,Domain: Time,"With the sheer amount and complexity of information involved in next-generation research, most scientific advances slowly progress in vast, city-sized research facilities. But every so often, there's a giantleap forward - a sudden flash of insight that ignores all perceived barriers to scientific advancement and leads to more progress in a few days than you might have otherwise seen in months. Now, you and your people are gifted with just this kind of creativity, experiencing the same kind of sudden technological breakthroughs on rare occasions. This might just make scientific progress a bit more difficult to predict in advance, but you'll always be pleasantly surprised when it happens."
9,,100CP,Gifted ,Milk Hunters,Domain: Time,"Nagisa is the star player of the lacrosse team, and Honoka is a bonafide genius. Now, you too have an incredible talent at a mundane skill. Maybe you’re an idol-grade singer, or you’re working on a best-selling novel, for example?"
10,,100CP,Noble Pursuits ,Kyonyuu Fantasy,Domain: Time,"Surely you don’t spend all your time on politics and courtly intrigue, right? You have to have some kind of hobby to pursue in your spare time, and this thing that you’re passionate about is something you’ve become uncommonly skilled at, not only for a noble but for people in general. Perhaps you’re secretly one of the best chefs in Eurodia, or a master sailor, or even a scholar of magical lore, though merely having knowledge of magic and being able to cast spells are two very different things. Whichever skill you choose, you are one of the best in Eurodia at that skill and can easily advance even further in your specialty should you find new things to learn about it in future jumps."
11,,200CP,Brute Forcing Science ,Hive Queen Quest,Domain: Time,"Science is an amazing thing, it is what brings a being from the caves to the stars and allows them to step beyond the bounds of what nature provides. However science is a never-ending road and the more you learn the more questions you have. Researching a problem takes time, lots of time, and lots of resources. Maybe you wish to take a little shortcut through this process? With the proper handling a well versed team of scientists can do far more than a horde of idiots any day, unfortunately you may not have access to well-trained help. Taking this allows you to get around that little problem, by throwing more people at a project you can actually increase the rate at which you learn and understand things making it much easier for your research to pay off. This quickly hits a limit though and more than 200 people working on a project will probably not net you much more of an increase than 100 (which will already increase your researching skills by a large amount) Obviously quality is better than quantity but sometimes quantity has a quality all of its own."
12,,200CP,Dedicated Research ,Stellaris,Domain: Time,"As a scientist, research is your blood and bone, it is what you do every single day that you work, it is your lifeblood, your passion! So obviously it would be a shame if this passion of yours was interrupted by something such as lack of sleep, or lack of nutrition. Now while researching none of those things will affect your performance allowing you to work at your peak for several days in a row. You may pass out later however."
13,,200CP,Fast Service ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,Domain: Time,"Some might wonder what place a mechanic has on the battlefield, but they clearly never saw a tank take a crippling hit. Fortunately, your skills are such that you can repair many vehicles and devices that would seem at first glance only good for parts, and in a fifth the normal time."
14,,200CP,Insightful ,Galactic Civilisations II,Domain: Time,"Science is, ultimately, the process by which the underlying rules of reality are determined, clarified, and understood. It should not be a surprise, then, that your people's talents at logic, analysis and experimentation provide a noticeable boon to the speed of your R&D efforts? Even better, your followersare highly adept at recognizing dead ends and false results - be they positive or negative. Consequently, your faction won't waste as much time and resources on scientific endeavors that eventually turn out to be 'duds', reducing overall costs of your research as well."
15,,200CP,Machinist ,Gargoyles,Domain: Time,"You are an expert mechanic. You can rebuild and improve a helicopter in 12 hours or create a functional motorcycle from spare parts. If honed, this ability will let you make nearly anything from incredibly advanced robots to nanite swarms in only a few months time."
16,,200CP,Schematics to Time ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Time,"Wasted time is a serious problem for just about any company. And while most managers might think it's because John took an extra 5 minutes for lunch, the real time sink is the direction a project ends up going, as sometimes you go down a rabbit hole trying to fix a problem and take a while to get on the right track, such as looking for a bug in the wrong part of the code. But for you, it's different. For you, every time you settle down to work you get on the right track. From looking for bugs in the right section of code to researching the right function for a problem, your work is now more of a straight line, taking no detours and going down no rabbit holes. If you have a problem, you'll always start in the right place."
17,,200CP,Short Development Time ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Time,"Working at a smaller game company means that sometimes you get contracted out by a bigger corporation to make a game, and they want it ASAP. Well, at least now you can work fast enough to keep up with the deadlines. Usually, anyway. Either way, expect to do half again as much work as you would normally get done in the same span of time, all without losing any quality to your work!"
18,,200CP,Slacking Off ,Generic Factory,Domain: Time,"You will always find some time where you can slack off while working without harming your performance. This doesn't actually reduce the amount of time you need to be at work, just the amount of time you need to be doing work."
19,,200CP,Time Flies ,Lords Of The Night Zombies,Domain: Time,"There are many talented old wizards who have devoted decades of work to achieving immortality, and they didn't even start that search until they were already skilled and experienced in their magic. And many of them fall short. You have a single decade. Good thing you can make the most of your time. Any kind of extended work or project you're working on progresses unnaturally fast. Or at least, your contribution does. Specifically, it goes five times as fast. You can read a book five times as fast, set-up a ritual five times as fast, craft five times as fast, study or do research five times as fast, and so on. This never works on action or dynamic set pieces. You could do five days of ritual work in a single day, but the high point at the end of the ritual, the part that must not be interrupted lest horrible consequences befall everyone? Normal time."
20,,200CP,Time to Cook ,Wonderland No More,Domain: Time,"Wonderland's sense of time is kind of screwy, and it's perfectly reasonable for a chef to go out for a midnight quest to a mountain for an egg and get back before the pot boils over. This perk essentially slows down the progression of time from a narrative standpoint as long as you are focusing on making food that includes everything from acquiring ingredients to preparing the food to setting the table. This does not slow or freeze the movements of those around you, but it basically means that as long as you are focused on cooking, you'll finish everything on time and nothing will interrupt you. For instance, if you are cooking a special potion to boost your troops in time to stop an invasion, you'll get the potion ready on time even if the siege was just an hour away. When you stop doing food-related things, time returns to its normal pace; spell preparations technically count as cooking by Wonderland rules, though."
21,,200CP,What's An Engineer?,Brutal Legend,Domain: Time,"A guy who builds stuff, and now, so do you. Set up and tear down infrastructure in half the time, leaving you with time to rehearse your set, or whatever you'll do with that free time."
22,,200CP,Whittling Away the Time ,Golden Sky Stories,Domain: Time,"Time seems to fly whenever you’re having fun doesn’t it? One moment it seems like you just started, and the next it’s already over. To be honest, it seems that the older you get – or rather, the more experienced you get – the quicker everything seems to move along. For a brief period of time, you can accelerate any actions you are performing, whether it is casting a spell, or just reading a book. This extends to even group activities as well, affecting all of your allies involved."
23,,300CP,Workaholic ,Sonic the Hedgehog,Domain: Time,Sometimes you wonder how some geniuses are able to build entire armadas within days or weeks of their last defeat. You become a walking factory of production. Building in masse is something that comes without issue to you. That one bot that took a week to build? Now that one bot is now 5. Or roughly 3x the size it was before. How do you even have the resources to build so much you say? The hell if I know.
24,,400CP,Arsenal Of Destruction ,Galactic Civilisations II,Domain: Time,"To build a fleet capable of defending your empire (or conquering a rival's) is not a trivial task. Parts and resources need to be brought in from dozens of industrial sectors, crews and soldiers need to be trained, and there's always the dilemma of what exactly you'll go for - larger numbers of small combat craft, or a few, powerful warships to dominate one sector at a time. Or at least it used to be. Streamlining your industrial capacity is not easy, but when it comes to military-industrial power your people are nothing short of savants. You'll be able to build more ships, faster and cheaper than before and most amazingly, this effect becomes more pronounced the greater your production target's overall size, complexity, and cost are. Heavy Fighters' small size means they don't have that many ways to optimize production, but Frigates are already substantially easier, and Dreadnaughts? Well, by the time you're building those behemoths you shouldn't be surprised if you start getting almost twice as much bang for your buck. Possibly literally, if you like using missile weapons."
25,,400CP,From Parts of Bodies to Bodies of Their Own ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Time,"There used to be double-headed dragons and the like, but the two heads didn't fit well with the Mamono aesthetic, so instead each head became its own separate dragon. Whatever form you have chosen for the jump can now at will switch to and from a two-headed form. But that's only the beginning. Whenever your current physical form has multiple consciousnesses or thinking body parts, you can split yourself up into multiple individuals, each sibling being the manifested version of the individual component. For instance, if you had two separate heads or even ten or more, each head would become a separate sibling. It even applies to odder, independent body parts, like say literal snake hair or a tail that can bite or maybe even a belly mouth if it can think for itself. Also, if you have distinct and separate mental personas inside you, you could have each persona become its own separate body."
26,,400CP,Heavengazer Tower MK.II ,Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse,Domain: Time,"A far more advanced version of the Heavengazer Tower of Radiance, this version allows you to accelerate time up to a million times with no energy drain in you or the Chaosverse. The world on the inside is at the size of a Chaosworld, and any restrictions on food and sustenance being formed on the inside are now also gone."
27,,400CP,High Speed Creationist ,The Weakness Of Beatrice,Domain: Time,"There's no reason to bother with hours or days of waiting around for a potion to be ready, especially not when you're in the deep labyrinth, monsters are bearing down on you and your allies are injured. You've got no time for it and thus waste none, as your crafting and mixing abilities work at an insane pace. You can mix potions in seconds that take hours normally, even turning enemies into potions as you fight them if you're using the right sort of potion recipe. The way you smith or build items is just as fast, finishing swords in minutes or whole houses in hours. Combat crafting might have been seen as impossible but you're about to prove everyone wrong."
28,,400CP,HIVE PROCESSING ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Time,"Different to the way Culture Minds are made, your mind is a collective process of many (from hundreds to hundreds of thousands) of sub-minds running on a Very Fast Substrate. These sub-minds might themselves be artificial intelligences, copies of a singular Mind-State, or they might be a 'population' of uploaded bio minds all running at Mind speeds. Regardless, the collective output of these separate sub-minds still manages to be you. It is only natural, then, that you have a ludicrous ability to multitask even beyond that of regular Minds, able to remain aware and focused on a great many thousands to millions of inputs without sacrificing processing speed or power, and when considering a task with anything but the smallest amount of attention, your mind naturally analyses the problem from many different points of view. Anyone attempting to Compromise you has to Comp all of your sub-minds without the other sub-minds noticing and doing something about it."
29,,400CP,I Know What We're Going To Do Today ,Phineas and Ferb,Domain: Time,"24 hours just doesn't seem like enough time to get stuff accomplished, but you'd be surprised what determination (and this perk) can get you. You can now complete days and even weeks worth of work in just a few hours, and this effect increases tremendously when you have a few helpers, to the point where a small team can work with you to complete years worth of work in a simple afternoon."
30,,400CP,Into The Future ,Galactic Civilisations II,Domain: Time,"Know where you're going - or you'll just get lost. Science has a vast spectrum of possibilities open to a society, from advanced construction methods and ecological engineering to weapons technologies and faster FTL drives. It's enough to make one's head spin - but your people know how to stay grounded, possessing a nearly prescient ability to determine how useful any particular scientific effort is going to be, how long it might take before it starts to offer tangible results, and even what further options it might lead to. This doesn't eliminate the need to figure out what the options are to begin with, and you might still have to choose between developing a better Hyperwarp or pursuing Discovery Spheres instead - but you'll at least be able to make an informed decision on which path to pursue."
31,,400CP,Magical Assembly ,Generic Builder,Domain: Time,"Rather than use tools for your building, you've learned how to assemble and disassemble things using magic. This increases your Building speed by half again."
32,,400CP,Manufacturing Line ,Valkyria Chronicles,Domain: Time,"You've always been of the opinion that technology advanced too slowly before you arrived, but now you can apply that to the physical world as well! Any building process you oversee, whether it be the forging of a sword or an entire tank factory, will now produce results twice as fast and with half the required materials used."
33,,400CP,One-Man Industry ,God Catching Meister,Domain: Time,"Despite being chained to the forge for hours on end, alchemists can make just a handful of works per day. Mixing, forging and enchanting take time and finesse, after all. Those who make items in masse tend to vomit works of low quality. In face of that, you trained and mastered the art of making things really quick without a loss in quality. About ten times as faster as your peers, in fact. While an alchemist with your same rank would take an hour to make a fire sword, you in the same span of time can make ten, and even give each different powers. This bleeds out to other aspects in your life. Time is money, after all."
34,,400CP,Rapid Engineering ,Honor Harrington,Domain: Time,"When it comes to technology, quality may beat quantity, but quantity has a quality of its own. A quality you well understand. You have a deep knowledge and skill at building shipyards and support systems, not to mention ships and their weapons, that focuses on building a lot of them very quickly, instead of building them to be the best in the world. Your product may not be the most lethal or best defended or longest sensing in the galaxy, but you know how to churn out entire fleets of the stuff in the time it would take others to make a prototype."
35,,400CP,Researcher ,Age of Mythology,Domain: Time,You are far faster at designing and discovering new technologies. Inspiration and breakthroughs hit you far more often.
36,,400CP,Savvy Sultan ,Macross,Domain: Time,"When people think of building things, they think of you. Provided you had the resources and the understanding of the technology, you could construct all manners of machines in a fourth of the time it would normally take. By yourself. You're no slouch with any of your tools either, wielding them with the precision of a machine with no loss of speed. Quality and a deadline? No problem."
37,,400CP,Shipping the Product ,F.E.A.R.,Domain: Time,"Prototypes are one thing, but what about actually getting the damn thing distributed? An item or weapon doesn't help anyone if it's the only one of its kind. You will find your ability to create has increased dramatically in efficiency, letting you use the materials for three of the same items to actually make five while streamlining production lines rather quickly. As a bonus, logistics have increased enough where your shipped supplies are harder to intercept, keeping any allies you have fresh with resources!"
38,,400CP,Under Pressure ,Stargate Atlantis,Domain: Time,"Work that would take a whole team a week to do, you can do by yourself in a day...when you're properly motivated. Unfortunately that proper motivation involves imminent demise: a gun held to your head, an incoming blast of solar radiation, anything that would wipe you or your friends out. The closer your death approaches, the faster and better you work just keep in mind that some tasks are too large for even your accelerated competency to complete."
39,,400CP,Unravelling ,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Time,"Sprinting is great and all, really, but it's not much use in life. How often is raw speed in that sense going to help, in anything from typing to fighting? But it looks like it's actually quite fitting for you. The faster you become in raw movement speed, the faster you are able to do any task at all. Becoming able to move faster than the speed of sound would let you accomplish hours of work in just minutes, with no loss in quality, consideration or effective time spent on the project. You'll be moving and acting faster but be just as effective as if you took as much time as you normally would on the task you're working on."
40,,400CP,Wasteland (Re)Builder ,Modded Fallout,Domain: Time,"From hand-crafted bullets in the Mojave to entire settlements near Boston (and probably a gauntlet made from a dismembered Deathclaw's ah, claw) no matter where you are, going through Fallout means making stuff - and usually out of scraps lying around, too. You're good at it, though. More than good, even. You now have a mental 'build menu' you can use to create or modify items, ranging from consumables or ammunition to infrastructure as large as an entire house. You'll still need to know exactly what you're building, of course, though the menu automatically updates to incorporate your skills and abilities (including whatever you can create from settings beyond Fallout). But perhaps the most amazing part of this power isn't just that it gives you a quick and easy overview of what you can make (and what materials you'll need)... but once you're ready to actually get your hands dirty, the crafting process is nearly instantaneous. So yes, you can build a thousand .50 Match rounds or a small town's worth of concrete fortifications in under a minute if you really felt the need."
41,,600CP,Build Rome ,Gundam - After Colony,Domain: Time,"You have a thing about building things-you're damn fast, and you're damn good. They say you can't build 10 Mobile Suits in a week? Hah! You'll build twice that much and you'll build them to last! You simply have utter talent in the way of making things quickly-enough to double production, maybe even triple production if you work at it enough, and they'll come out with no loss of quality. In addition, these constructions will last-barring sudden disaster and similar, they'll easily last several decades of constant abuse, and if they're upkept and repaired they could even last centuries with no troubles."
42,,600CP,Clock of Ages ,Chronicles of Narnia,Domain: Time,"An enormous mechanical clock attached to your Cosmic Warehouse. By precisely adjusting various gears and chains within this clock, you can control the rate that time flows in your warehouse relative to the world outside, to a maximum of twice as fast and a minimum of half as fast. For each Jump you've completed, increase this cap by 20%. After 5 jumps, you'll be able to speed things up to three times as fast or slow them down to 1/3. After 10 jumps, you'll be able to speed things up to four times as fast, and so on. If you've got any similar pocket dimensions, you might figure out a way to hook them up to the clock as well."
43,,600CP,Deus Vult ,Youjo Senki - Saga of Tanya the Evil,Domain: Time,"The creation of cutting edge technology is an odd process. Normally, it would be long hours of research and testing followed by tiny advances. You on the other hand, by some method, have been inspired. Your specialty lies in completely eschewing the normal methods in order to create prototype technology that far outpaces everything - in exchange for vast amounts of instability. If you manage to reign in your genius, and ego, creating something halfway between genius and the status quo will leave you with something more powerful, but also easier to mass produce."
44,,600CP,Fast-Charging ,Heat Signature,Domain: Time,"Your rechargeable equipment recharges 225 times as fast. 24 hour recharge times become 16 seconds. This effects cell phones, laptops, etc. but it doesn't give them a self-powering source. Objects cannot benefit from this while in active use (A laptop in sleep mode is not in active use, but is when mining bitcoin)."
45,,600CP,Gadgeteer ,Totally Spies Martin Mystery,Domain: Time,"Not only do you have the knowledge and resources to produce all of WOOHP and the Center's gadgets quickly and efficiently, but you'll never run out of ideas for new gadgets, and you'll be able to incorporateany other technologies you know seamlessly."
46,,600CP,Goibnu ,Irish Mythology,Domain: Time,"The greatest of the Tuatha smiths, Goibnu could create a spearhead with three strikes of his hammer, and it would be so sharp the man it cut would surely bleed to death. Like this legendary smith, you can forge or assemble anything you've the materials for, no matter how complex or intricate, in moments and whatever you forge shall be of mythic quality, whether armor lighter than cloth and harder than a mountain or plows that can turn over ten acres with one pass. Truly you are worthy to be called the smith of the gods.
FREE: Metal-Worker: Wouldn't be much of a smith without the basics. You know how to mine, refine and work all forms of metal, and are well-steeled for the hard labor and heat of the forge.
FREE: Nimble Fingers: There is none better for fine detail work than yourself, Your precise and certain hands can make etchings too small to be seen with the unaided eye, and anything you have even a minute to embellish is beautiful to behold."
47,,600CP,Instant Construction ,Fallout 76,Domain: Time,"Rebuilding Appalachia will take quite a lot of time and effort, so let's remove at least some of that. If you know how to build something, and have the resources available to you, you can consume those resources and snap that item into existence nearby you. You remove the time needed for construction, and the risk of manufacturing mistakes. However, you can only do this in areas that are either owned by you, or have no one else nearby to potentially contest your claim."
48,,600CP,One-Man Assembly Line ,XCOM,Domain: Time,"You really liked playing with building blocks as a kid. Now that you're all grown up, the world is your playground. Your knowledge of construction and engineering is unprecedented, and making a jet engine from spare parts over a weekend is your idea of fun."
49,,600CP,SCP-2400 ,SCP Foundation,Domain: Time,"Wow, really? Alright, well, I guess you have an eye for the good stuff, then, even if it is just a chunk of concrete with a door on it. Inside this door is a blank, featureless, white expanse with no apparent limit, or defined edges, with unidentifiable, indestructible white, ""ground,"" an atmosphere consistent with the terrestrial location of the object, and a star stuck at what appears to be twelve noon. When the door's open, time flows normally; when it's closed, however, time inside flows at one hundred and forty(140) seconds inside per second outside. The icing on the cake? There's no downside, aside from accelerated aging, and that doesn't affect you, now does it."
50,,600CP,Seed of The Singularity ,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Time,"They say that the future begins with an idea, but that's not true. It begins when you make an idea reality. You're not just someone that is content to fiddle the technology that's already there, you're one of the minds that could shatter everything we thought we knew. Your ability to innovate and invent is awe inspiring, doing the work of years in scant months. What you piece together in your lab to test a concept would count as a production model to anyone else, and your actual finalized designs are nothing short ofpure brilliance. This applies just as well to actual discovery, burning through fields of testing and examination with incredible speed. Your work alone could build the entire future if you had the resources, and if you can survive the people who would kill for the things you can make."
51,,600CP,Silken Mountainriver Diagram ,Talisman Emperor Mortal Dimension,Domain: Time,"This Immortal Artifact takes the form of a painting 52 picturing a verdant landscape with majestic mountains and rivers so lifelike that they appear to move. With a small amount of essence, a cultivator can enter the painting which expands to the size of a world. Time flows more swiftly inside the painting, allowing a year to pass when the outside world only experiences a single day. While plants and animals grow older accordingly, sapient beings still only age a single day, making it ideal for cultivation. The owner of the Silken Mountainriver Diagram can control who enters it, but cannot directly force them to exit it. Anything which can become an attachment to your Warehouse can instead be placed inside the Silken Mountainriver Diagram."
52,,600CP,Steel Driving Man ,Generic Factory,Domain: Time,"Whenever you are working with a machine you find that you can always keep up with it, you can practically run an entire assembly line all on your own and still find time for a smoke break.
* Scales indefinitely allowing any machinery that can be operated to benefit from perks that improve use of tools."
53,,600CP,Technological Upgrade ,World Seed,Domain: Time,"Spaceship captains, rulers of both kingdoms and planets alike, and people similarly reigning over the masses or in possession of a vast amount of land have access to a special kind of system in Neolife. A sort of management menu, it allows people to upgrade their territories in two kinds of ways: the first is a technology upgrade, which a ruler could use to add irrigation to a field, or to increase the defence of a city. If there is a design provided, it will be instantly built once the upgrade finishes in around a week."
54,,700CP,Scientist: Machinery | Strong Spark ,Girl Genius,Domain: Time,"-Scientist (100CP) You have a DOCTORATE! And skill in ACTUAL SCIENCE! That doesn't need you to go crazy to work! Admittedly, it won't break the fabric of space and time, but meh. Tradeoffs everywhere you go. You're highly trained in one field, and can easily apply its principles to your work. After all, building a crazed abomination upon the natural order usually requires at least a smidgen of understanding of which bones are supposed to go where (Even if you end up changing them around a little). At the very least, you're also in the genius range of standard intelligence.
-Strong Spark (600CP) Rather than having a weak Spark (Like a PEASANT who took the Spark Perk, which this is incompatible with) you have an extremely powerful one. You don't limit your scientific explorations to a single topic, but are a master of anything that meets your eye (well, at least once you're in the Madness Place). You go further and farther than almost anyone, and when you get working, you quickly stop caring about things like fundamental laws and nature of the universe and ... well, pretty much anything. Warping the fabric of reality is a pretty common thing. Unfortunately, it's also significantly harder to get OUT of the Madness Place, and you get sidetracked pretty easily as well. Last week you were trying to get a stain out of your carpet, and woke up with an army of death-ray-wielding mice obedient to your commands! MWAHAHAHA."
55,,800CP,Freak of Nature: Formation Specialization ,Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms,Domain: Time,"The Three Realms, despite being a backwater to others in the Primordial Chaos, are filled with people that would be considered utter monsters by any outsiders. People who manage to rise above their sub-par cultivation methods and produce monsters on the level of Houyi, Ji Ning, Nuwa, Subhuti, Tathagata, Suiren, Shennong, and Fuxi, all of whom would absolutely be feared for their genius. Of course, you are no different, being an absolute freak of nature in the arts of cultivation and understanding of the dao. Getting to the level of mastering a Grand Dao would take you maybe thirty years or so, and becoming an Elder God would take you maybe twenty thousand years through sheer brute force. Hell, even becoming a World level expert would be an inevitability rather than a mere possibility, though the time it would take you could vary widely. And that's without any specializations. You may pick one aspect of Cultivation such as Heartforce, Sword Arts, or Spacetime Techniques, in which you absolutely excel, to the point where it would allow you to fight others one level higher than you, and train in it at an absolutely astonishing pace, reminiscent to Ji Ning's progress in the Sword Arts. For an extra 400 CP, undiscounted, you can pick up one more specialization. You may purchase as many specializations as you wish."
56,,800CP,The Man who understood Infinity,Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse,Domain: Time,"One such as you who has a shocking and unseen talent can feel forced into a single path, the one you are best at. But you did not become the greatest in the Three Realms simply for the sake of being another specialist. No, you're a Genius, with a capital G. Whatever you find your most interesting specialization, you can uplift other side projects to train just as fast. There is one caveat however, that being that this can only be applied to five specialties at a time, though you can switch between them with little to no fanfare. If you're a master of the sword but have a deep admiration for Spacetime, there's no need to worry about talent anymore, you'll have enough to get to speed."
57,,800CP,Thirty Thousand Seeds ,Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse,Domain: Time,"It's tedious to continually check in on all of your projects, especially when they're on the other side of the known Chaosverse. Scientific endeavors need maintenance and tweaking, raising a student might not lead to them being useful in any way. Thus it's probably a good thing that side projects like that always advance as if you put 100% of all your effort into them, and always come back to benefit you in some way, no matter how miniscule. Leaving a kid you found with some techniques might let him skyrocket in strength to one day come help you in a war. Creating a race of ultimate warriors might see them naturally evolve to fulfill that directive, maybe even evolving traits that make them stand above the rest. Casting aside a single Godgem to create a Chaosworld may lead to the creation of the greatest genius in the history of the Chaosverse. Though that one's still pretty unlikely. Even if these side projects don't help you much, they'll never be a detriment. Go ahead and seed the entire Chaosverse with your power."
58,,800CP,We Need Reserves | Special Attention ,Gundam - Advanced Generation,Domain: Time,"-We Need Reserves (400CP) When you're fighting a war, you know what you need-you need troops, you need squadrons; you need a fully-armed army. You can't fight a war without numbers, and so you can modify designs to give you just that-numbers. Your MS production capability will multiply to near 4x levels, with only a negligible decrease in quality. You can also, with time and patience, apply this design philosophy to other products.
-Special Attention (400CP) When you're fighting a war, you know what you need-you need guardians, you need shields; you need a well-armed force. You can't fight a war with a thousand scratches, and so you can modify designs to increase individual performance and quality-the biggest boon is that this only negligibly increases production times or costs, at the benefit of having much higher quality Mobile Suits. And you can apply this to other designs as well, with time."
