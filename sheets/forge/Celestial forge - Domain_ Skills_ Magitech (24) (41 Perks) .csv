1,,100CP,Build That Wall | Phonograph ,Bastion,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Build That Wall (100CP) You know the basics of Caelondian technology. You understand how to harness the semi mystical power of Cores and turn it into usable Mantic energy, to power basic machinery, shortrange flying machines, computers, and a variety of other uses. More interestingly, you can use Core power to reinforce existing structures, running a Matic current through it to enhance whatever physical properties it possesses, usually durability, though other uses are possible. This is what allowed structures like the Rippling Wall and the Bastion to survive the Calamity as well as they did. You also gain basic skill for mundane construction.
Phonograph (0CP) An old­fashioned hand­cranked phonograph. Very sturdy, gives much higher­quality sound than you’d expect. Has a single record with the full OST for the Bastion game, as well as several additional Caelondian and Ura folk songs."
2,,100CP,Research ,Rance 02,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Magic, a force that works over completely different laws than the normal physics of the world. You know the value of it, but are also aware of the wonders in technology. As such you, in secret from the rest of the students, have been advancing in the research of mixing the advancing technology and magic. Learning the best ways to fuse both to create something more powerful."
3,,100CP,Sorcery Capsules ,I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"The impossible marriage between science and magic allowed the creation of these small capsules, which purpose is to store intricate spells for their later use. Think of magical grenades with multiple types. You gain a whole dozen of these small artifacts, as well as the instructions of how to make more and fill them with all kinds of spells."
4,,100CP,Tech Wizard ,Devil Survivor,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"You're really good with machines. You just sort of understand how they work, better than most. But not just regular machinery, no. You've learned how magitech works too, to a certain extent. COMPs are incredibly powerful tools, allowing users to summon demons, learn magic, go beyond normal human limits, and fight on the same level as demons. You can't build one yet, but you've figured out how they work, and even how to modify the coding to a certain extent. Won't the Shomonkai be surprised to find out they're no longer safe from their own toys?"
5,,200CP,Antimatter Manipulation Principle ,Final Fantasy XIII,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"You understand the science at work behind Cocoon's technology. You may not have the equipment to reproduce it, but you can manipulate gravity to a limited degree even without it - enough to save you from falls.
With suitable tools however, you could make all sorts of equipment and mechanical wonders, even up to graviton cores that can maintain giant aerial defence platforms."
6,,200CP,Antimatter Temporal Principle ,Final Fantasy XIII 3,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"The same antimatter manipulation principle developed by the scientists of ancient Academia was banned by the Fal'Cie Pandaemonium in the recent years, and all its researchers vanished. After careful research, you've come to realize why. Through extensive manipulation, Chaos itself can be controlled with AMP, and while the degree of control you can exert on it is limited even you can stop time for five seconds at will. However, you also move at a reduced pace, as the sheer effort of manifesting this unnatural phenomenon drains you in more ways than simply energy.
After trying this twice in rapid succession, you found yourself completely drained, but if you alone could perform such a feat even with significant support from any piece of ancient AMP technology then perhaps the Fal'Cie banned it out of fear that it would evolve to something greater
Without this research available, and with most of the team lost, you wonder if it would have been impossible otherwise to reconstruct this technology. After all, only the significant presence of Chaos provoked the research to begin with, long after Gran Pulse had fallen."
7,,200CP,Light-Tech ,Nexus 2.0,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"The primary advantage common goblins make use of is technology, crossing several fields of study from alchemy to metalworking and engineering to medical sciences. However, their greatest technologies are their Light-Tech, technology that interfaces directly with their Light and other supernatural powers, such as Mist once they unlock it. By default, this allows them to focus their Light through any tech they make to enhance its function, but with practice, they can extend this to other sources of power they may possess. This can also be used on objects they didn't craft, but is instead familiar with, however it will have some loss in effectiveness the less familiar with the object they are."
8,,200CP,"Magitech Augmentation Theories, 14th",Final Fantasy XIV,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"The Garlean use of Magitek doesn't just end with automatons. Many of the weapons, armor, and even day today objects have benefited from the implementation of magitek. Inside this textbook is a collection of theories and applications that have been tested and improved. You could most likely learn from these theories and apply the principles of magitek to any inanimate object .We've seen from live samples that Magitek doesn't just enhance the magical properties of an item it seems to add in neat little quirks like transformation sequences and magic resistant coatings as well. It's likely you could scale this up to high levels with a substantial amount of further analysis."
9,,200CP,Ride the Winds of Inspiration ,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Mania, a strange phenomenon. It is not generated by geniuses alone. Instead, all kinds of mortal thought can generate low amounts of Mania, with scientific or mathematical thought generating more, and the sort of thought one might call ""revolutionary"" (politically, scientifically, ethically, it doesn't seem matter) generating the most. In this world there is a phenomena known as 'Maniac Storms' and thanks to your outsider's perspective you've hit upon an idea. If there are 'storms' of Mania then there must be 'winds and currents' by applying this theory to your wonders you can create wonders that need no Mania to feed on, though they still will cause Havoc in the hands of a mere mortal. This technique does rely upon the winds of mania as a whole though so be careful, it could fail in lands where the local 'winds' aren't strong enough such as a rural backwater town or an amish village. In lands without proper technology you need to look for innovation, for it really is the thought that counts."
10,,200CP,System Worker ,Fate/Extella,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"A position normally only entrusted to neutral Casters but the story of this world proves that's not really how it works out. The Moon Cell has decided to make you one of the system maintenance workers, Servants in charge of caring for the virtual reality within the computer structure. Superhuman skill with computers and most technology is yours now, mostly focused on repairing and maintaining it. Even alien technology, like that of Velber, is relatively easy for you to get in working order and keep it that way. You're not able to alter much, the Moon Cell keeps that knowledge out of your hands with just this, but making new stuff isn't too hard. You don't know how to create the highly complex systems that form the core of the Moon Cell but pretty much anything on Earth till the year 2030 is easy to construct. Those lunar databases are good for something."
11,,200CP,Technomage ,Libriomancer,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"While not a magic user per se you have the unique ability to make magic and technology play along together in just the right kind of way. Perhaps you can take a fictional operating system out of a book and install it on a real computer. Or create a self replicating swarm of nanomachines from a sliver of magically created tissue. Whatever it is, you can do it and are likely to be the envy of your magical peers."
12,,200CP,Technomage | Defensive Sign “Directional Shield” | Bomber Jacket | Call sign | First generation Striker ,Strike Witches,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Technomage (200CP) Strike Witches generally rely on service crews to tune and repair their striker, but not you. You'll be able to do the job much better and be able to modify your Striker to aid you focus your speed, defense or attack if you have offensive magical abilities. If you have technology from other jumps, you'll be able to incorporate them into your striker and with enough time make one from scratch.
Defensive Sign “Directional Shield” (0CP) All Strike Witches are trained to produce a 2 dimensional circle of energy a short distance directly in front of them which can deflect light attacks. You cannot fire a weapon through a shield.
Bomber Jacket (0CP) Discount Army Surplus offering customised bomber jacket for free to any and all of our STRIKE WITCH HEROS. Call through and give your Regiment, Call-sign and Address and will mail out in a day with Regiment patch and Call-sign embodied
Call sign (0CP) Attention all military personnel, due to the recent alliances several documents of low importance have gone missing. It is important that you announce your call sign to your direct superior as soon as possible. All your comrades will know you by it, and if you don‟t tell us one will simply be appointed to you during your next Sortie.
First generation Striker (0CP) A basic propeller driven Striker unit. Very agile but unable to break the speed barrier."
13,,200CP,Weird Science ,Bleach,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"While the rest of the Soul Society resembles feudal Japan, the Shinigami R&D area is the exception. Like them you can create devices that run off of spiritual power, and can, in time create mod souls as well."
14,,300CP,Playing with Dolls,Fate/Legends Land of the Rising Sun,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Ever have the ninja pushed for more tricks and tools to keep them ahead of their foes. It's only logical that their desires for a greater advantage over the raw power of the samurai would lead to such advancements in technology. The Danzou puppet is the culmination of incredible science and magic coming together as one, creating an artificial lifeform filled with the experiences and skills of many great ninja, equipped with advanced technology and powerful magic. It's also something you have the knowledge to make and more besides.
You have the training in various disciplines to create advanced puppet bodies like this, as well as the weaponry and technology that Danzou makes use of in that body, even things like missiles. This covers both ordinary scientific knowledge and occult magecraft focused towards artificial bodies like this. It's quite possible to turn an existing person into one of these puppets, albeit more difficult than making it from scratch.
One of the more impressive parts of this field is the techniques that allow for the recording and uploading of knowledge or skills that people possess. With a willing or incapacitated subject, you know how to examine what they know and copy it over to another person. Your studies in this field have also helped you realize how to capably combine magic with technology, creating things where the two work together to support and enhance both sides' effects instead of interfering. While you can't alter the basic metaphysics behind things such as mystery, you do know how to work it to your advantage."
15,,400CP,A World Is A Living Thing ,Warhammer 40K - Craftworld Eldar Jumpchain,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Among the Exodites, the Infinity Circuit is known as the World Spirit, and upon the death of an Exodite, this network absorbs their soul, thus keeping them from the clutches of Slaanesh and allowing those still living to commune with them. Now you too bear the knowledge by which one might forge this great and intricate grid of stone circles, obelisks, and menhirs. It will take some time, of course, to cover an entire world - likely more time you will have in a given journey at any rate - but it is entirely possible to produce a smaller version over say, the course of three years, protecting the souls of those within an area about the size of a small township. May the dead know peace at last."
16,,400CP,Artificer ,Exalted - The Dragon Bloods,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Arguably the key reason Lookshy remains such a powerful independent nation is due to the vast stockpile of first age technology it maintains from the ruins of Deheleshen, the ruined city Lookshy was founded on. Therefore one of the key priorities of the general staff is to ensure that these artifacts are serviced and cared for properly. Because most of the skills required were lost in the usurpation, many weapons are considered one use only and as such only used in the most extreme situations. Those that can be repaired however are instrumental in maintaining the military presence of this singular city. This means that there has to be dragonblooded, skilled in artifice, dedicated to maintaining these tools; with the specialized skills and rare knowledge required to do so.
By taking this perk, you would possess the knowledge about how to repair and maintain the complex artifacts owned by Lookshy. As well as this thanks to ages of study and practice you will have an instinctive understanding of how these wonders operate, meaning attempting to fix more advanced artifacts and creating your own will be much easier in the future."
17,,400CP,Bonesinger ,Warhammer 40K - Craftworld Eldar Jumpchain,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Dear child, the Eldar do not simply build their wondrous technology. Instead, they rely on the power of song to shape their creations into being. This is a very demanding process, which requires a unique mix of artistic and scientific knowledge. Most importantly of all, a strong mind is necessary for this process. Bonesingers sing a psychic song, and its melodies form a psychoactive material from the warp itself, called Wraithbone. This lightweight material is stronger than titanium but is far more flexible and weighs less. Additionally you can psychically grow crystals that are the basis of their laser & lance technology. You have the knowledge and ability to sing any Eldar technology and any technology you know into being and more than that, eons of experience in doing so. Even so, the more complex an item is, the more time it takes to create said item. A whole choir of Bonesingers is required to create large and complex items such as starships and Eldar Titans unless you are willing to sing alone for years. With enough time, perhaps, you could even sing forth a brand-new Craftworld but how and where would you acquire that much time? Even an Eldar is not immortal."
18,,400CP,Bio-Magic Research ,Monster Girl Quest,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"The power of mamano in this world is truly devastating. You have seen it yourself as individual monsters can destroy entire towns with ease. They called you a fool for trying to dive into the abyss of dark power that lies inside their complex, magically strengthened genomes; you have proved them very wrong. Your analysis of magically strengthened clusters of dna structures have given you the knowledge to clone biological Monsters, even incorporeal ones such as ghosts, specifically by developing their bodies in a vat. More powerful bodies and species require exponentially longer times to develop, with monsters such as the full power Lilith and Lilim or the Guardians of the Directions taking up to five years, however,
innovations, practice, and existing infrastructure can reduce this time. Furthermore in order to clone such creatures you need a DNA sample. These monsters can be given monster behavior or monster girl behavior depending on what you wish for at the time of cloning. A monster girl will have personality influenced by the species of 
which they are derived. They are not inherently loyal to you so befriending them would be helpful, though they will start with a positive disposition toward you. If you have this perk and Artificial Life-Form Development, all Monster Girl’s created using either perk can be given Heat of the Moment, Trained Endurance, and Sexual Weapon. "
19,,400CP,Machine Madness ,Dragon Ball GT,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"So much of the universe relies on Ki to grant them power or natural biological abilities. Why pursue scientific perfection when you're already able to claim to be perfect? Why NOT pursue scientific perfection? Despite the lack of need, you buried yourself into science and found ways to use technology to match mysticism. So long as you have a good understanding of how a supernatural effect or technique or ability works, you are able to replicate it through technology, creating a device or being capable of performing that effect or technique or ability. The method, resources, cost and so on may change to fit the new medium but the ultimate result will be as if you had used that magical spell yourself...just through the lens of beautiful, beautiful science."
20,,400CP,Moon Tech ,Okami,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"While you aren't granted a full understanding of everything the Moon Tribe could do, you've been blessed with the basics, including the method to make the metal used in their constructions, and an intuitive understanding of the way the machinery functions. For the most part, the inner workings are mostly a mystery, though what is known is that they can run infinitely on their power source and are controlled by the spirit or divine power of the user. Examples of the greatest of their technology includes Yami's nearly unbreakable transforming robot body, a machine that generates freezing blizzards, and spaceships. Lesser works include most non-divine creations in the item section. This talent could quickly grow into so much more if you could only get your hands on enough Moon Tribe relics to experiment with or an expert to learn from.
Indeed, this is all promised to you by Yami, along with dark power unending and rule in Nippon if only you swear fealty to him and devote yourself to his goal. After all, he has already granted you so much, and without even demanding your loyalty. As a bonus, Yami will even throw in the right to manifest his markings on your body. In appearance, they're simply a blue mirror of the celestial markings worn by Brush Gods. Try not to show it off to those few who've dealt with him before, as none will hesitate in slaying an agent of Yami. I'll leave the choice up to you."
21,,400CP,NovaTech ,Trinity:Aberrant,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Nova powers can fill technological gaps, allowing for devices to be constructed that are decades ahead of the curve...even if those devices won't work for anyone but the Nova that made them. While mainly the domain of Mega-intelligent scientists, you've made strides into the field of using technology that amplifies or is fuelled by a Nova's innate powers. Perhaps this is as simple as a gauntlet that helps focus and strengthen Quantum Bolts, or as complex as a massive structure that allows for a Warp- capable Nova to reach a distant star system with their power."
22,,400CP,There's An App For That ,UQ Holder,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Magic Apps are a recent invention, made to bring power to the people. They turn a magical spell into an electronic format that can be inserted into a Manaphone, a device to power the spells with electricity, and then freely use that magic without doing the training or energy normally needed. Amazing stuff and you're at the forefront of that new science. You're quite effortlessly able to translate any magical spell or Ki technique that you know into a Magic App, provided you have the proper facilities, regardless of how strange or powerful the magic may be. You do still need to power the spell with something once you turn it into an App but you're well versed in the creation of Manaphones and like devices too, so you can convert almost any kind of phone or computer to be able to cast apps too."
23,,600CP,DigiModify ,Digimon World Re: Digitize,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"No matter how great a creation might be; you can't plan for everything when you make it. The same goes for people; as even the most skilled warrior might run into problems such as their inability to walk on water. However, through the power of SCIENCE all things are possible!
Through acts of technological wizardry you're capable of creating special 'programs' you can 'install' in both objects and living beings to modify their abilities, or how they interact with the environment. Something like water walking would be the work of a few hours of coding; while creating a false wall would take only a few minutes.
Greater yet is the possibility of improving lifeforms. Such as finding ways to 'overclock' them for a significant but temporary boost in ability; though the strain such things may cause will require their cautious use and application. However, with patience and a dedicated subject you can study intimately it may be possible to chip away at a creatures limitations, or program new capabilities derived from their existing traits; slowly but surely improving them through incremental steps. Though take care when doing so, as the more that you push them with a single alteration the greater the risk you expose your subject to. That said, a little danger is nothing a brilliant mind like yourself is unfamiliar with."
24,,600CP,Digitized Sorcery ,Fate/Extra,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"The Magi of old had to adapt, converting the dying system of magecraft into something that could be used to their advantage within the Moon Cell. The results of their efforts are the Code Casts, a digital version of magecraft. Much like them, you can now convert magical systems into a technological variant. This will not be instant and will require a fair amount of research for you to accomplish, but it would let you find a new side to existing systems you possess."
25,,600CP,Gadgeteer ,Hellboy,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"I mean, someone's got to make all the cool gear and equipment that the BPRD uses, right? But not only are you a skilled engineer and inventor, capable of making things like Hellboy's Samaritan revolver and the garbage truck they use in the field, but you're also able to create technology that interacts with and perhaps- with time and study- even uses some of the mystical energies found in this world, such as the detectors they use for finding magical creatures and objects. In addition, designing specialty gear meant to be used by one person such as Abe Sapien's breathing apparatus or- again- Hellboy's pistol is much easier and quicker than it would normally be."
26,,600CP,Magic is the Mother of Invention ,The Magicians - TV Show,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"It seems that you've been dabbling in the art of creating Magical objects, and have found yourself to be quite proficient at it! You're now a certified genius when it comes to creating and altering Magical objects, be they regularly enchanted or MagiTech, and you have enough base knowledge to create things such as state-of-the-art Magical batteries or warded objects on par with Brakebills University's wards. You invent and create new Magical objects incredibly quickly, and can easily deduce the purpose and method of usage of any Magical object given enough time."
27,,600CP,Magical Mechanic ,Generic Buffy Fanfiction,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"By definition, anything that exists as part of the universe is natural and is therefore subject to engineering no different than physics, chemistry, or biology. Cybernetic human/demon hybrids are certainly doable, as are computers that perform location spells and summon power from a massive reactor stored in a pocket dimension. Magic's erratic nature is never beyond a mathematical equation to account for the variance, and even spells that require a living being would easily accept one of your AIs.
CAPSTONE BOOSTED: This now extends to any abilities you have. Your creations are inherently linked to you and are receptive to your powers. You may have trouble finding a way to provide enough energy to machines to let them wield your full power, but you at least have the means to imbue any ability, perk, or attribute into your creations."
28,,600CP,Magos Aetheric ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Though feared and maligned, the existence of the Imperium nonetheless depends upon exploiting the immaterium. Understanding it allows for travel, for communication, and to battle the daemonic on even terms. You have come to be one of the very few experts on the subject of the warp, and know how to manipulate it through technology. You can easily craft psy-implants that boost or suppress psychic powers, weaponry incorporating psychic components, or hexagrammatic wards. With enough time and resources you could build or even improve upon existing patterns of gellar field generators, warp drives, and immaterial sensors. You have even made inroads into understanding the genetic influence behind the manifestation of psyker, pariah and navigator abilities. This is not an easy path to tread, for the slightest misstep or moment of carelessness can see you damned, and even with the most exacting precautions it is a road fraught with peril."
29,,600CP,Mechanica ,Ars Magica,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"In medieval Europe, Heron of Alexandria was known mostly for his philosophical works, but he also produced extensive texts on mathematics, physics and mechanics, which inspired a group of mechanic-mages known as the Mechanicians. These Mechanicians created magical mechanical beings known as Mechanica, some of which even had human-level intelligence.
This knowledge spread throughout much of the Eastern Roman Empire, but died out in the fifth century as a result of religious persecution. You now have the knowledge and skill to revive this tradition, being capable of building Mechanica yourself. While these can be designed to perform simple mechanical tasks, they can also duplicate spell effects, and, with extra effort, they can be awakened, granting them magic resistance, the intelligence of an average human and a personality based on their form and materials.
For example, a mechanical snake might be deceptive and prone to telling lies, while a being made from iron may be particularly stubborn. A being awakened this way begins its life very loyal to its creator, and will likely remain that way as long as it is not mistreated. Creating Mechanica does not require vis despite the fact that they will operate indefinitely if kept safe and well-maintained. The components required for their construction are very expensive, however."
30,,600CP,Sufficient Enough ,Winger’s World,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Magic. Tech. Same thing. It's all in how you explain it. You can now take any magic, and boil it down to the point that you can reproduce it as technology. You can also take any form of technology, and make it into an easily accessible form of magic. "
31,,600CP,Neo Engineer ,Date a Live,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"For better or worse, your talents are more important at the back of the battle rather than in the frontlines. You're an engineer of either AST or directly of DEM Industries. Developing and upgrading CR-Units and weapons is your trade and life, even the most complex and dangerous of suits or weapons are something easy to do. But, perhaps your true talent is the skill of uniting mana and technology with extreme freedom, making breakthrough after breakthrough as long as you have the resources. Who knows, maybe with enough data you could create an artificial spirit."
32,,600CP,Programming Miracles ,Alterworld 2.4,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"The metaphysics of this world allow for some interesting things to happen. Creating a fully realized dimension with its own malleable laws and rules is something common place though such a thing was never intentional. The Perma Effect caused many new worlds to spring into being from the playgrounds of humanity, video games become more than their intended distractions from reality and become real in themselves all through the power of belief and the divine spark of a human soul. By buying this perk you can take a little of this divinity with you, you become an able game designer and programmer. Someone who could create entire worlds from scratch with amazing amounts of detail. People would be astounded to see the worlds you create. This on its own is amazing but that is not all, by merely getting enough people to willingly play your game in your world you can slowly split it off into its own self contained world. The numbers are not low, requiring a large amount of people to play for extended amounts of time before your world begins to go from unreal to real. A minimum of 200,000 souls all playing in your world all believing in it and wishing it was real will be your lower threshold for such a feat, that is your minimum threshold to start an unreal world down its path become a real world of its own. Surely you can pull that off, yes? You can toggle this effect if you wish to simply craft some of the best games around and not have them become miniature world of them own I guess. If you were into that."
33,,600CP,Sparking Innovation ,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Sparking Innovation (200CP) The fruits of hard work and study. By studying the arts of the ancient Sheikah, You can now create basic Ancient technology. The chief use of this is that you have the knowledge of creating the blue flame that acts as the energy source for much Sheikah Tech. This Blue Flame can be used to fuel various magitech as Sheikah devices are known to be, and in turn you are capable of creating simple tools such as cameras and recording devices with this level of knowledge. Nothing ground shaking on its own, but it's the base of even greater innovation
It Is Written (400CP) The use of mystical runes for enchanted effects is well known by those with a passing interest in the magical arts, but...the Sheikah were unique. They were able to create a language from runes that had conditional statements and effects. In short - the Sheikah could program with runes, thus allowing for programs to become spells. You have knowledge of this art as well - You are able to use Runes to code programs such as those used by the Sheikah Slate to perform its functions. This combined with Sparking Innovation would give you the groundwork to create your own variant of the Sheikah Slate with your own round of Runes...though magic doesn't make something simple - you'll need to create the code for these Slates yourself."
34,,600CP,The Science of Mysticism ,D.Y.N. Freaks,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"The wonders of human ingenuity will never cease, even in a supposedly cruel world like this. You've gained the knowledge to convert magical spells into data format and upload them into technological devices, allowing those devices to cast those spells by drawing on the power the device runs on. As they have been turned into code, you are able to also alter the way the spells work to a great extent by interacting with and altering that code. Whilst you do not have unlimited freedom with these changes, it's impossible to make the spell many times as powerful as before or take away the drawbacks entirely or turn it into an entirely different spell, you can alter many of its' mechanics and rules to better suit your purposes. Make a shield spell automatically activate in certain conditions or change an elemental spell from controlling fire into one controlling another of the basic elements such as wind or water."
35,,750CP,Vitriolic Craftsman | Demonic Bartender | Chalcanth | Purest Vitriol | Exotic Components ,Exalted - The Infernals,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Vitriolic Craftsman (400CP) The artifacts of Malfeas differ on a fundamental level from those of Creation, and as such Infernal artisans have devised many techniques to create these infernal relics. The making of such artifacts requires the pure form of the dark and acrid liquid known as vitriol, and the binding of demons into these relics, dissolving their forms and integrating their still-living Essences into their creation.
Under an infernal artisan's ministrations, pure vitriol serves as a catalyst. Objects bathed in it are seared free of weakness, making them as strong as any of Creation's magical materials; component parts flow together and intermingle, amalgamating into a unified whole. Where an artificer in Creation would spend months carving and shaping an artifact's components, his Malfean counterpart immerses them in vitriol and guides their slow, inextricable melding. Then, one slowly integrates the dissolved form of a living demon, known as Chalcanth or Azoth depending on their power, into the device's nascent structure.
A demon must be of sufficient stature to match the power of a relic in order to bond with it, and likewise must its nature also accord with the relic's function if the procedure is to succeed. Now you too will join the ranks of hell's greatest artisans, with knowledge and skill that encompasses vitriol itself, the acids and catalysts derived from it and its use in the crafting of infernal relics.
Your knowledge encompasses much understanding of demonic Essence, as well as the instinctive ability to use the appropriate mundane crafts to use together with vitriol as the catalyst. Bonding the Chalcanth to a Brass blade of your own design shall be a labor almost considered easy to an craftsman of your skill. Likewise the arts of demonic magi-technology and the creation and modification of life through vitalizing essence are known and practised by you, though their applications are somewhat more complex. As one of Hell's master artisans you may even surpass the limitations of the dull and feeble demonic essence contained within your creations, to instill them with a demonic will as a true Hellforged wonder with its own intellect and awakened essence.
Demonic Bartender (Exalted - The Infernals) (200CP) Demons love their liquor. As water is extremely rare and milk nearly unknown in the demon realm, Hell instead offers a thousand infernal wines, whiskeys, brandies, vodkas and other drinks. Many of them contain other drugs, both natural and supernatural. Some are flat-out toxic to mortals. Still, those Exalts who cultivates an immunity to poison and cast-iron gullet can explore a world of strange intoxicants that range from gut-ripping vileness to soul-shuddering delight. You've gained an understanding on how to create all these brews yourself. How to ferment bone-wine, thanachvil, and gurshant. How to distill liquid emotions and waking dreams derived from Hegra's rains into elixirs. How to bottle the perfect pleasure that is sypax, or the liquid Lethe of final rest elixir... and finally, even the most precious drink in all of Malfeas, chalcanth. chalcanth is the liquefied, distilled essence of a demon. The unfortunate demon is dissolved in pure vitriol while still alive, so that drinking chalcanth is like tasting pure Being to a demon, and grants both Essence and memories to any who drink it. Of course if you'd prefer, it could also be used in forging infernal relics, by far the most common artifacts in hell.
Chalcanth (50CP) The life force of a demon preserved in vitriol, chalcanth appears as a cupful of vibrant liquid. The color and consistency of any given dose varies with its origin, but the fluid always stirs restlessly of its own accord and issues a faint susurrus, as the demon liquified in its creation still lives. Chalcanth's primary purpose is the creation of infernal relics, but that is not its only use. Many in Malfeas seek it out as an intoxicating source of essence, because if one drinks it they will be energized as the flavors of the demon's mind and soul tumble through the drinker's brain in a synesthetic wash of images and emotions. With one purchase of this, you will gain a cupful of high quality Chalcanth once every five days.
Purest Vitriol (50CP) Passive and reactive in nature, Vitriol was designed by the Primordials to catalyze evolutionary transformation in matter and Essence. But in the millennia since the Primordial War, the Yozis' loathing for their jailers, their captivity, and their own broken natures has permeated the very nature of vitriol, infusing it with their hate. Now, it consumes all that it encounters. The stuff bubbles in open pits laden with the detritus of all that it has dissolved, and these impurities must be removed before the vitriol may be used for magical purposes. With one purchase of this, you will gain a weekly supply of enough pure Vitriol to dissolve a demon in or baptise one relic smaller than a vehicle.
Exotic Components (50CP) Artificers of hell construct their relics with a greater pool of exotic reagents than those of Creation-made artifacts, for the world-bodies of the Yozi are rich with alien metals, stones and woods, not to mention the tissues and excretions of countless species of lesser demons, animals, plants and other entities that mortal savants might not even recognize as life. Of course, while these many be easy to come across in hell itself, not all Infernals have the luxury of staying there whenever they work on their relics. So with one purchase of this, you will gain a starting wealth of exotic components and an additional weekly supply of more than enough to construct a lesser relic, straight from the Demon Realm."
36,,800CP,Computation Creation | Magical Science ,Youjo Senki - Saga of Tanya the Evil,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Computation Creation (400CP) The operation orb - or computation orb, if you prefer - is a masterwork of science and mathematics. A unique crystalline and clockwork structure allows for mathematical code to be stored - called spells - and channels energy from the user in order to empower them. You now understand not just how they work, but why - and in doing so, can apply the principles to other aims. Magic is currently used solely by the air corps for long range bombardment. Let's fix that, shall we?
Magical Science (400CP) You are the forefront of mage technology, and can easily improve on what is currently being used, with some effort you can also build far more powerful mage tech. Whatever faction you belong to is sure to value you greatly."
37,,1100CP,Thing of Wonder | Foaly? Koboi? Jumper ,Artemis Fowl,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Thing of Wonder (500CP) You're brilliant. That's just the best way to say it. You are simply an incredibly, unbelievably clever person. Your memory is a thing of wonder, with unlimited storage, perfect indexing and recall. You have a perfect sense of time and schedules, being able to keep perfect track of any number of things at all times. Your brain and nervous system is such that your thoughts can travel ridiculously, mind-bogglingly fast, giving you a peerless speed of processing info. You can control this, to prevent going nuts from boredom if nothing else. Not that you would, your patience is inexhaustible and infinite, though your reflexes remain sharp through any length of time. You can focus on any number of things at once, working at all of them as if you were working on that thing alone. Your analysis and comprehension skills are similarly ridiculous, being practically miraculous. Patterns and puzzles unravel in front of you, revealing their secrets almost as if they want to, to you. You can analyze legal cases, codes, riddles and puzzles, conspiracies and schemes, and break them in less time than it takes most people to figure out what is happening at all. There is no code you can't break, no pattern you can't identify. This perk is a Capstone Booster, meaning it enhances each of the origin capstones if taken with this. The details are mentioned in the perk descriptions.
Foaly Koboi Jumper (600CP) You're a genius among geniuses, in technology and magic both. Your technological skill is such that you find it child's play to create gadgets and weapons like Bio-Bombs, or the technological wonders that are LEP uniforms, or small devices that make toy cars nuclear-powered. You can even improve them or come up with more tech of similar levels, if not even more advanced. You're also a hacker of absolutely unmatched skill, capable of slicing through any and all systems, firewalls and defenses like a knife through butter, bending networks and websites to your will, and all the rest that comes with it. It doesn't matter how advanced or sophisticated it is, if it's electronic or digital and it can be accessed at all, you can penetrate all aspects of it until you control it outright - it's just a matter of time and effort. And very little of either, really. Your skills at magic are nothing less, either. Well, if you can do it at all. If you can, then your talent is nothing short of legendary, allowing you to master spells and rituals that would take other a lifetime in days, if not less. Your skills are distributed equally in all fields of magic, so much so that any advancement in one area automatically improves the others too. You could do things like study necromancy for a month and come out tossing lightning bolts like a pro.
Capstone Boost Both your scientific and magical abilities get a massive boost, advancing you several times over in both fields. In addition, they work together now, making you an expert in making technology that mimics magic and vice-versa. You know how to create both technology and magic to do anything and everything you yourself are capable of doing. Spells to replace devices, vice-versa, and products that use both, that is, techno-magic. You're also capable of reverse engineering any and all magic and technology you encounter, now. No matter how advanced the tech or how obscure the magic, how powerful and complicated they may be, all you need is one look at any magic or technology to know the underlying principles under it, and how to recreate, modify and improve it in a hundred different ways."
38,,1200CP,Mega Bomb | Guru ,Chrono Trigger,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Mega Bomb (600CP) Magic and Technology are both capable of some pretty fantastic things. So why not put them together, and see what happens? You now understand the secret to integrating magic seamlessly into your mechanical devices, enabling you to create devices like bombs powered with fire magic or medkits that use healing magic. While initially your devices will be one-shots that rely on a magical charge you have to deliver, in time, you'll learn how to make much more advanced fusions, such machines that run on magical power sources, or automated spellcasting devices. In the end, the only limit is your skill with machinery and magic.
Guru (600CP) Back in the glory days of Zeal, Guru was a title reserved only for the most skilled and knowledgeable of their mages and scientists. You might not be there yet, but when I'm done with you, you'll be well on your way to deserving the title. Magic is akin to a science to you, letting you delve into the secrets of sorcery the same way a physicist would unlock the secrets of the atom. This also includes learning how to apply magical knowledge like an engineer does the sciences, letting you come up with breathtaking magical wonders. The Blackbird, the Mammon Machine, the Ocean Palace - who knows what you'll add to that list of legends."
39,,1300CP,Device Meister | Mysterious Serum | Ancient Knowledge ,Lyrical Nanoha,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Device Meister (600CP) This is the real treasure of the TSAB's technological capabilities - mixing the use of magic and technology inorder to create Devices that can channel the energy outwards. You have a complete knowledge of how to build and maintain Devices, along with how to program AI for said Devices to use.
While you can construct most Devices and similar items presented here, the ability to make Unison Devices isn't included here - you'll have to learn that one on your own, and many have tried and failed to do so in the past. You could, with some experimentation, combine different magical systems into Devices together, especially with the help of 'SimilarPrinciples' to streamline the process...it will take some trial and error, but you could apply these principles and Devices to other systems if you work at it enough.
Mysterious Serum (300CP) Fascinating. These test tubes contain a colorless serum that, when ingested, allow one to 'awaken' the Linker Cores of sentient beings, allowing them to naturally use this world's magic after a little bit of training with it. Note that individuals like Nanoha are exceptions to the rule, and will be in future worlds as well - unless they had a particular affinity for magic or some way to boost their arcane power, you're unlikely to find anyone who starts with a Natural Ability higher than A. You receive eight of these, along with the formula on how to create more - though it's encoded and you'll have to decipher it. If you have 'Ancient Knowledge', you already know how to make more on your own from the get-go. Magical ability growth for individuals outside of this world tend to plateau at S-rank on their own. Bear that in mind.
Ancient Knowledge (400CP) The legacy of the Belkan Empire exists not merely within ruins or Lost Logia, but in the blood of its people. You have inherited a bloodline of note, and while it may or may not be one of the canonical or major bloodlines, a piece of it has followed you in your very DNA, subconsciously nudging at your memory. While this creates no stress or strain on your personality, the connection is diluted enough that you can't consciously access this memory...but when you come into contact with Lost Logia, you will rapidly gain insight into how it functions and possibly ways to engineer it once again. You will need actual technical skills to pull this off, but with a little bit of time, perhaps you can restore what is lost? Post-jump, this same insight applies to 'lost' or 'forgotten' technology, though you will likely need other sources of knowledge and abilities to truly restore it, depending on its complexity. May or may not come with brief instances of acting and speaking like a resident of the Belkan Empire at random intervals."
40,,1400CP,Magical Coding | Coding Station | Spell Compendium | CAD Tuning | Taurus Silver ,The Irregular At The Magic Highschool,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"Magical Coding (100CP) The Activation Sequences used to enact Modern magic are made up of large blocks of code translated into Magic Sequences by the Magician's Magic Calculation Area. You know the basics of this world's coding methods, allowing you to program simple Activation Sequences into a CAD and create simple hacking programs.
Coding Station (200CP) This is the workhorse of a Magic Engineer, being their main 'battle station' so to speak. This large desk comes equipped with an integrated computer and CAD connection system to code Sequences into CADs and tune them to their user. It also possesses a simple VI system to make coding easier and more efficient. Includes a CAD can take almost any form you want, from a bracelet to a pendant to a stick, and store up to 99 different Activation Sequences though it's usually less precise than a specialized CAD.
Spell Compendium (100CP) This small PDA-like device contains a large selection of Activation and Magic Sequences for your personal use. Secret or unique Sequences cannot be included in this selection.
CAD Tuning (400CP) Tuning a CAD to the specifics of its owner's Psion wave profile enables it to function at peak efficiency, reducing Psion waste and improving connectivity. You can do the same for most artifacts you own, calibrating them to improve their connections to you, slightly boosting their power and efficiency.
Taurus Silver (600CP) Taurus Silver is a noun collectively used by two different people, Tatsuya Shiba and Ushiyama, and is the head of the Third Division of Four Leaves Technology, with Tatsuya handling the software side and Ushiyama the hardware side. You are now of the same caliber as them, being either a very effective professional code-builder or engineer, capable of assembling new forms of codes or creating new types of machines capable of grand things when brought together, like Tatsuya's Loop Cast System or Ushiyama's Silver Series CADs. If taken with Strategic-Class Magician, you can have both specialties at higher levels than even Tatsuya of Ushiyama, and you also gain a powerful affinity for magitech of all forms."
41,,1450CP,MineFactory Reloaded | Industrialcraft | Buildcraft | Railcraft | Lore of Alex | Nethereye ,Minecraft,Domain: Skills: Magitech,"MineFactory Reloaded (600CP) Your understanding of magic is complete. To you, magic is engineering, and can be automated and reproduced on an Industrial scale... at a considerable cost in life, as this sort of magitech runs not merely on Electricity, but also on the life Essence extracted from the bodies of the dying. This liquid Essence permits the manufacture of potions and enchanted items on an automated assembly line, or the breakdown of enchanted items into Essence and component materials. This can even extend to potions and enchanted items from other universes, provided you have mastered the relevant techniques, and have enough of the required raw materials to make automation worthwhile.
IndustrialCraft (400CP) Working your way up from simple machines, you are able to build a vast array of advanced machinery, from the humble ore grinding Macerator, to the futuristic Mass Fabricator. In time, you'll be able to build automated factory complexes, supply all your power needs with nuclear energy, protect yourself with nigh impervious Quantum Armour, teleport between bases with ease, and terraform vast areas to suit your whims.
Buildcraft (200CP) You aren't limited to building things yourself given some basic supplies and some redstone, you can use a system of gears and tubes to automate your crafting tables, create an item sorting system, and build massive automated quarries capable of stripping the land of all resources down to the bedrock. It'll take a bit to get started, but once you're up and running, you'll be sure to have all the resources you need.
Railcraft (100CP) Instead of the crude minecart tracks you were able to make before, you are now able to make properly sturdy rails, able to bear the weight of full Steampowered trains that can pull a variety of useful carts. Using a system of tracks and automatic loader/unloaders, you can automate the delivery of resources and liquids from one place to another, or deploy 'railgun' systems to launch explosive filled carts at your enemies! You can even create trains which automatically build their own tracks, or which dig tunnels for you. You'll also be able to make massive steam boilers, with which you can power your Buildcraft devices far more efficiently... given a nontrivial setup process.
Lore of Alex (100) You know the mystic secrets of this world, and can easily assemble a portal to the Nether, given a supply of Obsidian. Should you acquire the necessary hellish reagents there, you'll be able to brew a number of useful magical potions. Additionally, whenever you kill something, glowing orbs will emerge from the corpse, which will float towards you if you are close enough with enough of these (and a diamond studded Enchanting Table), you'll be able to enchant items with a variety of simple magical powers. It is notable that all these effects work generally in this world, and anyone can learn them here you just know it all from the start, and will be able to apply these effects with confidence in other worlds, or to things not normally found in this world. For instance, you'll be able to judge the enchantment capacity of arbitrary items with a glance, and that amount will be greater for you than it might be for other magi.
Nether Eye (50) You'll be able to craft Nether Eyes from Ender Pearls and Magma Cream, which will allow you to easily locate Nether Fortresses, when you visit the Nether. You'll also have a pretty solid grasp of Overworld/Nether geometry, thus allowing you to 'safely' use Nether Portals as 'shortcuts' between distant parts of the overworld. Additionally, Nether Portals will work in nonMinecraft worlds, guaranteeing you access to Nether only resources like Glowstone and Nether Wart. Caution: use of Nether Portals in universes which contain actual hell dimensions may send you there instead.
* Buildcraft, Industrialcraft and lore of alex are all required to make minefactory reloaded work. Railcraft and nethereye could be removed if wanted. This would save 150CP. They are add ons to buildcraft and lore of alex"
