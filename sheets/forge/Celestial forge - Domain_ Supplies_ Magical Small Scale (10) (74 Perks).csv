1,,50CP,Golden Coin Pouch ,Overlord - The Series,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You've got access to a money pouch filled with a 'respectable' amount of gold coins. Respectable by the standards of a max level Yggdrasil Player at least. This amount of gold is enough to beggar the imagination of commoners and even landed nobility will consider it a ruinously large sum, easily into the tens of thousands. If you're a Player it's minted with YGGDRASIL iconography and is probably what you had in your inventory when you arrived in the New World, they're sure to attract attention if you use them. If you're a local it's in local denominations, and god knows how you came across it. For 50 CP you have ten times as much gold, and you'll find that every month any gold you've spent or expended has been replaced within the pouch. The pouch itself can hold any number of gold coins, but only gold coins, inside of it.
One notable fact regarding these coins, and indeed Yggdrasil Gold Coins in general, is that they can substitute for many types of incidental materials or reagents when it comes to creating magical items or artifacts. For example as long as you have a scroll to work with the gold could substitute for inks to allow you to make a magic scroll, or special oils or unguents in a bit of clockwork, and so on and so forth. Hell, you can even use the stuff to garnish food and drink at no risk to the consumer. Basically, so long as you've got the main pieces for making something you can substitute in some Yggdrasil Gold for any of the incidental bits required in the process."
2,,50CP,Gems ,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Magic crystals that somehow improve your abilities, though not all that much until you start stacking a great deal of them. Every purchase gives you one hundred and fifty amethysts (which improve your graze rewards), thirty aquamarines (which improve the rate at which your MP recovers), fifteen topazes (which improves your special ability recovery rate), eight rubies (which improve your defence), seven sapphires (which improves your attack power), five emeralds (which helps your health to recover), and one diamond (which improves both attack and defence, twice as much as rubies and sapphires do). 
Additionally, they can be used to power monsters and traps, with more powerful ones requiring higher quality gems, if you know how to use them."
3,,50CP,Mamono Realm Ink ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A collection of inks made from minerals in various demon realms, with varying magic properties. These enchantments can range from protecting the words from physical wear to preventing anyone from tampering with the letter to even charms that send the words and feelings of the message straight into the reader’s head, eroding and charming the reader’s heart with passionate desire. However, the magical effect contained in this ink will not manifest in an insincere nonsense sentence, and you also cannot make someone believe in a lie."
4,,50CP,Stabilized Moonsilver ,Exalted - The Lunars,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Deposits of Moonsilver form only in the Wyld. Beams of moonlight unpredictably illuminate a region of the Bordermarches or Middlemarches, boiling off the Wyld and distilling its Essence into the fluid, watery-looking moonsilver. However, raw moonsilver is unstable. An artisan needs special techniques to work it. Through coaxing songs and careful taps and strokes with crystal hammers and probes, the artisan quiets the Wyldness remaining in the raw moonsilver so it becomes a stable metal. Pacify it too much and it freezes into silver; hit it too hard, and it shatters into drops of quicksilver.
This does mean that in other worlds, you might have some difficulty finding any quantities of Moonsilver to use. Therefore, you may purchase a supply of moonsilver here. Gaining five Talents of pure, stabilized Moonsilver for you to use, enough for the creation of most any kind of artifact, as well as notes detailing the thaumaturgical procedure that may be used to create Moonsilver yourself. In the future, you will gain another five Talents of this mutable metal every year, ensuring that you will never permanently run 
out."
5,,100CP,Chaos Meats and Wine,Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"This collection of food and wine is special in that it's made from extraordinary ingredients. Whether the meat of a Chaos Dragon, eggs from a Divine Phoenix, wine made from grapes that grew on a Chaos Star, etc.. No matter how strong you are, you can choose to be affected by the extra nourishment the wine and food grants such as allowing you to refill your energies, getting you very drunk, or calming you down. The effects of this food on Mortals and other weak creatures could increase their lifespan by thousands of years. You can summon this food and drink anywhere with no limit on the amount alongside dishes, and can choose the general effects of each dish. The stronger you are the greater the ingredients, and the greater their effects.
* These are high tier cultivation foods with cultivation pill like effects."
6,,100CP,Building Blocks ,Paper Mario,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A collection of mushroom kingdom brick blocks, yellow blocks, stone blocks, metal blocks, and empty ? blocks that can be filled with whatever you wish. You receive a large stockpile of each, and they replenish once a month. Feel free to use them however you wish."
7,,100CP,Dye and Paint ,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A selection of paints and dyes that can be used to color various objects or furniture. Each hue has enough to paint two or three objects, and restocks in a day once used. This also comes with a set of brushes, rollers, and scrapers that you can use to apply or remove the dyes and paints. To start with, you have all of the basic, bright, deep, and gradient hues. You gain the strange, lunar, shadow, negative, and illuminant hues."
8,,100CP,Elemental Seeds ,World Seed,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"An elemental seed is the condensed essence of an element, and they're almost exclusively produced by Druids or Mages capable of creating enchantments replicating their methods. They have various uses, such as powering enchantments or magical items, and are required in the process of giving an object an elemental ability. Druids also use them to introduce new elements into their Grove, and need them to cultivate their affinities past the 25% point. As such, each of them is fairly valuable, with the price skyrocketing once you go beyond the basic seven elements and to incredibly rare ones such as Time.
They are also pretty time intensive to make, requiring about an hour of work for each, even for people relatively skilled in their creation. But now, you won't ever have to worry about that, as you'll get a dozen Seeds for each of your affinities delivered either to your warehouse or another place you designate, every week. Their quality depends on the level of your affinities: from 5% to 25% you'll get low-grade ones, from 25% to 50% medium-grade ones, from 50% to 75% high-grade ones, and finally, from 75% up to 100% you'll get top-grade seeds."
9,,100CP,Endless Bag of Glowstone,Minecraft,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You get a small bag which inexplicably contains a full stack of Glowstone Dust. It refills once a week. Handy for lighting up your surroundings, keeping the monsters at bay."
10,,100CP,Endless Bag of Redstone ,Minecraft,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,You get a small bag which inexplicably contains a full stack of Redstone. It refills once a week. Handy for experiments with Redstone Wiring.
11,,100CP,Honkai Cubes ,Honkai Impact Third,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You have a supply of Honkai Cubes and know how to make more. Crystallized Honkai energy that when used to make or enhance weapons, gear, or anything really far enhances it beyond normal limits of human capabilities. Of course just having them does nothing, and if you just slap it on a low quality weapon it wont go very far. But with proper application of skill and infusion you can use these to create incredible things. Just beware potential feedback. Not intended to be fed to Tunas."
12,,100CP,Magical Ore ,Everyone Else is a Returnee,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"What is a smith without some metal to work with? Equipment plays a large part in this world, and a craftsman can only do so much without good materials. Luckily you happen to have a large storage box filled with lumps of unrefined ores of many varieties. The rarity and valuability of these ores range from normal iron all the way to precious ores of heaven, with the quantity of the ores being inversely proportional to their value. As you travel to future jumps, this box will update to include for the various ores you encounter. I hope you have some way of refining and forging them. Each month, the box will refill."
13,,100CP,Monster Hunted ,Everyone Else is a Returnee,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Metal and stone are only a small group of materials used in the creation of equipment. Much more prevalent is the use of the flesh of monsters. From the feathers to the fur to the blood of them, every part of a monster can be used for something by a skilled craftsman. Luckily you just so happen to have a replenishing supply of monster bits. You can choose the class of monster flesh you receive, though the stronger the material the less of it will be supplied.
You may only get a handful of 5th class feathers, while you could get a metric ton of 1st class scales. New material is supplied each month. Among these you may even get some magic cores."
14,,100CP,Pixie Dust ,Peter Pan,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Most if not all fairies constantly produce the magical substance of fairy dust around their body, such that a trail follows wherever you fly. People and even objects as large as ships, when covered in the sparkling dust, gain the ability to fly. However, while inanimate things can fly without any challenge, people wishing to fly must have sincere faith and happy, carefree emotions. You can constantly emit pixie dust at will and even surround you with a cloud of fairy dust. The perk also enables you to breathe easily without choking on pixie dust or other particles, such that you could breathe and talk even with smoke all around you. If you are not a fairy, you will be looked at quite strangely by others, but things are often strange in Neverland so that's hardly a bad thing."
15,,100CP,Raw Materials ,Elder Scrolls Online,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"About 20 ingots worth of dwemer metal, a few honing stones, and a set of hammers and tongs. Used materials refill once a year. Not exactly powerful in the more high-tech settings, but being able to craft items out of a metal that never really rusts is something that won't ever go out of style. Or you could always just sell it off. This is almost 600 crowns worth of eternally respawning refined metal and smithing equipment just sitting on the ground after all."
16,,100CP,Sack of the Maker ,Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyo,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Medium sized, this bag contains an assortment of random ores and metals for you to work with, from cheap iron to Tauru ore which is one of the hardest known ores around, the quality and quantity of these materials will vary from day to day and sometime will drop some really precious minerals. It refills once a day so don't get shy at using them."
17,,100CP,Snifit ,Paper Mario,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Snifits are special shy guys who have specially modified masks that allow them to fire projectiles made from nightmares. These bullets can be fired one at a time or in a barrage of three, and yes they are made of nightmares. I guess that means if you had a method of storing nightmares you could use them to create stronger projectiles or ones with special properties. Channeling nightmares into bullets requires the expenditure of flower [magic] points."
18,,100CP,Soul Gems ,Elder Scrolls Online,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"An essential tool for enchanters and mages, yet one that's only recently gained formal recognition. You have five Petty, four Common and Lesser, three Greater and Grand, and two Black soul gems all held in a tasteful keshweed fiber satchel. Each gem holds a soul of its corresponding size, color, and power. For example, a Petty gem would hold a rabbit or a small dog at most, while a Grand would hold a mammoth or a strong Daedra. These are both White souls and can be held in White gems. The rarer Black soul gems hold the souls of sapient creatures, like humans, beast folk, or elves. You can use them as arcane batteries, as focuses for spells, or just as general magic storage. You'll get a new set every month of whatever's been depleted. Remember to be careful handling the Black gems, as they can have unfortunate and potentially lethal side-effects if not contained properly."
19,,100CP,Story Water Extractor ,Haroun and the Sea of Stories,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"All of Kahani rests on an ocean made of stories, and every Guppee uses it for one thing or another. Truly, it is the spiritual source of life in all the worlds, from which dreams, ideas, and words are granted life. Aside from granting stories and dreams to drinkers, the water has many magical uses, depending on how creatively you use the resource. This perk gives you in-depth knowledge on how to draw out and use story water from the plentiful Streams of Story. Furthermore, in later worlds you now have the ability to find and extract story water, which will always be somewhere one way or another (but without the perk, it will be impossible to find this metaphysical sea unless an equivalent already canonically exists). There are countless uses for the liquid, so feel free to experiment as you please. Just keep in mind that the state and availability of story water, just like the treatment of stories themselves, varies between worlds; be careful that you don't drink polluted water, or your dreams might take a turn for the worse. On the other hand, story water from certain magical worlds, particularly those built on stories, may be exceptionally potent."
20,,150CP,Portable Examination Station ,Van Helsing,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A portable study centre - magnifying glass, vials, all held within a tightly-locked briefcase. As well, comes with a variety of supernatural samples - from vials of different blood types of demons and werewolves, to vampire fangs, demonic horn shavings, ghoul teeth, and ectoplasm from a great variety of undead."
21,,200CP,Adamantium ,X-Men Evolution,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You receive a case of liquid adamantium which is the hardest material in this world. This nigh-indestructible metal once solidified in anything won't be melted and is practically impossible to destroy. 
You contain more than enough to do something like Weapon X and still have plenty left over. You'll of course receive more adamantium whenever you run out."
22,,200CP,Asarakam and Yoma Samples ,Claymore,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"This is an unending supply of samples from both awakened, and unawakened Asarakam, by combining them together you can create another form of parasitic life that can infect humans turning them into Yoma. This supply also includes yoma flesh and blood, just because you might not want to bother with the other steps."
23,,200CP,Beauty Leads To Death ,Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 1,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Ah, what a pure soul you are. Untainted, shining with a gentle light like morning snowflakes refracting the ephemeral rays of the rising sun. To corrupt it and bring you to the depths of vileness would be such a pleasure ahem. This pure soul of yours, besides looking rather pretty to anyone with the appropriate senses, makes you a rather fitting sacrifice. Even just a mouthful of blood taken from you as payment could have effects similar to an entire life's taking and that's assuming you don't have any special traits that might raise your value. Still, that type of thing could get you killed easily, so you've figured out how to hide or negate all of these traits as a necessity for survival."
24,,200CP,Bottomless Bucket ,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A fairly large metal bucket, which, when filled with a liquid, can pour out infinite amounts of said liquid unless deliberately completely emptied. It will resist cold, heat, corrosion, and other damaging properties of whatever liquid fills it, and when deliberately emptied, no traces or cross-contamination will happen when the bucket is refilled."
25,,200CP,Burgeoning Whirlflame ,Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"The flame in your heart gives you strength, but you are not the only one who can draw upon this potence. You are magical. Even a pound of your body would function as a reagent of reasonable quality, and that's assuming whoever was using pieces of you didn't bother playing to your strengths. As a Laval, you would be a source of high quality materials for any mages wishing to produces potions or equipment aspected to fire. Given the changes to your nature, and the powers you might wield, through acquisitions in other worlds well, you'd certainly be a prized catch. Who knows what someone willing to kill the golden goose by using you in your entirety could achieve? Ah, in case you're worried: you can freely control this new feature of yours, and decide who can benefit from it and how. Without your consent, none can even learn you hold this hidden power."
26,,200CP,Canteen of Magical Supply ,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A seemingly-empty canteen that readily produces water whenever mana is applied to the canteen to power it up. The canteen normally produces normal water, but extensive exposure to specific kinds of energy can cause the water to be infused with that energy; however, your canteen (unlike most others available in-setting) has a remarkable filter, so the canteen will not become permanently locked on a specific energy or permanently tainted by one unless you want it so – instead, once the corruptive energy is gone, it will go back to producing regular, untainted water."
27,,200CP,"Charms, Talismans and Sutras ",The Irregular At The Magic Highschool,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"This is a supply of ingredients for Ancient Magic, including prepared spell cards, spirit charms and various talismans. They replenish each day after being used."

29,,200CP,Crate of adamantine ,Dungeon Keeper Ami,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Adamantine, the rare metal forged by the dwarves of the frozen north. This metal is the result of a dreadful battle between the gods of light and the gods of darkness, this metal is all that remains of a once mighty god of light that fell to earth while killing a dark god, after many years his flesh was changed and warped till it became the metal adamantine, nearly impossible to forge without the correct knowledge this metal is nearly indestructible and harms creatures of evil like fire while blocking dark magic completely. You now have a crate of this amazing metal and shall receive a new crate once a year. 
Though this may not seem like much especially with the requirements on forging it, you need not worry. This Adamantine will work as if it were normal steel up until its first forging after which its normal"
30,,200CP,Crystal Concepts ,Kingdom Hearts,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You possess the unusual ability to find tangible concepts, often used in this setting to create items through Synthesis. Nothingness, evil, darkness, light, sadness etc. You can now find distilled physical versions of normally abstract concepts left behind by defeated enemies, or hidden in obscure and hard to reach places. These concepts are typically related to the place or enemies you obtain the from, such as fiery enemies or locales holding Fire Shards, or a lightning dragon dropping a Lightning Crystal. The quality of the item depends on the difficulty of obtaining it, ranging from Shards from weak enemies, up to Stone, Gem, and finally Crystal for the progressively tougher enemies. What you do with them is up to you; they'd make nice jewellery, that's true, but I'm sure you can find a better use for crystallised fire or hope. In jump this means you find significantly more Synthesis ingredients you can either use, or sell."
31,,200CP,Delirium,Ravenwood,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Raw skill, talent, or ability, with a touch of madness. You possess the ability to collect Delirium, a raw form of drug-like ki formed from madness and chaos. The battlefield is rife with this chaotic energy. 
Using delirium, it is possible to push a skill to insane levels, and allowing for surprising uses of your abilities."
32,,200CP,Endless bag of nether warts ,Minecraft,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You get a small bag which inexplicably contains a full stack of Nether Wart. It refills once a week. The crucial ingredient in all Minecraft potions, brew it with water and any of a vast array of ingredients to create a magical potion. Also comes with a Brewing Stand."
33,,200CP,Grathmeld Supplies ,Ar Tonelico,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You receive a 1m white ceramic cube, which contains 250 kilograms of randomised base components and Grathnode crystals. Stocks replenish every week, and ratios skew towards whatever ingredients you used the most of."
34,,200CP,Iron Rose ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You gain a rose bush made of living iron. If placed in contact with a pure sample of any metal, it will generate buds and eventually roses of that metal. Such roses can be harvested, then planted to transform more and more of that metal into living metal slowly over time. They must be planted in soil rich in that metal, or in a pot full of clay and chunks of said metal to grow properly. Should you tend these roses long enough for them to bear seeds, the plants that grow from these seeds will transform base metals into whatever metal they grew from."
35,,200CP,Magic MetaMaterials ,With this Ring,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"We hear about swords and armor made of Orihalcum, Mithril, and Jovium, but there are far better uses for these wondrous materials. Jovium is a perfect conductor of heat and electricity, Orihalcum and Mithril hold a magical charge and enchantment far more effectively than ordinary materials, and both are far stronger than their weight would suggest for metals. You receive a metric ton of these three metals for use in any military or industrial project you like, and instructions for producing more. The process, however, of synthesizing common alloys into magical metamaterials requires either a familiarity with metal typically found in journeyman level craftsmen who shape metal such as blacksmiths, welders, and jewelers, or familiarity with arcane practices found in journeyman level enchanters or artificers."
36,,200CP,Monster Killing Metals,Percy Jackson And The Olympians,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"About ten pounds of Celestial Bronze, Imperial Gold or Stygian Iron. All made to destroy godly and
monstrous creatures (save the last, which also hurts mortals) weapons crafted from these materials are
incredibly durable and able to hold enchantments of the like seen in ancient myth. Your supply restocks
every two weeks, with the type of metal delivers being of your choice."
37,,200CP,Noh Mask,Golden Sky Stories,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A set of masks depicting people of different ages, Kabuki actors commonly switch between these masks
to depict themselves as different characters during a play. In such a fashion, a single actor may become
multiple people, though this is really more of a testament to the actor’s skill. When worn these masks
will make others believe you are the individual depicted in the mask. This swap occurs seamlessly even if
you put the mask on in front of people, but be wary that individuals with paranormal capabilities may be
able to see through it.
You may customize these masks accordingly, but be wary that the masks can be rather sensitive, so it is
best that you leave it to an artist to make a proper modification – or it could lead to some rather peculiar
situations if your artistic capacity happens to be...sub-par."
38,,200CP,Onmyo Supplies,Fate/Legends - Land Of The Rising Sun,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A woven pack containing a large number of normally expensive supplies needed for proper Onmyouji
craft. A seemingly unlimited amount of high quality paper, ink and scribing tools are within as a start, the
basics needed for most spells in this field. Beyond these, are a large number of premade charms and
shikigami that can be released from the pack on command. These can serve as emergency wards, alarms
and shields when in a bind. Moderately powerful on their own, they can hold off a demon or band of
men for a few minutes while you escape. The shikigami, numbering a few dozen in small paper forms,
are able to act as capable spies and messengers over long ranges. When combined into one, they turn
into a large animal such as a tiger or wyvern, a powerful combatant that can defend you against even a
decently powerful hero for a few minutes before crumbling. The charms and shikigami replenish a week
after being used."
39,,200CP,Ore Merchant,Dark Souls 2,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You have just gained the partnership of a travelling merchant, one who has an inventory that you're sure
to find interesting. This travelling merchant sells a bizarrely large quantity of exotic stones with you
getting a special discount. You always seem to be able to find them when you look hard enough, though
never in the direct line of danger. While their inventory is always bizarrely large, you can still buy them
out if you have the currency to back it up, whatever that may be locally. If you do, they'll disappear for a
while to restock. In future worlds they will continue to sell the various stones and ores of this world such
as Titanite or Boltstone, but will also temporarily stock themselves with whatever earthen curiosities can
be found in the world around them. Limited time offers! They're practically giving this stuff away!"
40,,200CP,Philosophers Stone,I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused the Apocalypse,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"One of alchemy's greatest secrets and goals. Can be used as a core to create homunculi, make special
alchemical compounds or even cure for any and all diseases. The philosopher's stone is one and yet all.
All and yet one. A single philosopher's stone can serve any function, but it cannot be separated from its
purpose, so you can't separate it or use it for multiple things at once."
41,,200CP,Sacks of Essences,Divinity - Original Sin,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"These five head sized burlap sacks are extremely light despite the fact they look to be filled to bursting
and each emits a faint light from the seams, a different color coming from each. A fiery red, a gentle
blue, a brilliant white, a somber brown, and... is that fifth one emitting shadows? Small balls of solidified
elemental essences are not a rare commodity in Rivellon and have a huge variety of uses in everything
from specialized grenades to magical arrow heads to even aiding in enchanting arms and armor. Each
sack contains five balls of each element and the sacks refill themselves every week. What use you put
these concentrated bits of elemental magic is limited only by your imagination and experimentation. Just
don't get opposing elements too close to each other. The result is fairly explosive, doubly so if you are
enchanting at the time."
42,,200CP,Soft Stick,World Seed,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"One of the technological staples in Neolife, these special devices are basically CDs for magic. Each Soft
Stick is capable of holding a single program that can be erased or replaced as needed. Once a program is
uploaded, the aura of the Soft Stick will shift to match it, making it an easy matter to convert any
software you might write into a magical formation or enchantment with the same effect, and even doing
things such as transferring an AI to an enchantment wouldn't be much trouble. Furthermore, since the
companion bracelet is a suitable terminal to upload software to and from, you wouldn't even need any
other equipment. With this purchase, you gain an endless supply of these useful little things, working
with any code or software you might write, no matter how obscure or complicated."
43,,200CP,Songstone Composer,Ar Tonelico,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Another 1m cube. This produces the essential elements of Song Science, in the form of 1 ton each week
of Songstone rubble, a crystalline ore of Parameno, Grathnode and Ardel. By itself, Songstone converts
sound into magic, storing it until a threshold is reached and it explodes in a burst of wild energy - making
them effective improvised grenades. Extracted and refined, their true potential can be reached.
Parameno absorbs sound as magic, Grathnode emits it as magic, and Ardel acts as a semiconductor."
44,,200CP,Sticker Album,Paper Mario,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"This book resembles the ones used by stamp collectors across the multiverse. This one is full of all kinds
of stickers from the sticker comet. The stickers within can be pulled out with ease and used with the
paperize technique to generate all kinds of effects. Its pages refill weekly, but the stickers within are
always random. Sometimes you may only have weak stickers, whereas other times you will have plenty
of the more powerful kinds. Unique stickers, such as the royal stickers, will not be generated by this
album but can be stored within."
45,,200CP,Vibranium Sample,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Vibranium is an extremely rare element that possesses unique attributes. In a pure mass, vibranium
forms a solid metal that is stronger than steel, but only a third of the weight, as well as being completely
vibration absorbent. This means it can absorb the impacts of a great deal of attacks, but bear in mind
high-energy attacks WILL do damage... especially if it is consistent. Purchasing this gets you a container a
foot in length with some Wakandan Vibranium shards that will replenish itself every month."
46,,200CP,Woden's Blood,Uber,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"An unrefined sample of the world shaking substance used to catalyze the transformation from normal
human to superhuman weapon, containing eight portions. Each portion can, with proper knowledge and
technology, be refined to be used as any one unit of catalyst of the basic activation sequences.
Alternatively the entire eight portions can be refined for use in one of the Special Activations.
Replenishes once per month. Acts as a highly lethal contact poison to any person without the potential
to receive Activations. Using an unrefined portion of Woden's Blood on a person with the potential to
receive further Activations grants half a Physical and Halo Activation each and has the chance to horribly
deform the recipient."
47,,250CP,An Artificer's Dream,Generic Exalted,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Pick a magical material from the following of Jade, Orichalum, Starmetal, Soulsteel, Moonsilver, and
Adamant. You now have a source of it provided for you in your warehouse every week, roughly 50lbs
worth. If you pick Jade you get 50lbs of each of the five types of Jade. None of this stuff is actually made
into anything yet but if you've got the crafting skills you could easily change that. If you pick Starmetal
note that you'll probably have the largest (and only regenerating) source of Starmetal in all of Creation.
Don't let your enemies find out. In fact, don't let anyone find out you have a regenerating source of any
of these materials, whole nations have been put to the torch for less. Magical Materials are incredibly
useful, and critical, in the construction of artifacts.
* Moonsilver supply is provided by another item so i'm excluding that from the cost multiplier"
48,,300CP,Arcane Resources,Ravenwood,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A supply of high quality, magically-active materials. Such materials are useful in the process of casting
spells of various sorts, able to act as foci for various spells, or can be used in the creation of potions or
artefacts (as described in the Natural Magic perk). Comes with several schematics for potions and
artefacts that can be made with these materials. Additionally, this comes with a travel case that can
contain up to 16 potions. Potions contained within this imprint to the slot they are placed in for the next
24 hours, at which point the potions respawn the day after they are used. Placing a different potion in
the slot allows it to imprint the new potion."
49,,300CP,Mana Gems,World Seed,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"One rather important power source used in many energy-hungry magitech devices, and also popular
with mages and enchanters, are mana gems. But due to their nature, they cannot be artificially created,
only forming after several years of mana condensing and purifying in a single location. This commonly
happens only on asteroids, where they can be left undisturbed for long periods of time, and truly vast
mana veins can form. But even as mining them can be a hassle, their value makes it worth anyone's
while, as they are capable of holding and regenerating massive amounts of mana, with the exact
volumes depending on the gem's size and quality. And it seems like you've hit the jackpot, as with this
you'll be able to gain a steady supply of mana gems each week. You may decide on a case by case basis
whether you want several dozen small and low-quality mana gems, or two to three big and high-quality
ones."
50,,300CP,Super Sea Snails,Splatoon,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You have a small breeding population of around 10 Super Sea Snails, large snails with crystalline, conical
shells. The snails are hermaphroditic and they live for around 15 years. They're more than they seem,
they provide an invaluable service- Their shells can be used to imbue hats, shirts, and pairs of shoes with
extra Ability Slots, or reroll the abilities of a clothing item with 3 full slots. This kills the Sea Snail, but if
you're careful to keep up the population then eventually you might have an entire wardrobe of 3-slot
clothing. Also, they're delicious when cooked right."
51,,300CP,The Holy Grail,Iron sky,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Well now. This is a cup weighing 84 ounces, an endless source of the wonder chemical known as Vril. Vril
is a chemical that is behind all of the Vrilian technology in this world, providing unlimited energy,
immortality, regeneration and incredibly heightened physical abilities.
With a direct drink from this vessel you would be instantly cured of all ailments, and your physical
strength is raised to such heights that you can kill a T-Rex with one hit. Plugged in as a power source,
which is as simple as dipping wires in it, the grail provides an unlimited amount of any and all energies
you might care to ask of it. Even chocolates made of it are enough to reverse decades of aging and fix
any diseases plaguing the body. You also get an unlimited supply of these chocolates."
52,,400CP,A Piece Of Shit Dragon Shit That Is!,SAO abridged,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A legendary crafting material, this can be used to create the most powerful melee weapon in the game.
Whether you want a sword, axe, hammer or whatever, just put this on an anvil, focus on what you want,
hit it with a hammer and boom, instant master weapon! It's nigh unbreakable, only able to be destroyed
by the one who made it, or divine-level hax, should that happen, the weapon will shatter, and this will
reappear in your warehouse immediately. If you want, you can instead use this process to enhance a
weapon you already own, absorbing its qualities into the metal permanently, should this process render
the metal truly unbreakable, you can still break it if you really want to and still work it just as easily as
ever"
53,,400CP,Aethertapping,Aion,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You have been taught how to extract Aether from vortices, which can then be used by daeva to catalyze
their crafting. Post-Jump, you will be able to find the occasional vortice-like anomaly spread across the
setting seemingly at random, which you will be able to draw aether out of. They'll be invisible and
undetectable to anyone who doesn't have this perk, however.
You have mastery in this art, and make post-jump vortice-anomalies considerably more common."
54,,400CP,Alchemic Metals,Generic Isekai,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A cubic meter each of mithril, adamant its, and orichalcum. Each of these metals is incredibly scarce and
powerful, possessing unique properties. Mythril is highly conductive to energy, unnaturally light despite
its hardness, and blades made of it will not dull when cutting mundane materials. Adamantite is
considered to be the second hardest substance on earth, and is highly magic resistant, allowing most
spells to simply slide off it. Orichalcum, called the divine metal, will resist any external force short of the
divine and has no known melting point. This supply restocks once per jump, but there are rumours of a
method to synthesise these metals from base ingredients; a method that has been lost for centuries."
55,,400CP,Bag of Junk,Divinity - Original Sin,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A large sack that seemed filled with the oddest assortment of trash and rubbish you've ever seen.
There's a bottle of mud that seems to swirl inside its jar no matter how hard you shake it or how long
you leave it to rest on a shelf. There's an amulet of battered tin in the shake on a buffalo. There's a
shrivelled old heart that somehow is still weakly beating and warm to the touch. There's even an old
sabre in here, rusted and chipped and all but falling apart. Seriously, what is all this even good for?
* The Notes say that stuff is used to craft legendary swords in the game"
56,,400CP,Forbidden Treasure,Generic Exalted,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You looking for some weird stuff? Maybe the bottled laughter of a newborn infant, or the dream of a
maddened artist? How about the color of the sunset as seen from a specific mountain peak found only in
The South? Well if you buy this option you'll have those things. 200cp gets you a regular source every
week in your warehouse of relatively hard to find exotic resources and reagents which can be used to
dramatically aid in the speed and efficiency of artifact creation. For 400cp you get a larger amount every
week of far more exotic things. Trapped Essence of Yozi, a fragment of the twisted dreams of the
Neverborn, and a thousand and one things never before seen or imagined spawned from the twisting
madness found only in the absolute heart of the Wyld. You may direct what specific kind of resource you
get each week if you have some specific need or desire in mind, and may freely choose something
different the next week."
57,,400CP,Gemavic,Gemcraft-Frostborn Wrath,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"This perk allows you to summon gems made of different materials using gemcraft, including materials
from other jumps. This only works if the material is a transparent or translucent crystal, unfortunately.
Most materials are much worse for conducting magic than crystalized mana, but perhaps you can find a
use for a diamond the size of a living room? Non-Magical gems are exceptionally cheap to create you
know, since they're essentially sparkly paperweights. Feel free to be creative with shapes."
58,,400CP,Lifeblood Weapon,Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Lifeblood Weapons are tools that grow with those they are bound to. This particular weapon comes in
whatever form you wish, even as a set of weapons, and is already at the level of a Chaos Weapon. Unlike
other lifeblood weapons, all this one needs is to feed on your energy to grow to your level of power. It is
however much quicker to feed it precious materials. You may import any past weapons into this role.
* Chaos Weapons can destroy solar system sized mini universes with one swing."
59,,400CP,Mini-Hakkero,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You have a mystical, magical furnace shaped like an octagon and made of hihi’irokane. Each corner is
emblazoned with a different trigram with different powers, such as generating a lot of heat, producing a
cool breeze for hot days, and the ability to amplify magic through it to blast a Master Spark – enough to
reduce a mountain to ashes. As such a potent magical item, it’s very handy for magical research too."
60,,400CP,Oni Treasures,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You have in your possession the four treasures of the Oni. The first is the Ibuki Gourd, a stylish large
purple gourd with a stopper that has been soaked in the extract of a Sake Bug. Even a little bit of water in
here somehow multiplies into a vast quantity of sake, though it never produces more than the gourd can
hold at a time. With this treasure, you could easily ensure you never spend another moment of your life
sober. The second is Douju’s Jar, a large waist-high pot full of an endless amount of edible oil with no
unusual properties beyond tasting smooth and nice. Perhaps you might want to establish a deep-frying
business? The third is the Hoshiguma Dish, a simple red sake dish that has the miraculous ability to raise
the quality of any sake poured into it, making it taste much better and be far easier to drink. Note that
the sake does not need to remain in the dish to benefit from the increased quality; pouring it into the
dish and then pouring it out into another container is a perfectly valid way to amass a lot of high-quality
sake. However, sake can only benefit from its blessing once. The fourth, and most potent, is the Ibaraki
Box of a Hundred Medicines, a decorated sake box that can hold two liters of liquid at a time. Should a
healthy person drink alcohol from the sake box, it temporarily grants them the strength of an Oni for a
day at the price of shifting their personality to be like an Oni’s (read: crude, brash, coarse, loud and
belligerent) until it wears off. If a sick, injured or otherwise unhealthy person drinks from it, however, it
cures all of their ailments barring incurable mutilation from powerful magical relics at the small cost of
permanently transforming their body into that of an Oni – though some might say this is simply another
bonus. If a lot of people were to drink from this box, you can be assured it would cause incredible
amounts of chaos."
61,,400CP,Painting Book,Wonderland No More,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A watercolor set (with case, brush and paints) that comes with a couple-dozen-page book full of outlined
drawings of various Wonderland beings and landscapes, waiting to be colored in. Once you’ve fully
colored in the picture, the subject “comes to life” just as it was painted, right in front of the painter.
These painting creations are fully loyal to the painter, though you can command them to behave like the
real-life versions would. Each colored picture is replaced by a new drawing outline in a day (the random
pictures all generally depict various things from Wonderland)."
62,,400CP,Potted Stardust,Divinity - Original Sin,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"The Stardust plant is a hardy, quick growing flower with peachy-red colored petals standing up on spindly
stalks with large, wide fern-like leaves growing from the base. It is highly sought after by women who use
the golden dust that clings to its flower petals to enhance their beauty, but that is only the least of its
uses. The golden dust is highly magical and can be easily used for crafting a variety of magical items.
Everything from magical swords to voodoo dolls can be created with a pouch full of this stuff. The flower
in this pot will generate one small pouch of dust every few days and will never need tending to. Should it
be killed, a fresh pot will appear in your proximity within a week."
63,,400CP,Ritual Pigments,Dishonored 2,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A selection of paint pigments in more than a dozen colours, each colour conveniently prepared from
precise ingredients and according to very specific methods needed to use paintings as a ritual for
conducting sympathetic magic no need to wait for certain phases of the moon, nor collect certain weeds
in a container made of a human skull. Put simply, what you paint in the painting can be imposed onto
reality, or what is in reality can be transferred into the painting.
There are enough pigments here to do one painting which affects a room-sized area, allowing goods to
be conjured, things within the area to be altered or removed, or to turn the painting itself into a roomsized
pocket dimension. You could paint a painting of an empty room and add in a pile of silver to the
painting, to sympathetically conjure a pile of silver into the real room, or you could paint a picture of the
room without its door, which will magically remove the door from the wall of the real room, preventing
all access.
Unfortunately painting ephemeral things souls, magic, auras, power still does not make them appear in
reality. You could also use these paints to move something out of reality and into the painting, such as
valuables or a prisoner, concealing or trapping them inside it. If you should possess Voidheart and
Endless Black, you will find the scale of this power magnified you could create an entire world of
phantasy within the painting to enter, or call forth from your canvas a change to affect an entire city."
64,,400CP,Seeds of Potential,Exalted - The Infernals,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Just as Malfeas has its own forms of vegetation, so too does it have its own forms of farming. These
plants tend to be made of metals such as tin or brass, though the will of a powerful demon can result in
other substances. As the woods of Creation, these metal-woods can be set aflame, albeit only through a
specific method employing a firedrill, logs from Vitalius or Hrotsvitha, and demon ichor. Other sorts of
fire will not ignite metallic Malfean vegetation, and their metallic flames might melt other sorts of fuel
but will not set them afire. Paper will not burn on a fire of metallic logs, and would only be heated. If
smelted and cast into new form, the metals of Malfeas lose this property. Their means of cultivation also
diverge greatly from those found in Creation. Malfean crops rarely require anything so simple as plowing,
sowing and reaping. Instead, they might require to be grown from human finger bones planted in the
ground, bear fruit only to the beating of drums, or release their harvest only at the sacrifice of a living
demon.
Now I will offer to you a collection of five kinds of seeds. One kind of the ivy of gray lead, one of the
bloodmelon vines, one of the malice-nut tree, one of the squash vines of black porcelain, and one of the
brass-stemmed roses with petals of green-black glass that grow only in rare parts of hell. All of these will
grow where you will, as long as they are properly cared for, and the collection will replenish in number in
case you wish to start additional gardens.
And lastly, I shall offer you these three seeds of potential, harvested from Oramus' slumbering templebody.
While they come in lesser number, and will not be replaced as the collection of lesser seeds will
be, they are far more remarkable. For if they are pierced by a spike of metal or any other material and
planted in the ground, and then regularly fed with a prayer for its growth, these will grow into the
seedlings of new trees or plants incorporating the spike's materials. Of course, as a new species you'll
have to discover the ways to cultivate them further yourself, and the rarer materials may give you more
difficulty... but with a wise selection of ores and minerals, it may be well worth it."
65,,400CP,Terragene Crystals,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"There's dangerous items, and then there's this thing. A relic from the Kree Empire, these crystals are
often sealed inside a container called a Diviner in order to ensure the mist that these crystals spread is
kept in check. Why so? Well, the mist causes any who contain the right genetic code to undergo
Terrigenesis, where their body becomes enveloped in a stonelike cocoon before breaking open and
granting superhuman powers... sometimes with physical changes to help. If they don't have the proper
genetic code, then they merely turn to stone before crumbling into pieces. Do be careful."
66,,400CP,Twin Corns,Monster Girl Encyclopedia,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Two hollowed out Bicorn horns that make for good drinking cups. Whenever different liquids are poured
into one of the cups, they are instantly mixed together. Similarly, any energies applied to the cup are
converted to a liquid form and mixed together; also, the energy of each individual person has its own
unique flavor. Each cup can hold up to three liquids together, but if you lock the two horns together and
shake them, the liquids of both horns will merge, and you can use a small opening at the tip of either
horn to drink the full cocktail – thus receiving the unique blend of different liquids/energy types fused
together."

more uses for music than Wraithbone alone. In the way the Bonesinger shapes Wraithbone with psychic
energy and their voice, so do you shape the green and growing things. Vegetation springs from the
earth, seemingly from nothing, at the sound of your voice, molding itself to fit your needs. Should you
grow hungry, bring forth fruit. Should you grow hot, bring forth shade. Should you grow weary, bring
forth a bed of leaves. All these shall heed your song."
68,,500CP,Treasure Mimic,Dark Souls 3,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"A large wooden chest divided into three compartments. The left compartment contains twenty pieces of
Twinkling Titanite, the right compartment contains twenty Titanite Scales and the middle compartment
contains an assorted shards and chunks of normal Titanite.
Titanite is a good, strong metal good for weapons and armor among other things, as well as reinforcing
equipment. Twinkling Titanite is handy for the reinforcement of equipment steeped in strength, baring
unique abilities, without diminishing those properties, though it's somewhat poor for crafting.
Titanite Scales are left behind by Crystal Lizards that grow to immense sizes after devouring souls, and
are the ideal material for reinforcing equipment made through Soul Transposition. All three being handy
materials for a blacksmith though. Titanite originating from the chest will slowly replenish over time
once used for something. Theassorted normal Titanite will replenish one piece every hour or so, while
the special varieties usually take a couple days per piece.
In reality, the chest is a loyal mimic that guards these resources and whatever else you put inside. If need
be, it can even reveal itself to fight a would-be thief or carry out simple instructions. When walking
about, two long arms and a huge tongue protrude from the inside, teeth grow along the edges of the lid
and a long, lanky, deceptively powerful body stretches out of the bottom."
69,,600CP,Font of Power,Generic Xianxia,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"You aren't quite sure what this is supposed to be exactly, but this altar-ish looking Warehouse
attachment seems to give off vast amounts of the stuff you can manipulate or feed upon. You'd never go
hungry, and you could fight a great battle using just the stuff from this and not have to fuel any of it
yourself. In fact, unless you were trying to fight a galaxy-destroyer or something you wouldn't have cause
to draw on more stuff than this thing can provide. Maybe this is some relic of your elders?"
70,,600CP,The Dragons Blessing,The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"The pieces of the Spirit Dragons that wander Hyrule are truly potent, even their scales and pieces of
their horn could easily take a mundane traveler's sword up to a hero's weapon! Their inherent magic and
power is such that, for any crafting(from cooking to elixir mixing to weapon crafting to even casting
enchantments) they are one of the best ingredients you can find. But the Spirit Dragons are elusive, and
dangerous to harvest from. You have been gifted a small collection of Dragon parts to use at your leisure,
which will replenish every fortnight."
71,,750CP,"Crafting Materials, Supplies and Tools | Legendary Treasury",Overlord - The Series,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"Crafting Materials, Supplies and Tools (600CP) You have the good fortune of possessing a regenerating
stock of high end crafting materials suitable across all fields of crafting, alongside the tools and workshop
space in order to make something with them (you must supply the actual skill on your own however).
Materials for low-end magical items (ie: Greater tier or below, as explained at the beginning of the item
section) regularly resupply such that you could probably churn out hundreds of such items a day. Legacy
tier materials would allow you to craft a few things a day. Materials for equipment at the Relic tier
resupply often enough you could probably make a single relic tier item a day. This is the limit for the 300
CP option.
For 600 CP however your materials now include enough for a single Legendary tier piece of equipment
every two weeks or so, and the materials for a single piece of Divine Tier equipment would likely take at
least two months. However, there is nothing preventing you from stockpiling the materials, as they'll
keep resupplying themselves even if not used up. This may either be a warehouse attachment or
attached to another property at your desire, either way it will always have enough space inside to store
materials for crafting things, will always be neatly arranged, organized, and labeled, and will be perfectly
capable of storing or maintaining even the most volatile or fragile of substances. Both levels of this
option are discounted to those that have purchased the Crafting Class perk.
Legendary Treasury (Overlord (The Series) Guild Base Supplement) (150CP) Your guild base is famous,
or perhaps infamous, for the mind boggling amount of treasure it contains within. Or it would be
assuming anyone knew about it. You have enough Yggdrasil gold coins within to keep your guild base
going for hundreds of years, and it is littered with powerful high tier magic items of all shapes and sizes,
and an even more excessive number of low and mid tier magical items. Barring truly foolish spending
habits or ruinous expenses you should likely never need to worry about your treasury running out of
gold to support the guild base. In future worlds it will refill with equivalent amounts of gold, and new
magic items suitable for the world it finds itself in. Additionally, and finally, it is now of arbitrary internal
size. There will always be more room and more space to add in any treasures or items you come across,
as the treasury will expand to fit them as you add them inside.
If you or a Companion also purchased the Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools item from the regular
Overlord (the series) jump document then this Legendary Treasury will also be filled with copious
amounts of reagents and crafting materials, of appropriate qualities and levels for whatever version of
the Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools option you purchased. In future worlds it will fill up with more
as appropriate to the world(s) you've been to."
72,,800CP,Caloric Stone,Overlord - The Series,Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale,"The actual origin or source of the Caloric Stone is a near total mystery. It forms only from large
concentrations of the Seven Prismatic Ores, legendary divine materials that possess qualities far and
away above anything else. Why this occurs, or even who first discovered the Caloric Stone, is unknown.
While held the Caloric Stone grants the usual benefits of a World Item upon its bearer, providing
protections against negative status, instant death, being trapped or held, scryed upon, and so forth,
trumping even the effects of other World Items. However, while useful, those are far and away the least
impressive aspects of the stone. The truth of the matter is quite simple; the Caloric Stone is the ultimate
crafting material. No matter what you are making, no matter how mighty, no matter what other
materials are included, adding the Caloric Stone will make that item or bit of craftsmanship better.
Food, drink, weapons, armor, buildings, vehicles, golems, indeed anything that can be crafted can be
quantifiably made superior (by an astounding degree) by the inclusion of the Caloric Stone in its creation
process, as the stone expands the possibilities and power of what can be done with crafting. If you were
to use particularly mighty materials in the creation of something, say ingredients on par with those
usually used in the making of a Divine Tier item, the resulting piece of equipment would be truly
legendary, halfway between the status of a Divine tier item and a World Item. Obviously, and
unfortunately, the stone is expended when used.
However, since you're paying at a premium, you are guaranteed to receive a new Caloric Stone exactly
one month after using it, appearing in whatever location is most convenient for you. You may explicitly
hand this to other people but you need not fear losing it. If separated from your person in a fashion you
didn't intend it will appear in the closest convenient location for you a day later. However if it was used
in this time frame to make something then you must still wait a month for it to respawn. The Caloric
Stone is discounted for those that purchased the 600 CP option for Crafting Materials, Supplies, and
Tools. The Caloric Stone is utterly unique, and cannot be duplicated or copied via any method
whatsoever using in-jump methods."
