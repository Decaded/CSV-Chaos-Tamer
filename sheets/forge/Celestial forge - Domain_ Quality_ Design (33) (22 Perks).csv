1,,100CP,Artistic Architect ,Halo - Forerunner Saga,Domain: Quality: Design,"Forerunner structures are not simple. Even in the worst of times, there is a beauty to their layout. Patterns woven into walls, shining pillars reaching to the sky, and shimmering glass panes adjourning corridors. Forerunners don't just build big. They build artfully. Like so many other Builders, you have an eye, and a hand, for beauty in construction. From the most simple of floors, to the most terrifying of weapons, you can spruce them up so that they are breathtaking to behold."
2,,100CP,Customized Weapons ,XCOM,Domain: Quality: Design,"You know that efficiency is number one, because waste is a thief. You know how to make the best designs better, and will ensure that the equipment in use is ergonomic, streamlined, and efficient."
3,,100CP,Hull Architect ,Endless Space,Domain: Quality: Design,"You know how to design ships. From nose to engine, you could draft up a functional space worthy ship. On paper. Putting all the pieces together maybe beyond you, but anyone who puts it together will agree, it's a mighty fine ship"
4,,100CP,My Watch Doesn't Tell Time ,Honkai Impact Third,Domain: Quality: Design,"The further you stray from the intended use of a device's style or look the better a device it becomes by default. If you make a watch that can't tell time you could cram a ton of things into it despite it's relatively tiny size. The shape or style must be a recognized thing, like a watch or a phone in order to benefit from the boost."
5,,100CP,Survey ,Green Worldz,Domain: Quality: Design,"A simple little survey that, when filled out, reveals the ideal weapon parameters for any given individual. The default length is 239 questions, but the survey becomes longer and more comprehensive as your crafting skills and resources become more diverse. As long as a person fills out the survey truthfully (and they are compelled to do so when faced with this version), the resulting weapon will be a truly one-of-a-kind tool perfectly matched to their personality and fighting style."
6,,100CP,Weapon Modifications ,Archer,Domain: Quality: Design,"You design and modify weapons with flair, creativity, and skill."
7,,100CP,Wired Watchmaker ,Arcanum Of Steamworks And Magic Obscura,Domain: Quality: Design,"Long hours hunched over the machinery and books that define your profession have left you with a keen eye for detail. Your eyesight is excellent even in the occasionally poorly-lit workshops you frequent, and your mind has sharpened to the point you'll easily remember the details of any schematic you're trying to assemble. You can still wear that monocle of course, but this time, you'll wear it for style!"
8,,200CP,A Legacy of Innovation ,Final Fantasy X,Domain: Quality: Design,"The Al Bhed have a long history – spanning back to a time when their name was not even Al Bhed to begin with, but all throughout, they have been on the forefront of development, out of necessity rather than convenience. If there’s a task to be done, you can adapt Machina to do it – not that it’ll be effective for the job or efficient, but at least you’ll get an extra pair of helping hands. That has to count for something right? 
Ah, right, you do have to assemble it yourself, but no worries, you’ll get quicker at assembling Machina with all the practice you’ll get, of that I’m certain."
9,,200CP,ARTIFICER ,PREY,Domain: Quality: Design,"Any monkey with a wrench can look up the technical manual and do a repair. Well, maybe not any monkey, but you're certainly a cut above the rest. Any technology you come across that you understand the principles behind can be drastically improved. Either simplifying it to make it easier to fabricate or improving its durability or power output. Weapons, turrets, tools and vehicles can all be improved beyond their base specs."
10,,200CP,Lab Standards ,Starbound,Domain: Quality: Design,"You are comfortable around technology. You can deduce what complex machines do, at least as far as scientific principles go, and once you understand them, you can standardize them. Technology that you study can be converted into generic versions which may be weaker or less versatile but are easier to maintain and produce. You also can follow the most complicated techno-jargon as if it was plain English."
11,,300CP,Engineer ,Super Mario RPG,Domain: Quality: Design,You're more adept at coming up with novel and creative objects. Any blueprint can be held perfectly in your mind without needing to draw it on paper.
12,,400CP,Counter Technology ,A Certain Magical Index + A Certain Scientific Railgun,Domain: Quality: Design,"Some powers or technology have weaknesses and especially those Esper abilities have one and you made this into an art on your own. You have a preternatural ability to create and invent technology to counter and neutralize any powers or technology that you have encountered or have enough knowledge off and make them powerless and useless. So long the powers or technology that you want to neutralize is running the same system, using the same element or working in the same principles your counters will work with all of them without problems. The technologies that you built are impossible to reverse-engineer without your consent even using magic or forcefully analyzing it through technology even if they are trillions of years more advanced than yours."
13,,400CP,Enhancement Mastery ,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,Domain: Quality: Design,Just by looking at a piece of technology you are able to consider different ways on how it might be improved. Whether its increasing damage for weapons or decreasing power draw for components there is always some way to improve an item. This also improves your Valkyrie's Core innate ability to enhance items.
14,,400CP,Innovator ,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Domain: Quality: Design,"It's a pain, isn't it? Seeing all these people who just don't seem to realize how much they can do with their incredible powers. Well, that's not something you need to worry about, at least. You have an incredible imagination, coupled with a ridiculous degree of technical capability. You're able to come up with new uses for practically anything and everything you see, from jutsu to seals.
Whatever it is, you just seem to 'know' how to apply them in all sorts of clever, innovative ways to achieve great results. This is only a side-advantage though. Your real skill lies in playing around with the techniques and abilities themselves. You have a ridiculously great ability to modify, break down and recreate any and all techniques, be they Taijutsu, Genjutsu, Ninjutsu or even specific bloodline applications.
You don't actually learn them any faster but once you have learned them your mind unleashes a veritable flood of ideas for improving them, applying them in ways no one has ever thought of, boosting their power or broadness though simple tricks, merging disparate techniques, lifting principles and elements from one and applying them to the other, coming up with new variants... and these are just a few examples of what you can do to them. If it still needs to be said, this also massively advances your ability to come up with new tricks and techniques, and lets you easily combo any already-compatible skills and abilities for maximum synergy."
15,,400CP,Modularity ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Design,"Hardware incompatibilities are a pain to deal with. Thankfully, you design your stuff to connect together like Lego pieces. You know just how to design and create hardware that is capable of being put together piece by piece rather easily, allowing you to create consoles that can have internal parts replaced like a PC. You can also design your stuff so that it can hold a host of attachments, like a VR headset that connects to your controller or a console with a built-in charging station. If you want to keep adding more and more, that's just what you can do now."
16,,400CP,Schizo-tech Expert ,Arcanum: Of Steamworks And Magick Obscura,Domain: Quality: Design,"Technology advances in leaps and bounds, which may leave the enterprising inventor with some compatibility issues. After all, upgrading the old model of steam-powered Automaton with an electromagnetic hydraulics system may give it the dexterity to paint works of art as much as cleave your foes in half, but that's hardly a success if the optical systems receive interference and rend your servitor blind! You've become exceedingly adept at integrating multiple kinds of technology, especially when the various parts would normally be incompatible. Using different energy sources, blending outdated design principles with the latest advancements of the future and more are all within your grasp. Incredible!"
17,,400CP,The Next Step ,DOOM 3,Domain: Quality: Design,"The UAC is pushing the boundaries of known science, and it's no wonder that a lot of the Mars facilities are dedicated to cutting-edge and somewhat poorly tested technologies. After all, testing how exactly things work is one of the reasons we do science! That said, there's no reason not to push for the best possible results right from the start, and you embody this ideal and then some. You have become highly adept at developing prototype systems incorporating new fields of science, to the point your initial designs are usually as good as (if not better) than those others might come up with after two or three rounds of testing, debugging and fine-tuning. Likewise, you can glean far greater insights from any such development cycles you implement, meaning that this 'head start' is only going to get bigger the more time you put into your R&D. This Perk grants you a 50CP stipend which you may use in the UAC Equipment Catalog section found later in this document."
18,,400CP,Weaponization ,Mega Man Classic,Domain: Quality: Design,"Your understanding of machines is such that, given an ordinary lumber-cutting robot, you can easily rebuild and reprogram minor worker robots into trained fighters. A lumber-cutting robot becomes a dangerous axeman, and the equivalent of the average Joe for a robot turns into a deadly sniper. In general you are capable of making machines more powerful while retooling them to suit your purpose. That pipe dream of turning a workforce into an army isn't too far fetched now."
19,,600CP,Infinitely Customizable | Modular Designs ,Dead Space,Domain: Quality: Design,"Infinitely Customizable (200CP) It's not that your guns are bad, by any stretch of the imagination, it's just that they could be so, so much better. And now you can actually do that. In this world, tools and weapons are aided by nano-scale circuitry, which leaves a lot of room for improvement, typically in the form of power nodes being welded into specific places to provide extra power to certain subsystems of the weapon, to increase power output, ammo count/efficiency, and even unlock special abilities, like setting enemies on fire, or exploding violently. As an added benefit, you also get the ability to break weapons and tools down into parts - specifically frames, tools, tips, accessories, and upgrade chips, see the Notes section for more information - and reconfigure them to your liking. You can even upgrade those parts individually using power nodes.
Modular Designs (400CP) It's always easier to make better things from better materials, and your knowledge of far-future engineering is top-notch, meaning that all of the things you make are all that much better for it. Aside from being able to upgrade parts, tools, and weapons further, and make better base parts for tools and weapons, you can apply the bonuses of Infinitely Customizable to things other than tools and weapons, breaking anything down into classes of modular parts and swapping them around to your heart's content. This nearly obviates every part of the process of retro-fitting older creations with newer parts, aside from the actual manual labor and time."
20,,600CP,Making Virtual a Reality ,Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Quality: Design,"First came the controller, then much later motion sensing, and later still Virtual Reality, with the future holding untold possibilities. But not for long. You have the ability to design and create just about any kind of hardware imaginable, with such marvels as game controllers that shape themselves to their user's hands or real life holodecks being well within your grasp should you have enough time. This works beyond the scope of video game technology, as well, allowing you to make things like computerized fans that turn on above a set temperature, or things like self- driving cars."
21,,600CP,Sum of its Parts ,Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Quality: Design,"You understand how to create expandable systems, keeping complexity low while still allowing for different materials or more production to be added in the future. Complex systems make sense to you. You can see the logic behind even the oddest bit of system design, and you can expand it if you find the reasoning sound. Finally, the bigger the system or factory you created is, the more productive it is. Adding more machines makes everything faster and more efficient."
22,,600CP,The Legacy of /m/ ,World Seed,Domain: Quality: Design,"Looks like you've watched a few too many anime of a previous century. Or too few, depending on who you ask. Nevertheless, seeing several mechas combine into one giant mecha has inspired you to develop a certain skill set, one that allowed you to take the concept of combination and run with it. As long as you have the time and resources, you can easily build things such as several spaceships that combine into one large mecha able to fight space monsters in melee, with its pilots linking their minds to fight as one, that will be far stronger than the sum of its parts. If you ever come upon a race with collective chuunibyou, I'm sure you'd find many friends in them.
You can also build similar technology that is smaller in scale, like for example autonomously fighting swords that combine together for a devastating final attack, or something as advanced as nanite swarms able to transform into almost anything you could possibly conceive of. Furthermore, with some work you could also combine devices that weren't designed to do so, taking their best parts but leaving out their individual flaws to make something exponentially more powerful or useful than either of the originals.
Somehow, you are able to do this without the end product ending up any larger, clunkier, or needing more energy. So making the most powerful gun you are able to build, but which uses up an inordinate amount of energy, and combining it with the most energy efficient one in your arsenal is a real possibility open to you."
