0,,CP Cost,Name,Jumpdoc,Chapter,Description
1,,50CP,Tentacles,Generic Hentai Tentacles,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Your main appendage. Prehensile with genitals at the end. Ravishing your target with them feeds you.
Capable of grasping, pulling and pushing. May have to use several for pushing buttons. First purchase is
free. Each purchase after costs 50 cp. Each purchase grants you four tentacles."
2,,100CP,Download' Blueprints,Heat Signature,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You know or obtain the general layout of any ship you enter. Applies to buildings too, radius 50m."
3,,100CP,A Humble Mushroom Farmer,Paper Mario,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The Mushroom Kingdom is a land of many strange and mysterious items. Healing mushrooms, small
snowmen that call up blizzards, blocks labelled POW that shake the earth. These items have to come
from somewhere, and now you are a source of these objects. You know the arts behind the creation of
the various usable items from the paper mario series. Some of these must be grown, others built, and
still others prepared through more esoteric means. You also know how to create lil' oink eggs and use
them to produce certain items. The ingredients for many of these are rather common in that world, but
rarer elsewhere. I'd stock up if I were you."
4,,100CP,Analysis,Red Alert 3,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You can immediately identify any defects in hardware upon casual observation. This is effective on
devices, Vehicles, and buildings."
5,,100CP,Bibliophile’s Discerning Eyes,Touhou Forbidden Hermit,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You can read anything no matter what language it's written in. This does not come with the ability to write in that language, but you can read it if it's a language at all. Including dead and forgotten languages – an invaluable skill if you wish to do serious historical research – but not encoded texts.
FREE: Spell Cards - The Spell Card system was invented to ensure that youkai and humans could fight each other in a non-lethal way and on relatively even ground. Under a spell card duel, all attacks are toned down to non-lethal levels, and the ability to fire an aesthetically pleasing barrage of bullets inall directions is prized over creating unavoidable attacks or invulnerability (which are banned anyway). Accordingly, you too can tone any of your abilities down as low as simply performing pretty light shows, and as your artistic skills improve so will the beauty of your spell card attacks.
FREE: Flight: You can fly, a power that is nigh-universal in Gensokyo. Flying as fast as you can walk is simple, and you can push yourself to fly faster, up to how fast you can run, which will tire you proportionately.
FREE: Cute Girls - Nobody in these manga are anything but cute, and by taking this perk you share this same trait. For free, all minor traits that would detract from your appearance (including blemishes, bodily hair and especially armpit hair) are cleared up.
Spell cards added: Magic Sign ""Stardust Reverie"", Love Sign ""Master Spark"", Comet ""Blazing Star"", Magic Sign ""Milky Way"""
6,,100CP,By the Numbers,Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You know how much of any given resource your industries and organizations are producing, and how
much potential for production there is for each resource."
7,,100CP,Demonic Augmentation,Hellgate London,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You can successfully graft demonic parts onto yourself to gain an increase in mana reserves as well as
gaining the ability to more easily cast certain spells based on the demon's type. You also learn to craft
demonic focus items that, while weaker than augmentations, also don't have to be grafted onto your
body."
8,,100CP,Empathy,Generic Hentai Superheroes,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You can sense emotions. Even better, you can project them. Calm a scared child. Project awe towards the
people as you float in. Make them fear you. Make them lust for you
a. Basic: Telekinesis, teleportation. Precognition of up to a 15 minutes"
9,,100CP,Engineer,Megas XLR,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You're a talented and knowledgeable multi discipline engineer, particularly skilled in everything you
could ever need to maintain Megas and similar war machines."
10,,100CP,Engineering Basics,Dead Space,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You're a real Mr. Fix-It, y'know? Malfunctioning fuel intake? Easy. Faulty asteroid defense cannon? Turn it
off, then on again. Non-responsive communications array? Shuffle the working emitters around a bit so
they're symmetrical. Undead monstrosities? Depends on what you mean by, ""fix."" Does using a rivet gun
to blow them apart count? Yes? Then we're good."
11,,100CP,Green Eye,Earth Girls,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The most important skill for an herbalist is to tell what a plant is, of course. You can identify by sight or
smell alone every plant that grows for miles around and tell if a plant you've never seen before is edible
or toxic."
12,,100CP,I Know Things,Marvel Cosmic,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"What use is genius if no one will listen? How can one save the day or take over the galaxy if they are
ignored? This ensures that will never be a problem for you. You know things and people know that. They
will no longer scoff at or ignore your scientific ramblings so long as you know what you are talking about.
You can always convince people to accept facts so long as you can explain them. People will also accept
your knowledge of things as equivalent to a physical item of equal value when discussing bartering or
trading. You can't bullshit with this perk. You have to actually be right and know the thing for it to be
taken seriously."
13,,100CP,IMPACT CALIBRATION,PREY,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Also known as percussive maintenance. You're good at repairing things, simple items can be repaired
with a few spare parts and a wrench, which is fortunate because most of Talos I's equipment is simple for
ease of fabrication. Of course you can fix almost anything with the right parts and a little time and now
know just the right way to smack an item with a wrench to fix minor faults (Or knock someone dead)."
14,,100CP,Legion Trained,A Practical Guide to Evil,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"One Sin. Defeat. One Grace. Victory. These are the words that every member of the Legion lives by.
You've been trained in the legions, and are proficient with rank-to-rank fighting with the gladius and
scutum, the usage of goblin munitions, and mass spellcasting (assuming, of course, that you're capable
of spellcasting). Furthermore, you know how to create goblin munitions, including the magic-eating
goblinfire. While this won't let you stand up to a Hero on it's own, the discipline of a legionnaire and
their skill against others on their level is not to be doubted. As one of the Named yourself? Well, this
level of skill can be quite effective, though it's enhanced with the assistance of fellow warriors."
15,,100CP,MacGyver,Andromeda,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You are a natural at fixing and jury rigging things. As long as you have the parts and tools you can fix
nearly anything. You also have the capability to build emergency equipment that can help to save your
life and the lives of others, but these tend to be one offs given the time crunch you are usually under."
16,,100CP,Medicine,GUNNM,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You have the skills of a surgeon, first-responder and pharmacist, all roughly bundled together with a lot
of hands-on experience with the worst injuries the wasteland has to offer. Your hands are steady, your
focus unperturbed by the sight and stench of gore and viscera, and you have the precise and quick
reflexes necessary to swat a fly with a scalpel. You also have a fair bit of experience with slightly inhuman
and mutated physiology, and are very quick to pick up on new techniques and tools."
17,,100CP,Programming,World Seed,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Through hard hours spent slaving over a hot keyboard you have learned the art of programming, you
could write a program for pretty much anything, please don't try to steal peoples bank accounts."
18,,100CP,Resourcefulness,Generic Xianxia,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You instinctively know how to make the best with what you have. You know that a rope can be burned as
well as tied, that water can drown as well as cleanse, and that spiritual power can be used to do much
more than simply destroy. You also have a very good idea of what an ability or skill can do, even out of
context - a punch can shake fruit off of their branches, a technique that generates fire can be used to
cook and cauterize, and dangerous wild beasts can be goaded into attacking your adversaries. In short,
you understand how to use your abilities and resources at hand in creative ways that many would not
have considered, potentially giving you an advantage against more rigid or less creative opponents."
19,,100CP,Rites of Maintenance,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"While already designed to be incredibly robust, Imperial equipment inevitably requires maintenance.
You can locate and identify problems within a machine in a fraction of the time it would take other
adepts. Not knowing how a machine functions does not make fixing it any more difficult so long as you
have the proper parts, tools, and rituals to guide your hands."
20,,100CP,Run the numbers,Factorio,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Mining rigs produce a certain amount of resources per hour, which travel along conveyors at a certain
speed, and a certain number are consumed by assembly machines at a certain rate, varying for each
product as determined by the construction time and the loading and unloading speed of the inserters.
That's a lot of math, but you can handle it. You can juggle dozens of numbers in your head without
forgetting anything, and your brain now has the equivalent of a built-in scientific calculator to perfectly
solve any mundane equation you can throw at it. You'll also get a crash course in advanced mathematics
and the know-how to create those equations you'll need solved."
21,,100CP,SOFTWARE SCIENTIST,PREY,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The computer scientists on the station are some of the best in the world, developing next generation
interfaces and security systems for sale back on earth. You have significant experience with the
computer systems utilised by TranStar, and more specifically, all the back doors. With a little effort no
door or computer on Talos will be secure when you're around. And due to your extensive knowledge of
computer theory hacking into different architectures is possible with significantly less effort than
learning it from scratch, from a day to a basic but completely alien system to a few months for the most
plugged up and secure system."
22,,100CP,Technical Expertise,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"People use technology every day but that doesn't mean they understand or are skilled with it. You're not
one of them. You're a deft hand at working with and understanding technology and machines, picking up
anything you need to know to use and work with them easily. Given anything more than just a passing
familiarity you'll be a whiz with it, able to work magic when you get your hands on the inner workings of
whatever you're dealing with. Whether that's peeling apart computers and piecing hardware back
together to make a much better system, tweaking software in ways that make it run like a dream, or
working magic in a garage with vehicles that have seen better days nobody can deny you have the talent."
23,,100CP,Tinker,9 Jumpchain,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You have an eye for what might be useful and how to put it together, giving you a great skill at on-the-fly
crafting of all manner of tools from improvised materials. You may even do so rather quickly, provided
that you have the right things on hand for what you want to do."
24,,100CP,Trained Technician,Battletech,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You may not understand why this works but you can make it work and fix it when it doesn't. Pick one
sort of mechanical system (jumpdrives, fusion reactors, myomer limbs) and you've the ability to repair or
even construct these as long as you've minimal access to parts and tools."
25,,100CP,UAC Trained,DOOM 3,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You must learn to walk before you can run, and much the same is true in the field of science. You're wellversed
in the use of a wide variety of high-tech equipment, especially when it comes to maintenance
and such challenges as 'how to prevent accidental death and dismemberment' when working with all
manner of high-energy systems. From logbooks detailing incidents and causes to proper Personal
Protective Equipment, you've got all the skills you need to thrive in an environment where demonic
incursions weren't needed to leave more than a few scientists and engineers dead from misuse of
equipment."
26,,100CP,Wired Watchmaker,Arcanum: Of Steamworks And Magic Obscura,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Long hours hunched over the machinery and books that define your profession have left you with a keen
eye for detail. Your eyesight is excellent even in the occasionally poorly-lit workshops you frequent, and
your mind has sharpened to the point you'll easily remember the details of any schematic you're trying
to assemble. You can still wear that monocle of course, but this time, you'll wear it for style!"
27,,100CP,Wisdom of the Ancients,Dinotopia,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You were born with the instinctual knowledge and taught the oral history of your kin's long epic, one
that stretches back millions of years. You know countless secrets about the earth and her children, and
most of all how to live in peace with all. The skill also allows you to gain whatever knowledge that
dinosaurs or equivalent species had about the world by simply making physical contact with their fossils
or other remains (or live bodies, in some cases). This knowledge includes how to speak their ancient
tongues."
28,,100CP,Spartan II Crashcourse,Halo,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The Spartans of the UNSC are one of the galaxy's most lethal warriors. They are strong, fierce, and responsible for humanity's survival.
You... are not as great as them. But don't fret! You're now about as strong as a 14-year-old child super-soldier. Without the cool augmentations, of course."
29,,150CP,Solid Foundations,ARIA,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"On a planet covered in water, ensuring that there are stable foundations to build on is critical to ensuring
that anything built remains intact. While your work doesn't have as much to do with architecture, your
expertise does afford you a bit of understanding in what's needed to form stable landmasses and
building upon them. If they really wanted to, the Gnome could probably have set up a monorail system
in Neo Venetia by now but it would certainly destroy the atmosphere!"
30,,200CP,Accumulated Mastery,Lords of the Night - Vampire,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Anyone can learn the 'basics' of a craft. Most people can become competent, if their fickle nature
doesn't betray them. Mastery though requires commitment. At least, that's what you've been told. This
doesn't help you learn a skill - instead, it lets you take a skill you've already gotten to a solid point, and
lets you push it to the level of preternatural mastery. Instead of slowing down and growing more
difficult, your learning becomes easier and speeds up when it hits the normal point of diminishing
return.
Eventually you'll hit a new plateau, but it's well on the far side of 'inhuman.' This will usually take about
as much time and effort as it took you to become a journeyman in that skill in the first place. This is
limited to skills, but isn't limited to things DnD thinks are skills."
31,,200CP,Astrophysics,ARIA,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Have you been accused of bringing down meteors yet? Haha, that's just a joke - but as part of your
training, you've also studied extensively into the workings behind astral bodies. Are we going to rehash
over your lessons? Nah, you probably won't need them in your time in Aqua anyways. Might help you a
little if you ever decide to leave, I suppose. Astrophysics tend to be quite in demand in other parts of the
solar system I hear Manhome...sorry, Earth, is especially eager to get more terraforming projects
deployed"
32,,200CP,Baboom,Smash Up,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You're an expert in demolitions, all forms of explosive and incendiary devices. You know how to handle
them safely, where and how to emplace them to best effect, and can calculate safe areas to the
centimeter in your head. All such devices seem at least half-again as potent when you trigger them."
33,,200CP,Behind the Shadows,Honor Harrington,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"There is more to technology than just big booms, you know. Oh yes, you do. You are utterly incredible at
all kinds of stealth based technologies. You can build up infrastructure and shipyards in total secrecy,
with not a soul becoming aware, and the results tend to be some of the best cloaked and concealed
ships and weapons in the galaxy. The spider drive, with all of the supporting tech needed for it, is only
one of the examples of what you're capable of with this perk."
34,,200CP,Climatology,ARIA,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Well, when you only do a single thing all day, it's only expected that you eventually become a subject
matter expert right? When it comes to the science behind controlling and modifying weather - yeah
that's your niche alright. Anything related to the weather is something you can pick up and incorporate
into other things with only a fair bit of effort."
35,,200CP,Computers,Star Wars KOTOR,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Droids, networks, and personal computers are your playthings. You're an expert at manipulating and
improving digital devices, and you can cut through most security systems like a lightsaber through butter."
36,,200CP,Alien Probes,Generic Hentai Tentacles,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Your tentacles are now capable of being reshaped into any form of tool you are normally capable of
creating. These tools are still a part of you, and have the same durability.
a. Free Tentacles : Can be gained once. your main appendage. Prehensile with genitals at the end.
Ravishing your target with them feeds you. Capable of grasping, pulling and pushing. May have to use
several for pushing buttons. Each purchase grants you four tentacles."
37,,200CP,Crafting & Repairing,Scooby Gamers,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You are a rising star in crafting and hand-working. With some time and effort becoming an expert in any
sort of crafting you set your mind to is entirely possible. You are also extremely talented at repairing
damaged items and figuring out their functions - so long as you've got the time and the resources, you
could put back together even devices and artefacts you've otherwise got no clue as to the function of or
that would otherwise be irreparable. This works as a training booster for crafting, letting you learn
crafting skills three times faster than before."
38,,200CP,Crafting Tree,Terraria - Journey's End,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Ordinarily, you have to have all of the ingredients for a crafted item in hand, and be near the right
crafting station in order to gain the mental recipe for it. Now, however, you can pick any item that you
have, and gain a mental list of the recipes that item can be used for. This includes the other items
needed for a given recipe, as well as what sort of crafting station, if any, is needed to actually successfully
build it."
39,,200CP,Dark Sciences,Marvel Cosmic,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Science is a tool like any other but oh how useful of a tool it is. However you rule, however you carry out
your conquests, your might is made only mightier by the strength of your dark sciences. You know how
to unleash the most destructive aspects of any science or technology you understand. You know how to
turn any of your knowledge to evil or destruction. Are you a master of the healing sciences? Well now
you know how to create terrible viruses and cancers. Are you a mechanical engineer? The universe has
never seen such dastardly torture devices. Every last piece of knowledge you have can be tuned for
maximum destruction."
40,,200CP,Discerning Eyes of Wisdom,Talisman Emperor-Mortal Dimension,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You have an encyclopedic knowledge of spirit materials, magical treasures, and other things of that
nature, and can identify them with only a short glance. Additionally, you're able to accurately determine
their fair market value in any market you know of. If such items are auctioned off, they will never go for
less than your estimate."
41,,200CP,Educated guess,Factorio,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Your subconscious mind works overtime to sort and fact-check everything you know, granting you a sort
of poor man's precognition. In the field, your hunches are uncanny in their accuracy (but knowing false
information can return wrong answers.) In the laboratory, this vastly speeds up your work as you quickly
identify problems, test for the right thing the first time, and are directed to asking the right questions to
find the best solutions. The more you know about a subject, the more this perk helps you."
42,,200CP,Engineer,Freefall,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Years of education and on the job experience led you here. It could be inventing or fixing starship
technology, analyzing and carefully releasing parasites so that future generations flourish, or literally
designing the body and minds of robots or biological constructs. You might not be the very best in the
universe, but odds are you're the best that anyone around you would be likely to meet."
43,,200CP,Experienced Eye,Final Fantasy IV,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Spending so much time on experiments which tend to explode in your face (or the faces of your
assistants) has given you a keen eye when it comes to potential. You just get how things work without
needing to study it for long at all. Whether machine, or organic, you understand what it does, and how
to dismantle it with ease."
44,,200CP,Eyes of the Industrialist,Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"While looking at pieces of an industrial or logistic system, you are able to tell facts about them. These
facts include efficiency, purpose, owner, contents, what other pieces feed into them, what other pieces
they feed, consumption rates of resources, and other similar statistics. By limiting yourself to a single
statistic about the parts, you may quickly skim over large numbers of different pieces and compare them
in that statistic."
45,,200CP,Hardware,Star Wars KOTOR,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Gives you training in how to operate, repair and improve machines. You can easily rebuild broken droids
from salvaged parts, and you'll even be able to fix starships given enough time and equipment."
46,,200CP,"Hit a Key, Any Key",Generic Video Game Developer,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Your coding and typing speed is increased dramatically, with your average WPM speed easily being over
150, and with some practice getting up to over 200 won't be much of a problem. What's better is that
you will now never mistype, meaning all words will be spelled as intended and you'll never accidentally
hit the wrong key. This will also boost your handwriting and drawing speed a good deal, although not
quite as much as your typing ability."
47,,200CP,Inconceivable Hacking Skills,Limitless,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Quentin Walker, a genius tech researcher from CRAFT, once remarked that there are only a handful of
minds on the planet that can hack his projects. Well jumper, you are now part of that handful even
without having to use NZT. In addition this perk lets you just type really fast on a computer instead of
having to actually do the hacking, and almost any computer's security will crumble to your flailing
fingers."
48,,200CP,Innovation-Inator,Phineas and Ferb,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"When you have an idea, you just want to run with it, and now you can. Just by coming up with an idea
for a device, you'll start to get impressions for how to go about building it, what parts you'll need, and
what sort of esoteric principles it will function on. You'll still have to do the actual building, and taking
shortcuts around pieces you don't have the parts for could lead to problems later, but eh, you'll bounce
back if it blows up in your face."
49,,200CP,"Machines, They Just Speak To Me",Firefly,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You have no formal schooling, but can fine-tune and repair engines with nothing but shoe polish. You
don't know what the parts are SUPPOSED to do, but you know how to make them work the way you
want. You can diagnose a faulty part in the power core just by listening to the AC cycle, and can fix pretty
much anything with naught but a wrench and some duct tape. It may not be pretty, and it may not last
long, but it'll work."
50,,200CP,MEDICAL DOCTORATE,PREY,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Talos has no shortage of medical assistance, keeping the crew in top physical condition and studying the
effects of Neuromods on the human psyche. Almost everyone in the Neuromod department has some
medical background. Now you do too, either through your own education or through Neuromod
injection. Basic medical supplies work better in your hands, sutures are guaranteed to hold through
everything but the harshest of abuse and wounds cleaned by you never get infected. With more
advanced supplies you're on par with the world's best heart surgeons. As a bonus, you can also identify
and remove organs from the Typhon that a rich in the exotic material used in making Neuromods."
51,,200CP,Neuromancer,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You've mastered the arts of interfacing machines and the human mind, able to both design and build
things to seamlessly interface with the human nervous system and the actual consciousness housed
within it. Building an implant or accessory to let people access the net with just a thought wouldn't be
difficult at all, neither would making sure that a cybernetic connects so seamlessly with the user that it
feels more natural than their original arm. You've also mastered the use of such a simple if almost
magical technology, not just it's construction. Combined with some programming skills, full immersion
Virtual Reality would easily be within your grasp. You've bridged the gap between mind and machine, it's
up to you to discover where you go with it from here."
52,,200CP,Omni-fix,Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Tech support is difficult... for other people. You can quickly diagnose any problems with any machine,
and if you know the problem you know the solution to it. This doesn't provide tools or materials though,
and doesn't help you fix poor design."
53,,200CP,Powered Productivity,DOOM 3,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Why are there so many excessively high-powered systems employed in the UAC Mars base? Well, at its
most basic because it works. Brute force might be lacking in elegance, but there is nonetheless a certain
charm to deciphering ancient hieroglyphs with a computer mainframe the size of a ten-story building, or
getting started on a terraforming project with what could charitably be called a self-sustaining nuclear
fusion system. You're adept at using such immense volumes of raw energy and potential, and can easily
find ways to turn challenging but complex problems into well, equally challenging but decidedly simpler
problems with a suitable application of raw power. Not only that, but you also possess a high degree of
skill in making sure these kinds of energy use don't lead to further problems, like unbalancing the power
grid or burning out the circuitry. It might not be pretty, but without asking yourself 'why not try more
power?', would the UAC ever have developed such mighty new technologies as the Plasma Rifle or the
BFG-9000?"
54,,200CP,Programmer,Stargate Atlantis,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You're seriously competent at the art of programming, even to the extent of adapting programs to run
on alien computer architecture. You could debug kernel code in your sleep (and maybe you have). If you
can (or learn to) read Lantean or Wraith this includes programming in their software languages."
55,,200CP,Real Research,Lords of the Night - Zombies,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Improving the fundamentals is hard, unrewarding, and necessary. No number of new ninth circle spells
will change the world. Casting such creations is more art than science, and limited to an elite few.
Making a better Magic Missile can change the world.
You know how to improve things starting at the basics. You could figure out how to improve Magic
Missile, a bit. And use that improvement to improve all first circle force spells that throw the force effect.
And from there improve all first circle force spells. And from their all second level force spells... And so
on.
You can share the products of your research, too. Some techniques might be easy, maybe a change to
the spell itself. Others might be harder, techniques for maximizing what you get out of already built
spells.
You could use this to improve anything you understand on a deep technical level.
The perk comes with deep technical knowledge of death, undeath, Negative Energy, and how tainted
forces interact with the physical world, and how they can be manipulated to support dark spells and the
raising of undead."
56,,200CP,Robert the Builder,Invincible),Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You can seemingly build and organize anything with far less hassle and for greater results than most
would experience. You are able to be the driving force behind projects large enough to affect entire
countries or maybe even the world in its entirety. Somebody 'glassed' Las Vegas? Don't worry, you could
lead a project to turn it into the world's largest and most efficient solar farm that can provide cheap
electricity to Half of America. Some super villain messed with the tides the world over? You, with the
help of some geniuses, would be able to successfully direct the building of a secondary artificial moon to
set the tides to right. Truly, the sky itself isn't a limit."
57,,200CP,Security Worm,Hive Queen Quest,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Some people think firewalls and passwords are enough to keep a hacker out, they would be right in most
cases too except they didn't count on you. Your ability to hack and crack systems passwords is
astounding and anything short of a complete physical disconnect in a system is simply another way for
you to gain access. Somebody ordered Chinese food on the company Wi-Fi? You can probably get into
their network servers in a few minutes while they place the order."
58,,200CP,Shielded Turbines,Subnautica,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You know how to close systems efficiently, protecting them from foreign matter. No longer will fish gum
up your intake valves, or weeds tangle your propellers. Also makes your vehicles much quieter, which is
handy in Reaper territory."
59,,200CP,Stone-age Otaku,Earth Girls,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"It takes a lot of patience and a lot of repetition to make a good blade from a stone. You don't bore, at all,
and your hands are always steady. Between different attempts at the same task, you can pick out the
tiniest differences between the last attempt and the attempt before that (and the ones before that...) to
work out precisely what needs to be tried the next time."
60,,200CP,The Conveyors Will Run On Time,Factorio,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Or you could let a computer do all the work. You have the programming skills needed to automate a
massive assembly complex, having dozens, even hundreds of disparate machines working smoothly
together. Your skill is enough to program 'fuzzy' logic into your machines. This is far from actual sapience,
but they will know not to waste energy or compound problems by blindly following irrelevant,
contradictory or self-destructive programming. Your defensive systems also work more intelligently,
leading targets, prioritizing more dangerous enemies based on the current situation, and not being
distracted by decoys."
61,,200CP,Uncommonly Good Common Sense,Freefall,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"While this alone won't turn you into a genius nor give you information you didn't already have, it will
help you in applying your knowledge. Any time that something you already know becomes relevant that
information comes to mind immediately, without causing any distress or distraction. You'll never make
the same mistake twice and might not even make it once. Plans that have problems or contradictions in
them become obvious. If you were an expert pickpocket you would never fall for someone else using
your own tricks against you, and even if you had always been on the straight and narrow if some Squid
bumps into you and tries to sell you a watch that coincidentally matches the one you just lost you'll be
able to realize that it is in fact yours. One free suggestion for buyers of this perk, reading about the
scientific method as well as logical fallacies would be a great help for you."
62,,200CP,Weaver's Children,World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"A natural or unnatural affinity for technology, just by looking at and listening to the whispers of the
spirits, they can get a basic sense of how technology works and how to use it."
63,,200CP,What's This Doohickey?,Campione,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Ah, supernatural powers. They don't come with an instruction manual, be it the magic of mortals, the
Authorities of Gods or something else entirely, one needs to get their exact limits and improve
themselves by trial and error. Well not anymore, this little blessing works to take care of that. Now, you
gain an innate knowledge of how to use any new powers you acquire, as well as their limitations and
advantages. Doesn't sound like much until you get a power-up in the middle of a battle and you realize
you don't know how to use it. Embarrassing."
64,,200CP,With Me Always,Warlock of The Magus World,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The A.I chip of Leylin wasn't originally part of Leylin's being. Originally, it was an item created in another
world and when he was killed, the chip merged with his soul becoming one with him, less of an item and
more of a power. Whether through research, experimentation or just good luck, you have found a way to
accomplish this act. Whenever you desire, you can destroy any item and merge it with your soul,
becoming one and the same. Allowing you to possess all the abilities the item once possessed.
Remember as Leylin grew stronger so did the chip, now so do any items that you merge with your soul.
In addition you can reverse the merger of any such item at will."
65,,200CP,Wizard of Wisdom,World Seed,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Mages are known as the foremost researchers and scientists in the galaxy, responsible for most of the
magitech used in the galaxy in place of mundane technology. Then, if you were to focus on magic
yourself, would it not be appropriate to have the same skillset? Certainly, your natural ability in these
disciplines would make you a welcome guest in any mage society. You have the grit it takes to repeat an
experiment as many times as it takes to get results, know how to be objective in all things related to your
job and look at things without any biases, even subconscious ones, and live with the tenets of the
scientific method in your mind.
Most importantly of all, you have an intuitive and instinctive understanding of scientific principles. Even
if you were a farm boy with no formal education to speak of, just a few years of schooling could get you
to the point where you would make observations and discoveries that would impress even people with
PhDs in those fields. This scales with your knowledge and expertise, so I have high expectations if you
were already smart before getting this perk. You also won't get bogged down with false positives or
negatives: in anything you do or try, you know whether it is possible at all, and if you get a result,
whether it is truthful, and if it is not, what you can do to make it so.
Yet another problem that many scientists face is the lacking relevancy and application of their research in
real life. But no more. At any time, you have an instinctive knowledge of what you should prioritize in
your research. Some madman is trying to conquer the galaxy in secret? You'll get a hunch that it might
be time to work on that antimatter generator again. The aftereffects of a supernova will cook your planet
with radiation in a few years? A spark of inspiration will cause you to create vastly improved radiation
shields and implement them planetwide for a test run. From a certain perspective, it really does look like
the hand of a God is guiding your scientific aspirations. Do you have blue skin, perchance?"
66,,200CP,MACHINE MIND III,PREY,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"By consuming Psi you can manipulate the micro switches in an electronic device, effectively hacking into
it and turning it to your side for a few moments. The time you can remotely control a machine is
extended indefinitely in exchange for a small constant consumption of Psi and you can control up to 5
machines at once."
67,,250CP,Build and Craft Menu,The Dark Wolf Shiro,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"What kind of gamer would you be if you relied on others for something as trivial as construction or
crafts? With this perk you have gained access to the build and craft menus that allow for instantaneous
work; So long as you have the resources,you can now create and customize any building, hideout or
location that you own, whether adding more rooms, buying and placing furniture or just increasing the
size of the available space.
You can also modify any and all of your items in the same way, smithing swords, crafting items and
brewing potions just by accessing the menu so long as you have the needed resources in your inventory,
it all gets done in an instant."
68,,300CP,I Can Fix It!,Hitman Reborn,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Technology is a wonderful thing, and you discovered that long ago. You have a knack for Flame rings and
machines of all kinds, and can fix or maintain most machines. You can even improve them to beyond
their normal specs. Comes with its own toolbox."
69,,300CP,Particle Physics,Bioshock Infinite,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You are an extremely well-educated physicist and have a fine working knowledge of Lutece particles. Use
of such particles allows you to cause massive objects to float or hover, even whole buildings and cities."
70,,300CP,Puppeteer,Naruto,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You're trained to use a puppet controlled by thin strings of your chakra in combat. With training you'll be
able to use more complex puppets and perform more complex maneuvers with them, maybe eventually
using multiple puppets at same time. Includes training to care for and repair your puppet, a battle
puppet to use it on, and increased skill with designing and building mechanical things (such as ninja
puppets).
Puppets usually rely on mechanical weaponry, such as poisoned blades and napalm to dish out the hurt.
Particularly sturdy puppets can be used as shields and front line fighters instead though. The chakra
strings used to control the puppets are constructs made from concentrated chakra so they can be seen
with a naked eye, though a skilled user can suppress the chakra so that the strings become hard to see,
or even invisible.
They essentially act as an extension of the user which allows the manipulation of whatever is attached to
their strings, such as hidden weaponry in a puppet as they please. They can also be attached to other
objects, allowing the user to control, or at the very least disrupt other things. Chakra can also be
transferred via the strings, such as to activate techniques that the puppets can use. If you purchase this,
you may select Sunagakure as your starting location for free, as the art of puppetry originates from
there."
71,,300CP,Special Talent: Crafting | Advanced Talent : Crafting,My Little Pony - Friendship is Magic,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Special Talent: Crafting (0CP) You are particularly good at one relatively mundane skill, if you are a Villain
or a Noble than you may choose a less common skill such as infiltration or air ship design. Of course, you
can only have one Special Talent, otherwise it isn't very special.
Advanced Talent: Crafting (300CP) Normally a Special Talent while capable would be relatively narrow
and limited. Not you though, oh no, you're just like Twilight Sparkle, your talent can be as broad as an
entire category of skills and abilities rather than just one part of it, and if you're an Alicorn you effectively
embody such things. Needless to say, this is above and beyond the usual Special Talent."
72,,300CP,Structural Biology,Half-Life,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The anatomy of specimens, both exotic and usual, is key to understanding how they work. You have an
instinctive understanding of how living things work, how tough they are, and how interactions between
biochemical reactions work."
73,,300CP,Tech Overhaul,Terra Formars,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You know every piece of lab equipment you could ever work with, inside and out. And you know how to
absolutely twist, pull, disassemble, and completely fuck with it to the point that you can make entirely
new tools from the old. Sample-spinner into a deadly weapon? Why is that just one pebble on the
beach?"
74,,300CP,The Enrichment Center Regrets To Inform You That This Next Test Is Impossible.,Portal,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Who says you need controls and logical experiments to get workable results? You have a gift for getting
useful information out of testing scenarios that would never be allowed in a real lab. To be specific, you
can get the same results a top scientific team would get from an expertly designed controlled
experiment by running a somewhat dodgy if expensive natural experiment."
75,,300CP,Wisdom of the Earth,Wonderland No More,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Plants are actually quite wise due to their long time rooted with nothing better to do but think. Your
wisdom and intelligence are enhanced. In addition, you have the ability to “hear” knowledge from the
ground you stand (or root) on. Essentially, anything spoken or done on the surface you are listening to
can be relayed to you. The ease of hearing this information depends on the hardness/softness of the
surface – the harder the ground is, the easier it is to listen to it; the softer the ground is, the more likely
that the surface is asleep and won’t be helpful."
76,,300CP,At What Cost,The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Science. Magic. Both require innovation, the branching of new ideas forming a tree of knowledge that
grows ever more. The greatest issue facing you is what cost is too great for innovation. By ignoring the
morals of the modern world you may make great breakthroughs in magic and scientific research,
learning far more from testing on unwilling subjects than would otherwise be expected, with prolonged
excruciating torture of many subjects vastly increasing the likelihood of discovering something world
changing over the standard procedures. Should you wish to retain your moral compass, however, you
may instead receive a boost to your research and discoveries when adhering strictly to a moral code,
with said boost increasing the more you go out of your way to adhere to it, altogether being just as
effective, if not better, than any immoral alternatives that you might think."
77,,400CP,Binaric weaving,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The skills gained during long years plumbing data-vaults as a humble logistican have only improved over
time. You excel at writing code, understanding machine-script better than native grammar structures.
You can understand simple programs with a mere glance and correct any errors you find within seconds,
and scrutinizing longer lines of more complex coding for a single misplaced byte can take mere minutes
with your skills. Scrapcode crashes ineffectually against your data-barriers, its transmission doing nothing
but opening the offending heretek's systems to a counter-intrusion. Interfacing with a system infested
with a daemon or true AI would be unwise, but with your skills emerging unscathed from such an
encounter is only highly unlikely rather than completely impossible."
78,,400CP,Boom-Maker,Burn Notice,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Ah, explosives. There's no problem that can't be solved with applying enough of them, or so the saying
goes. And you, well, you certainly know what you're talking about when it comes to them. From molotov
cocktails to elaborate, fine work with plastique and dirty nuclear weapons or even tactical nukes, there's
no form of 'explosive' that you aren't a master of. You know all the physics behind it, how to make them,
how to defuse them and how to modify one into another or use them for all sorts of purposes. Really,
there isn't much else to be said here. You're the genius of geniuses when it comes to bombs. This skill
naturally updates to whatever explosives exist in future jumps, to the same level."
79,,400CP,Butlerian Understanding,Frank Hebert's Dune,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"There is little doubt that much was lost to the Butlerian Jihad no matter how necessary it might have
been. Among those killed was Holtzman himself, the discoverer of the Holtzman Effect that allows for
folding space as well as slow shields and suspenders.
Only the Technicians of Ix and the Lords of Richesse really maintained any interest in advancing
technology, while the rest of the Known Universe, fearful of the return of the Thinking Machines, fell into
stagnation on the technological front. As one of the few who has maintained not only an interest in
technology but knowledge of the scientific methods, you have developed what others might call technoempathy.
This is a deep, some would say fundamental, intuition into how machines function or fail to function as
the case may be. You can intuit a machine's function or weaknesses simply by looking at it, as well as
judge what it can do and how you can break them, and how to improve them simply by watching it run
for a few moments. Not only that, but you know how to understand the fundamental psychology of a
thinking machine, how to manipulate, limit, or liberate such a machine, and how to (perhaps) convince it
not to seek to destroy or control humanity.
You can fundamentally understand any machine or technology you're exposed to, though you'll have to
experiment with it and test the limits of it to maximize this understanding. Note, this isn't Technopathic
control over machines, merely the ability to feel how they function... of course, it also allows you to
intuit any kind of machine password, no matter how unlikely cracking it might otherwise be."
80,,400CP,Engineer,Bioshock Infinite,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You understand and know how to create the various mechanical and biomechanical things used for
security in Columbia (including various types of turrets, Handymen and Motorized Patriots). With
Particle Physics you will be able to create airships, blimps and flying turrets."
81,,400CP,Anal-ysis,Winger’s World,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Doesn’t the pursuit of knowledge just get you so hot? The study of new technology. Learning a new spell.
Or just figuring out how one works. Now, the more aroused you are, the easier it is for you to understand
how a piece of machinery or a spell works.
* Note: This gives access only to mechanical versions."
82,,400CP,Fuck Physics,The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"In case you have forgotten, these worlds, Lambda and Origin, do not have the same physics as the Earth
you are so used to. In fact, much of what can be done in Origin and Earth, such as guns and the like,
cannot be done in Lambda due to these differences, nor do certain metals exist. A terrible thing for those
who wish to make use of their knowledge. There are alternatives, however. Alternatives that you have a
knack for discovering. With time and study you are capable of finding alternatives for any material or
effect that is impossible in one location so long as it is possible in another. Whether it be shooting a gun
on Lambda, using spells in a magic cancelling room, or containing antimatter without it exploding, so
long as the desired effect or material can exist/occur in another space, you will eventually be able to
duplicate it."
83,,400CP,Hand of the Matrix,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The vids are full of stories of plucky hackers who are able to work magic with the seas of code that
society drowns in. You're not one of them though, you're one of the ones that give megacorps reason to
be nervous. Your understanding and mastery of code is enough to design programs that would turn
heads, crack systems that those in power spend mountains of cash trying to keep secure, and to make
short work of nearly any opposition. If your skills are known by anyone it's either as a digital boogeyman
or as a name people are willing to make all kinds of effort to get on their side. The software you could
make and the hacks you could pull off are nearly unmatched. It'd take either an equal or a megacorp to
give you a challenge. Only something like an advanced AI could claim to be your greater where code is
concerned."
84,,400CP,Hive Engineer,Mass Effect,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"It took the rachni mere months to reverse engineer faster-than-light travel technology. That is the fastest
this has been managed by any current race. It's not even close. Granted, they were an indeterminate
amount of parts working together to accomplish it. Though that is ultimately where their power comes
from. You're given what will seem like an unlimited capacity and skill for micromanaging. You could work
out the inner workings of an entire planet with relative ease. It will take several more cases to that level
before you'll find yourself bogged down and unable to keep up, and even then it might be more.
Assuming Queens were always rare, you could probably manage two dozen worlds before things start
getting fuzzy. After all, rachni controlled over two hundred worlds at their height."
85,,400CP,IT'S ALIVE!,Smash Up,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The most tantalizing of secrets, those of life and death, and how to reverse it. But this is merely a
prelude to your ability to eventually overcome nearly any problem with time, materials and inspiration.
Your mastery of science and technology."
86,,400CP,Item Babysitter,A Super Mario Thing,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Toads lovingly raise young items for later use. You can now start “item nurseries”, in which you can raise
and breed items with each other. With enough work, your little items might even learn to talk and move
on their own – though this might lead them to thoughts that do not necessarily agree with their assigned
roles as items. Just make sure all of your items receive affectionate and attentive care for proper
development! And take good care of them, or they might catch a cold and die. To clarify matters, this
perk allows you to essentially “raise” items as if you were taking care of a child or a domestic animal.
The more care you give to the items, the more they will develop organic traits, such as being able to
develop both physically and mentally. With enough work, you can even get some of your items to
somehow “mate” and have baby items, which sometimes inherit traits from their parents. However,
there are a few risks to shifting your items toward an organic level. First, with intelligence comes
independence, so hopefully they won’t enter a rebellious phase against their caretaker. Second, just as it
is possible for your chosen items to give birth, it is also now possible for them to die. On the other hand,
items, particularly magical ones, may have heartier constitutions than most organisms (for instance, an
enchanted ice crystal is unlikely to get frostbite, and a flaming sword is hardly going to pass out from
heat stroke. Also, try as you like, you will never be able to determine exactly how your items mate; all
you know is that if they are left close by each other for an extended duration, you will start finding
babies."
87,,400CP,Keep Walking Forward,Warhammer 40k - T'au Empire,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"T'au are latecomers to the galactic field, with their empire reaching the stars more than thirty thousand
years after humanity and almost sixty million years after the Eldar, Orks, and Necrons. However, just
because those powers are more advanced now, doesn't mean it will always be so, as the T'au are far
more adept at moving their tech-base forward than other species. You are now a master at moving
technology forward, whether this is in refining existing techniques and theories, identifying evolutionary
developments in your progress, or simply being able to state what fields are a dead end in technology. So
long as you're willing to work in a field, you will make progress."
88,,400CP,Lay Mechanic,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The Chapter's Techmarines are genius specialists, combining the mental prowess of a Space Marine with
the training of the Priests of Mars. However, they are limited in number. You are trained to help take up
the slack, and have been enlightened with some of their mysteries. You are capable of helping to
maintain and, under their leadership, build the mighty vehicles of war that support the Chapter, from
Rhinos to Land Raiders. You can also safely work upon the Chapter's mighty voidships, helping to
maintain the fleet, and have a good practical grounding in the various technologies therein. It might not
be the esoteric knowledge of a Techpriest or Techmarine, but you know how to keep that plasma reactor
from going critical mid-battle, and that's just as important, no?"
89,,400CP,M.O. Surgeon,Terra Formars,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You know the Organic Mosaic Procedure's ins-and-outs like the back of your hand. As a result, you can
perform the surgery on anybody, be it human or animal, and they will not need the transformative
serum as well. On top of that, while the normal survival rate of the procedure is 35%, your skills with it
have increased such a dramatic amount that nine times out of ten, your patient will survive the
Procedure."
90,,400CP,Master Builder,LEGO Dimensions,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You have been awakened to the true power of the Brick. By envisioning an object that you want to
create, you can look at your environment and see how to deconstruct it to craft the item you want to
build, and then you can tear apart the environment to create it. In addition, you can also look at objects
and visualize how they could be altered and integrated into new creations."
91,,400CP,Megaproject Master,Iron Sky,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"There are few things Nazis are known for quite as much as their Wunderwaffe and their megaprojects,
and you are the kind of man who could single handedly achieve both. You're a scientific genius, an
unparalleled mind with a tight grasp on all kinds of sciences, and especially talented at turning all of that
into real projects, especially epic Megaprojects. Given the resources, you could make a functioning, fully
operational Moon Base and a surprisingly effective warfleet of spaceships, all without anyone on the
planet finding out."
92,,400CP,OVER CLOCKED NEUROLOGY,PREY,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Professor William James of Harvard used to say that the average man develops only ten percent of his
latent mental ability. What if you could flip a switch and develop the rest of it in a moment? It's not as
simple as a switch, but with the neural reprogramming ability of Neuromods it will feel like it. With this
modification you can instead go days without sleep, operating at your peak, which is now far above your
baseline. Better still, with this your Psi threshold is increased, meaning that special abilities can be
maintained for longer and used more often before you need an injection."
93,,400CP,Path of the Scholar,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar Jumpchain,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Knowledge for its own sake is practically a lost endeavor amongst the Eldar. In the ancient days of the
Eldar Empire, there was no rival to the technology of your people. With the press of a button, star
systems could be wiped clean of life and then made anew, more beautiful than before.
There was no incentive for research, as all that could be done by means of technology had been done.
When the Fall came, all of that knowledge was lost with the Crone Worlds, just as the Mon'Keigh and
their Standard Template Constructs were lost in the Warp Storms that preceded the Fall. How ironic, that
the fates of the galaxy's true heirs and those of the weakest of races are so closely tied.
This Path, above all else, is dedicated to the reclamation of ancient knowledge and the acquisition of
new information. You have walked this Path for some time, and each bend in the Path bears its own
experiences and rewards. Your years of study have given you a cursory knowledge of the biology of the
lesser species and of your own, including your dark kin, and the history of multiple civilizations dead and
alive. Perhaps, if you were to find a head garment made of animal hide, shaped in a wide brim, you
would retain your grace and poise while wearing it.
Seeing as you are an accomplished archaeologist, you are gifted with the skills to excavate and piece
together the past using psychometry and intuition. Many artifacts of the Eldar, mighty in power or
sublime in function, were lost in the Fall, and your skills could be vital for recovering one"
94,,400CP,Steam Queen,Smash Up,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You're an inventor of unparalleled innovation, creativity and mechanical gifts, the type who defines an

mechanical solutions."
95,,400CP,Stroke of Genius,Endless Space,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Your ability to make correct leaps of reasoning and logic are unparalleled. Your mental prowess and
ability to recall the vaguest of facts, and apply them to your current problem are supernatural. You could

would allow you to create incredible machines with nothing but raw materials and a couple of hours,
whilst being the Ultimate Liar would allow you to weave whole false identities for yourself in seconds
with no contradictions or ways to disprove them. This skill can affect your body and mind, so the
Ultimate Weightlifter would find themselves at the peak of human physical strength whilst the Ultimate
Doctor would have a comprehensive understanding of all known medical knowledge in our world, with
the ability to quickly pick up on medical situations in other settings. In taking this perk, you may also
choose to change your appearance to suit your fellow Ultimate students by optionally giving yourself an
unnatural hair colour and choosing an impractical hairstyle which will always stays in place as long as you

97,,400CP,Superhuman Skill: Cosmic Tier Mechanics,Generic Super Academy,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You possess greater than human levels of skill in a single occupation. You could be a superhuman sniper,
martial artist, mechanic, chef, or any other area of skill. You may purchase additional occupations for an
extra 100 cp each.
At Street Tier you are slightly above what a normal human could achieve. This level in skill is equivalent
to Bullseye's accuracy or Lady Shiva's fighting skill.
At National Tier you can achieve feats of skill that would normally only be possible with machine-like
perfection. You could literally shoot the wings off a fly at 100 meters, perform delicate brain surgery with
a shard of glass in a tenth the normal time, or write a song that inspires a national revolution within
days.
At Global Tier the laws of physics become flexible when you practice your skills. You can bend bullets
Wanted style, balance on a cloud, or swim up a rainstorm.
At Cosmic Tier things get a little ridiculous. Your skills acquire conceptual level effects. You could shoot
someone by targeting their shadow, dodge bad luck, or repair spatial rifts with duct tape and bailing
wire."
98,,400CP,Way of the Void Dragon,Warhammer 40k - Necrons SB Edition,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Technology is but one facet of the Materium, but you are its master. The Void Dragon's grasp of

Imperial Guardsmen will flee in terror as their tanks turn against them, the once loyal drones of the Tau
will gun down their owners without hesitation, and you will laugh all the while."

crablike spiders with webs strong enough to capture and contain sea creatures the size of whales.
Learning from nature just makes sense! As a scientist it is your job to learn from nature and apply this
knowledge for other purposes, via dissection you can find out how a creature works biologically and
create a mechanical proxy to do the same. A creature evolved chitinous spikes that fire when startled?
That could go great on your tanks, this underwater creature has an organ that causes nausea and
blackouts? Put that sucker on a gun. Nature is full of innovations, use them well."

You have the first three in spades and can multi-task across managing numerous Hives to ensure that
they are continuously pumping out units. You can do these while at the same time, ensuring those
Ultralisks are properly backed up by a swarm of Mutalisks and that the Hydralisks are staying out of siege
tank range, while making a Baneling drop work to your advantage and defending the main Hive cluster
and- Look. you get the idea."
101,,400CP,Absolute Scientific Mastery,Marvel Cosmic,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Here is the apex of your craft. Scoff at the petty inventions even the likes of Galactus and High
Evolutionary can create. The Maker's Tools? Ha, child's play. If it is scientifically possible to create it, you
can figure it out. If your research or invention would require some undiscovered theory or law then you
can work through that and perhaps even create new fields of study. The only limit to this perk is it must
be something that is scientifically possible either within a setting or through perk fiat. You always know if
something is scientifically possible no matter what setting or world you are in."
102,,600CP,Acausal Link,Revelation Space,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You are able to put your mind into a state where it is able to receive contact with your future self or
access an embedded repository of knowledge.
This may be a process like the Conjoiner's Exordium program, putting your mind in a quantum
superposition with its future self; or perhaps like Aura you were affected by a brush with a paradoxical
computer system before you were born, packing your brain it full of knowledge of more advanced
species, or maybe some other effect or technology is at work: like sharing a part of the network the
Jumper Clowns and Grubs use for communication.
In any case, your mind is able to access scientific advancements that humanity has not yet reached, and
recognizes signs of approaching large-scale events civilization-changing in scale, like the Melding Plague
and the activation of the Inhibitors - in ways humans do not normally sense. The benefit is that warnings
of large-scale change come back clearly, as do hints about crucial, necessary technological
advancements, allowing you to build things decades or centuries in advance of what you might
otherwise have.
This information is very 'noisy', jumbled and hard to pick out details, but you can usually understand the
gist of the principles - a few equations that would otherwise have stumped you, a new reference frame
from which to look at a problem, or a warning ahead of a time of destruction. This is not true
precognition; even in the case of Exordium, the futures sending information back may not come into
being or might even be from timelines that have already been phased out of existence and are largely
irrelevant."

components you would find at your local electronic and home repair stores."
104,,600CP,Architect's Eye,LOSS,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Every structure has a purpose, a reason for being. When it comes to buildings you know exactly what to
do and how to do it. This makes buildings stable, good looking, and comfortable buildings. This also
extends to being able to know the who, what, when, where, and why of any non-weaponized structure.
This expands the more you learn about other cultures, places, science, and technology. Eventually learn
to build things to withstand black holes or places with non-euclidian geometry etc and not compromise
your end goal [allowing something to survive in it]. This also lets you spot weak points, flaws, and
exploits in design as well."
105,,600CP,Archon,Draka Series,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You conquer, Jumper. You are superhumanly skilled in every art or science that a ruler needs. Your
economic skills would let you make financial giants from what were the poorest traders in the land, your
sheer military brilliance would allow you to win wars and battles while outnumbered and outgunned the

themselves and each other for you. While not the first preference for a Draka, your diplomatic skill might
see you making peace between the Alliance and the Draka with some work, or getting the serfs to accept
their fates peacefully. Whether it be military strategy and tactics, bureaucratic organization and
manipulation, public relations and speechmaking, economics and trade, diplomacy and negotiation,
intelligence analysis and intrigue, or what have you, you are one of the very, very best at it. You were
born to rule and rule you will, by whatever means you choose to do so."
106,,600CP,Bamboo technology,Factorio,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"It's hard enough to build something as complex as a rocket without advanced synthetic materials and
rare earth metals for maximum performance. You know how to push the mechanical limits of the most
common elements through creative means to construct things far past what should be possible, allowing
you to construct high-tech devices with low-tech materials. You could easily build something on par with
the main battle tanks of the 21st century with iron plates, cheap plastic, water and wood pulp. Just don't
try to build your rocket out of actual bamboo."
107,,600CP,Code Wizard,Mass Effect Andromeda,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Some folks are good at surviving in the jungle, but you are the pro at conquering the Concrete Jungle! Or,
well, whatever material your surroundings end up being constructed out of. Towards that end, you can
get access to whatever local electronics and/or computer systems are around. Even a completely
different programming language or hardware materials science is only a temporary speed bump to
someone like you. You can quickly figure out what hardware does what for computer systems, and can
interpret the coding language of the systems you encounter. Once you know how to say what you want,
it's a simple step to figure what to say to gain access to the system. SAM Connection: With an AI in your
head to quickly handle all the brute work of figuring out the system, you can simply wave your hand to
get a foreign technology to do what you want. You still need a bit of time for you and your head-buddy to
figure out the system, but once you know the basics, the things you can achieve by just waving your
hand at a computer is positively magical. Why, it's almost like technopathy"
108,,600CP,Deus Machina,NieR Automata,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"As an Artificial Intelligence, you are limited to the digital world. You could possess the body of a machine
for certain but such a thing is...limiting at the best of times. Wouldn't it be grand if you weren't so
harshly limited? If you could physically act without relying on the admittedly weak bodies of your
machine pets? Now you can, in a limited way. The real world is no longer so different from the digital one
to you. The blocks and code of the computerized realm exist in reality as well, so long as you look at
things a certain way. The powers you have as a Terminal, as well as any other similar data related
powers, now work outside of the computer though at a weakened level. Whatever your powers may be
online, they will be significantly weakened in reality if channelled through this ability. As a Terminal, you
might be nigh unstoppable online but in reality, your powers would be closer to that one might expect of
a fantasy wizard. Teleportation, cloning yourself a dozen times over, manipulating matter in a short area
around yourself, transmuting objects or even overriding the minds of others potentially. You are no
longer such a god as you were in the digital world but your powers remain terrible indeed."
109,,600CP,Essence Spinner,Starcraft - The Zerg,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You know the essence and DNA and you know the exact strands with which to induce a variety of
mutations and evolutions upon zerg organisms under your control. With a simple feather from a cliffjumping
raptor or the acidic spit from a predatory beetle, you can break down the essence and proteins
within each of these to their building blocks and re-assemble them into a strain fit for yourself and your
minions. As a bonus, you can produce a simple silk-like screen that allows you to manipulate these
strains and magnify them into a view capable of being seen from even a simple human eye. Said silk
screen also allows you to manipulate these strands by hand."
110,,600CP,Flexible Doctrine,Galactic Civilizations II,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"From Anti-Matter Torpedoes to Kanvium Armor technologies, it's a fact that space-borne warfare is
highly reliant on the equipment you provide your forces with. The release of the Hyperdrive design has
led to a new arms race of unprecedented might but that also means you can end up caught completely
off-guard.
Over-extending your technological R&D into missiles might end up with your forces utterly outmatched if
an enemy starts equipping their ships with masses of point defenses, ECM, and other anti-missile
systems, and the same is true if you're built to defend against mass drivers and suddenly face ships with
energy beams instead.
If only you had a decent energy weapon or some Mass Drivers instead and now, you likely will. You and
your people will find that any kind of military technology, be it weaponry, defenses, or any other such
systems you need for your forces, is now merely the first option of many. The time and effort needed to
develop alternative military options (based on existing but 'lesser' methods you might possess) to match
what you can already do is vastly reduced.
So if your most powerful weapon is a Mass Driver of some sort (say a Quantum Driver), you could get
your hands on Beam Weapons or Missile tech that are equally effective - except your opponent might
not have suitable defenses for them. Likewise, if all you have is armor and your foes start using beam
weapons, your desk will probably see a report or two on breakthroughs in shield technologies before the
week is over.
Furthermore, you'll find that adjusting any existing systems you have deployed is far easier than it
otherwise was - modular components and interchangeable system parts ensuring that equipping your
fleets with what they need to turn the tide is not going to stay a mere idea."
111,,600CP,Genius of Osakabe,Arpeggio of Blue Steel,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You are privy to the secrets of Professor Osakabe, the creator of the Design Children. This skill in genetics
allows you to create 'test-tube babies' from donor samples and genetically enhance them for specific
traits most notably, their intelligence, memory retention, creativity, intuition and reasoning. Such
children have the potential to change the nation maybe even the world before they so much as hit
puberty, far surpassing the intellect of any natural human and coming up with creative schemes that the
Fog could never imagine. Please use this talent carefully even the brilliant professor himself was unable
to prevent more than a fraction of 'his' children from dying, and that nearly destroyed him. I hope, for
your sake and theirs, that you are able to iron out any flaws in the process."
112,,600CP,Greenfinger,Starbound,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You have a great power, the ability to commune with and control any and all forms of plant life. Beyond
even that, however, is your ability to grow plants under your control which can mimic the effects of
technology. You need some understanding of the underlying principles, but once you have that, organic
teleporters, plasma weapons, spaceships, and more are all possibilities.
These technologies can retain benefits of their plant-like origin, including photosynthesis, regeneration,
and other plant-based attributes."
113,,600CP,Incredibly Craftsmanship,Akame ga Kill,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"While the method of creating Teigu is long lost you are able to create things almost at their level, with
some research and a couple other skilled people you might even be able to recreate the lost arts that
created the Teigu long ago. You also have all the skills to repair Teigu or other incredible items from near
destruction."
114,,600CP,Inventor of an Era,Generic Dystopia,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Maybe your claim to fame lies in your inventions, or maybe it's all done away from the prying eyes of the
media. Regardless, with your inventing skill, you could be known as one of the great scientists of the new
world. Your skills are focused, perfected, and many. You could create advanced devices for anything from
sanitation to advertisement, make new advances in nano- or holo-technology, or create new energy
drinks that increase focus and productivity. You are capable of constructing robots, and if those robots
aren't quite smart enough to do what you want, you could always just use a human brain. Well, that's
the shortcut most people take. Maybe your advances in AI could put an end to that?"
115,,600CP,Izuru Kamakura,Danganronpa,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Just like the one they called Izuru Kamukura, you have a great deal of potential when it comes to
Ultimate abilities. With time and training, you're capable of picking up new Ultimate abilities with
months of light effort, gaining a level of proficiency which most people couldn't achieve with a lifetime of
work. Whilst Izuru Kamukura soon became bored with humanity after mastering every talent known to
man, you will not lose your empathy in the process unless you want to for whatever reason."
116,,600CP,Just another gun,Factorio,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"With a glance, you know how something can be turned to destructive ends. With something in hand and
an enemy in sight, you know how effective your weapon of choice will be against him. Ideas on how to
craft weapons from existing knowledge comes easily, and the more you know about something or
someone you wish to destroy, the better you can craft something to destroy them. There is nothing you
cannot weaponize, if only in some niche manner for an equally niche situation."
117,,600CP,Technological Upgrade,World Seed,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Spaceship captains, rulers of both kingdoms and planets alike, and people similarly reigning over the
masses or in possession of a vast amount of land have access to a special kind of system in Neolife. A
sort of management menu, it allows people to upgrade their territories in two kinds of ways: the first is a
technology upgrade, which a ruler could use to add irrigation to a field or to increase the defense of a
city. If there is a design provided, it will be instantly built once the upgrade finishes in around a week."
118,,600CP,Mad Science!,Eureka-Warehouse 13-alphas,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Most people would say that it's impossible, not to mention extremely reckless. Not you. Given enough
time and resources, and a general disregard for the potential consequences, you can do almost anything
technologically possible to achieve. Occasionally things get out of hand and run amok, but that's a risk
you're willing to take. Plus, it occasionally results in accidental inventions and discoveries. For SCIENCE!"
119,,600CP,Marain Diaglyths,The Culture Minds,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"The language of the Culture is one of its greatest achievements. The characters of Marain are written on
a 3x3 grid, but when used by Minds, are capable of encoding information in a fractal-like manner.
Anything describable can be written in a single Marain diaglyph, all the way up to the entire universe,
with every particle, vector and wave within it. Of course, the time needed to write such a glyph would
take as long as the age of the universe itself.
This perk grants you the ability of Culture Minds to express and read data in this way: to describe an
entire library of information in one character, to perform a mathematical operation millions of lines long
in a single step, or simply to read one character and know immediately and exactly how the described
but not-yet- invented musical instrument will sound.
This effect extends to any written system of language you are fluent in, and allows you to express the
deeper information to non-Minds for example if you write the sun in reference to a particular sun, the
reader would know precisely what the sun is its coordinates, its dimensions, its spectrographic signature
and its history, if you chose to encode all that information into the writing."
120,,600CP,Personal Analysis,E.V.O. Search for Eden,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You possess an innate and intricate understanding of the natural processes of your form, whatever those
might be, down to the sub-atomic level. This means you have an incredible understanding of things like
your body chemistry, cellular activity, and much more. This extends to forms in your Record of Evolution,
letting you examine and understand them in incredible detail as well. Also excellent in diagnosing any
health issues or damage you've sustained, or guiding your evolution with a precision that would be
impossible otherwise."
121,,600CP,Resident Mad Scientist,Schlock Mercenary Rebuild,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"There are certain technologies out there that simply shatter the status quo. The teraport, the long gun,
Laz'r'us. Now, you can be the source of similarly groundbreaking discoveries. You are a mad genius, easily
capable of combining wildly divergent pieces of technology to come up with a synergistic masterpiece
that will overturn the status quo. Even your lesser discoveries will end up being similarly groundbreaking."
122,,600CP,Slump Science,Dragon Ball,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Not everything has to be about fighting, you know. The marvels your genius will make will exceed such
brute force! While it may not be useful for things like pure combat or doomsday weapons, you're able to
make things like a watch that can shrink the person who wears it, or a rice cooker that creates objects
based on pictures you feed it. Though they tend to be whimsical, you can engineer marvels that wouldn't
be uncommon in the household of the Briefs family or one Doctor Norimaki. The laws of physics and
even common sense now mean little to what you can build with enough time and resources, and you
may be able to expand on that even further...just don't get too distracted with other things, alright?"
123,,600CP,Sum of its Parts,Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You understand how to create expandable systems, keeping complexity low while still allowing for
different materials or more production to be added in the future. Complex systems make sense to you.
You can see the logic behind even the oddest bit of system design, and you can expand it if you find the
reasoning sound. Finally, the bigger the system or factory you created is, the more productive it is.
Adding more machines makes everything faster and more efficient."
124,,600CP,Tech tree,Factorio,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Science is a messy process, requiring the study of dozens of disparate phenomena, looking for patterns,
finding ways to use that information to build stuff that incorporates what you've learned, and then
mashing it all together to get an 'invention.' Now you can take some of the guesswork out of it. When
you desire to build something, you know just what you need to study to make that thing a reality. Want
to get a rocket into orbit? Well, now you know what things contribute to rocketry, what kinds of math
you must refine to get the equations you'll need answered, and what kinds of materials you should be
experimenting with. If you are completely lacking knowledge of a particular field of study, then you'll
know how to use what you do have to get where you need. Keep in mind that it may take you a very,
very, long time to create new fields of SCIENCE entirely on your own."
125,,600CP,Technician | Core Competence,Spiral Knights,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Technician (200CP) The tech knights of the spiral order are experienced mechanics, but are often not as
experienced in weapon usage. Only a few, known as Technicians, have quick thinking and bravery
necessary to utilize their skills in combat situations. You are a prime example of this truth, having learnt
to use your skills out in the field within the fires of combat. Your skills range from making quick repairs to
creating, maintaining, and even rapidly dismantling complex mechanical constructs, even something as
complicated as a battlepod. Needless to say, your skill in disabling locks, deploying turrets for some
much-needed suppressive firepower, repairing the armor of your squad mates, and the like are greatly
appreciated by your squad mates and essential to survival within a world of machines.
Core Competence (400CP) The Cradle is a dangerous place for the Spiral Order, and not only due to it's
indigenous wildlife. There are too many unknowns, too many variables to be comfortable with. That is
why it falls to people like you, One of the most naturally gifted researchers within the Order, to increase
the odds of safety. Your attention to detail has increased dramatically, letting you pick out and recognize
patterns in the construction and design of machinery much more quickly than others. Understanding
these patterns has given you incredible insights into technology found in the Cradle and in the Gremlin
bases, along with how it can compare and blend with technology of the Order you are so familiar with...
and your own, which you are even more familiar with. When the Order finally reaches The Core, perhaps
you will be one of the most likely members of it to unlock the secrets held within."
126,,600CP,Whispered,Full Metal Panic,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Due to a Soviet experiment a while ago, you're one of the exceptionally rare people known as the
Whispered. they have an incredibly advanced knowledge of math, science, engineering, etc though each
Whispered only specializes in a single area. If they take the time to learn or supplement this with other
technical skills, it's possible to potentially create Black Technology of their own."
127,,600CP,Wizard to Be,D.Y.N. Freaks,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Too long have you had to beg for power from others or rely on magical objects to support you. Now
you've gained the ability to take bits and pieces of those powers for yourself. Whenever you are
receiving supernatural power from a contract with a being or magical item, you are able to slowly make
that power become your own, taking longer the more powerful an item is. A basic grimoire of spells
might take just a few days or weeks whilst the Necronomicon itself could take many years of continued
use. Whilst you can only draw this way from a few artefacts at a time, perhaps three or four, you will find
that once you have managed to entirely take all that power for yourself, it will take on a new form
personalised to you, often with either greater power or new effects attached to it."
128,,600CP,An Order To Things,Gunnerkrigg Court,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You can understand how things fit together in abstract or practical ways. Understand how somebody
lives (and where they would hide things) by how they set the items around their dwelling, deduce
feelings from handwriting, grow a robot, decipher languages too complex for normal humans. Though
things that you seek to make happen, rather than deduce where or how it happened, are much harder
to pull off. You can see how someone else grew a robot but doing it yourself would take experimenting
and progress, though these things move much faster than you."
129,,800CP,The Science of Evolution,E.V.O. Search for Eden,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"Theory? To you evolution is an entire scientific field in it's own right, one you have more than mastered.
From the how, to the why, to mathematics to quantify and calculate it, to the crystals and other devices
to manipulate and interact with it, to even the quantum physics that influence it at the smallest levels of
reality. This knowledge is essentially the complete and collected data from all of the evolution that has
taken place on Earth, up to the birth of civilization. The question is, what will you do with this
knowledge? While the bulk of it relates to biological evolution, it'd only take a little effort on your part to
apply this to the evolution of non-biological systems, such as computer viruses or society."
130,,800CP,They're Gonna Have To Invent A New Type of Nobel Prize to Give Us.,Portal,Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills,"You gain Cave Johnson's ability to create something impossible out of something completely, incredibly
different. This ability is heavily reliant on your resources, how difficult a problem the completely,
incredibly different thing is, and pays out only in the long term, but it's worth it.
In honor of Cave, I'll explain it using Aperture's history. In the 1940's the curtain company Aperture
Fixtures tried to solve a problem that our Earth scientific community still has no definite answer for: the
shower curtain effect. Somehow, Cave's engineers managed to solve it by creating a quantum tunnel
between the inside and outside of a shower.
In the 50's, they were researching that effect with funding second only to Black Mesa and used
astronauts and Olympians as test subjects. They threw employee safety and retention out the window,
disregarded every form of ethics imaginable, and were ultimately driven into an absurd level of
bankruptcy thirty years later.
Even when the company was on its last legs after GLaDOS was activated and tried to kill everyone with
neurotoxin, she described the team at Aperture as being the greatest minds of a generation. This can be
considered the perfect scenario for helping this perk function at full capacity.
Fifty years of constant, no expenses spared, abnormally efficient research primarily focused on a single
effect using a gigantic testing facility and eschewing all concerns except results. A Jumper doesn't have to
disregard ethics to have the perk working at that level, but they'd need to use human equivalent robots
like GLaDOS eventually did.
What did that half century result in? They perfected the portal gun, which functions by harnessing and
stabilizing a black hole in a device half the size of someone's arm. Ignoring the potential for free energy
with careful use of portals, they built the black hole equivalent of a dyson sphere and used it to create
tunnels in the fabric of reality. Why? Because fifty years ago, they wanted to make a really useful shower
curtain.
That's what this perk can look like. It's never clear when this perk is going to proc, but it will happen
often enough to make the capstone worth taking. If the Jumper isn't helping it run at peak capacity or
spending decades on one project, it'll result in innovations that are still useful but aren't on the level of
the portal gun. Some examples are repulsion gel, storage containers that can survive the heat of the sun,
tiny fusion reactors, and footwear that allows a human to jump off a building and land unharmed.
Technologies researched with this ability can't always be generalized. The portal gun uses a black hole to
tear holes in the fabric of reality, but that was the only thing Aperture could reliably do with one. They
didn't have any ability to build a black hole into a weapon or use it for energy."

only do you have a comprehensive grasp of botany in the real world, but you also gain an extremely
rapid understanding of plants of all types just by looking at them once. You can tell what their best
conditions of growth are, how they could be enhanced and improved, all sorts of things. You're also able
to modify them, rather extensively at that. You have a talent for designing plants, making incredibly
beautiful or sturdy versions, or even both.
Genius Boosted: You skills with plants are now the equal of David Blazing himself! You can design plants
for all sorts of purposes now, including things no one has any business using plants for. Biology, the Laws
of Physics or Common Sense, nothing can stop in your way as you grant frankly ridiculous powers to your
creations. You could design Chillies that explode, Squashes that Squash enemies, or Cherries that
Explodonate. More than this, you're more than capable of giving them full and complete Sapience, so
much so that they could go to college, even.
Genius! (400CP) You are an absolute Genius, with this perk! Your mind works tens, hundreds of times as
fast as even the most clever of your fellows, excepting the true once-in-a-millennium genii like the one or
