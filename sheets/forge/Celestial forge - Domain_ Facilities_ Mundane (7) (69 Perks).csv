1,,100CP,Advance Processor Fabricator ,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,This quantum scale fabricator is focused on producing complex processors and other computer chips. It is able to create quantum computing matrices including seven state processing chipsets.
2,,100CP,Auto-Factory ,Starbound,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A room full of various arms and other tools, this factory is designed to be programmed with the blueprints for any item that you know how to create, allowing for raw materials to be fed in from the ship's storage, and be turned into whatever items are programmed into the factory. Warning: Only items that run on purely mechanical / scientific principles can be made here. If something requires magic or more esoteric energies to be created, it will require your personal touch to actually make, though individual parts could still be crafted by the factory. Can't make items bigger than the room itself, though it can build the pieces for you to put together yourself later.
* 100cp because a 1 module ship costs that"
3,,100CP,Data Khala ,Starcraft Protoss,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"While psionics are powerful, sometimes a technological solution is needed. This is the Templars solution to a technological Khala. A powerful digital Khala that links together all the different Purifier units. You have your own version of this. With this, all of your computers and AI can communicate with each other over cosmic distances with zero lag time. Instantaneous information sharing. As the centre of this digital Khala you can link into, and communicate with, it too."
4,,100CP,Laboratorium ,Light of Terra DLC 3 - A Grand Day Out,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Ancient cogitators, arrays of auspex systems, and volume upon volume of documentation supply an Adept with the tools and information necessary to capably analyse a recovered technological artefact.
* Extremely high tech lab for studying artefacts. From Warhammer 40k."
5,,100CP,Matter Manipulator ,Starbound,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Manipulates anything that matters. Well,solids, at least. It basically allows for the collection of any and all materials. For an extra 100 CP, it can collect liquid, and also mines 4 times faster, 4 times as much at once and twice as far away. It can also paint stuff as wire things. If you don't purchase this, you'll have to get the upgrades yourself with manipulator modules.
* This is the 4chan version, the SB version is a whole chapter."
6,,100CP,Research and Development Center ,Mass Effect Andromeda,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"The R&D center is integral to the Initiative's colonization efforts in the Heleus cluster. There is one in every settlement. As you increase the amount of information you discover, the more you will be able to progress and discover in the Research section. And Development allows a user to build any object that you have the blueprints/plans for and resources to make it. If you have a ship, you can choose to integrate this into the ship. While the R&D center is initially limited to making things that are man portable, with the appropriate upgrades, that may change. After all, Remnant Vaults have such interesting technology...
Post Jump, you can choose to have the R&D center be integrated with your Warehouse, have it be placed somewhere mid jump, or even have it be connected to a robot of some sort for mobile crafting purposes."
7,,100CP,Sburb Starter Kit ,SBURB,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Don't feel like upgrading your Sylladex to drag your equipment back to your interdimensional 
warehouse? That's okay! This upgrade equips your warehouse with a Cruxtruder, Punch Designex, Totem Lathe, and Alchemiter! Now you have some extra ones,and you don't have to rob the you of this life's house. If you want any other upgrades, you'll have to make them yourself. You should be able to do that from your warehouse now though.
(Note: Purchasing this Cruxtruder and opening it for the first time will not give you another)
* Would probable needs a Sylladex too to work
* Allows manipulation of Item data on punch cards, probable hard to find in other perks"
8,,100CP,Specimen Bio-Tank ,Resident Evil,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Well, your B.O.W. specimens have to come from somewhere don't they? They don't just pop out of the ground like those plebeian zombies, and what if you need to make some adjustments? Upon purchasing this, you gain access to a sophisticated bio-tank which is filled with a special fluid. This will not only ensure the B.O.W. is docile and unconscious while immersed, but it also comes with the tools and devices to monitor and make adjustments to the subject inside as needed. Evil laugh not included."
9,,100CP,Starting HUB | Satisfactorio Builder ,Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"-Starting HUB (100CP) Instead of starting with a box containing only the most critical components of the HUB, you start with a prefab base in a box. Set it up anywhere, and as long as you empty it out you can move it around. This base has a craft bench, equipment workshop, a molecular analysis machine, an RTG that produces a small amount of power perpetually, and a spot for the research dropship to land. In addition, it has a rack with a few standard storage boxes and a bunk room big enough for all of you. You start with all recipes that you get from completing the HUB in-game unlocked. Respawns monthly. In addition, you can keep this and drop it at your starting location in future Jumps, if you want.
-Satisfactorio Builder (0CP) The buildy gun from Satisfactory. It can place down buildings and other artificial structures, either from parts or premade. It can deconstruct buildings and other artificial objects, either breaking them down or storing them whole. It can give orders to logistic or construction systems that you are authorized on (including the ones from this Gauntlet.) It can configure the settings of machines. It has an internal inventory that can be upgraded (to a limited extent until you leave the Gauntlet.)
Always fully charged, can be upgraded in other ways, automatically imports into similar handheld stuff, and syncs up with other inventory/storage Perks, Items, and items. If lost, stolen, or broken, it will respawn in an appropriate and safe place immediately, even during the Gauntlet.
* Builder is required to make use of the HUB, it is also a free item."
10,,100CP,Weapons Lab ,Starbound,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A lab full of analysis and test equipment, aimed specifically at deciphering and improving deadly weaponry. You can use this lab to analyze any weapons that you come across, and given time, can figure out how to isolate and combine the different features of the weapons into other weaponry you create. Comes with a melee and firing range for testing out any weapons as well.
* 100cp because a 1 module ship costs that"
11,,100CP,Workshop ,Bubblegum Crisis,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Do you need tools? You have ALL the tools. Using this, you can effectively build and/or repair any damn thing in BGC, though constructing orbital shuttles might take a while. Never mind getting a hold of the plans. Can act as an independent location or as an upgrade/attachment to Canyon Garage or Underground Hideout."
12,,100CP,Workshop ,Dark Cloud 2,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A small workshop for Mechanics that is geared largely towards building small machines, medium machines...and well, massive machines as well. You'll have to adjust the tools accordingly yourself for different machines, but the workshop will scale to fit what machines you put into it. Will slowly repair any machines placed inside.
* Repairs Machines placed inside, no matter the level."
13,,100CP,Workshop ,Personal Reality Supplement v1.3,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Each purchase of this adds to your Personal Reality, a Workshop needed to perform a specific type of craft, which is to be specified when purchase is made. It comes with a basic set of tools and supplies. Good for fixing or creating all sorts of things, although any complex parts or nonstandard supplies will have to be brought in from outside. Additional purchases can add different types of Workshops to your Personal Reality or expand existing ones. Anything built in one of those workshops is fiat backed to be restored to its original condition within 48 hours if damaged or destroyed
* Grants fiat backing to anything constructed within"
14,,200CP,Bat Computer ,Injustice,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Now this is a must for the enterprising superhero, a supercomputer composed of some of the most bleeding-edge hardware on the planet, capable of hacking into the vast majority of systems worldwide. It can process and transmit information far faster than nearly any other, and it has a number of forensic programs built in. Perhaps most notable is its capacity to analyze and reverse-engineer nearly any substance within the space of a few minutes and it will eventually prove its ability to do so when it provides the insurgency with the secret to the Regime's nanotech pills."
15,,200CP,FormOther Brand Medical Pod ,Hive Queen Quest,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This medical pod is filled with an odd odorless liquid, when a being is placed inside it goes to work stabilizing and then healing them while simultaneously analyzing and storing information about their biology, which makes it incredibly useful for the study of new species. Large enough to fit a large man, fits more if the specimen has no bones Comes in either Technological or Biotech flavors, both function equally well."
16,,200CP,INFINITE FUN SPACE WORLDS ,The Culture Minds,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A numinous selection of metamathical simulated universes which can be indistinguishable from the real thing. You can live out any fantasies you like in them, from the most realistic slices of life to wildly outrageous war simulations, to varying degrees of controlled narrative or pure mechanistic outcome, and to realistic or magical physics or metaphysics. Or, simply conduct experiments and sims for science and personal enlightenment? These many virtual universes do not consume any of your personal processing ability or memory to maintain.
* Where else can you find infinite simulated universes that you can fully control that can simulate magic and normal physics perfectly.
* Might not be easy to use for anyone without massive computational skill, this thing is meant to be used by Minds on ships which are basically very very powerful AIs."
17,,200CP,Lab ,Project Arms,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This discrete laboratory, hidden away somewhere close to your start point, or elsewhere if you wish, holds a simple automated facility to allow for any mechanical devices brought to be maintained and repaired to their peak functionality. It works best with cybernetics and mechanical prosthetics, and small finicky things like clockwork and computers and not large clunky things like vehicles. It is normally in possession of enough regenerating supplies to keep yourself and your companions properly maintained, plus enough surplus for additional projects here and there.
However, should you have purchased Mecha in the Cyborg Section, this Lab upgrades to be able to handle repairs and maintenance on the Mecha and comparable small vehicles and robots.
Also should you have purchased Cyber-Immortality also from the Cyborg Section you also have three bays with replacement bodies for yourself contained in the lab. The lab can replace bodies taking out of the lab at the rate of 1 per six months and also contains a supercomputer to house your AI mind when it's not in a cyborg body with wireless capacity to allow you to move back and forth within a range of 10 kilometres, which can be upgraded with other technology. Installing your mind in a new body takes roughly half an hour and you can choose for different bodies to have different load-outs and can install your own upgrades with the lab's auto-engineer/surgeon helping."
18,,200CP,Memory Room ,Blade Runner 2049,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A special room, attached to your warehouse or another property that you own, that allows for the creation and even manipulation of memories, as well as their insertion into living beings' minds. The room is about the size of a middling apartment but can otherwise be quite freely manipulated to what you desire by controlling the technology by hand. You're quite skilled at the use of this room but far from a master for now, which will likely take quite a bit of practice and a very active imagination."
19,,200CP,Portable Workshop ,Luck of the Draw,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,You have a top of the line workshop in a pocket dimension that you can access via a free standing arch. You can set the rate of time compression when you purchase the item up to thirty times faster.
20,,200CP,Robo Bunker ,Dragon Ball GT,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"What kind of man of science would you be without your very own lab? Hidden underground in your starting world, this high tech laboratory has everything you need to get started on your robotic weapons of mass destruction. While the facility can function as a normal lab, as well as having basic living quarters and strong security measures, it works best towards designing and manufacturing androids or robots on the individual scale, increasing the quality of these personalised products significantly and cutting the time and resources required to make them to just below half the usual amount."
21,,200CP,Ultimate Research Lab ,Danganronpa,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"You gain a single research lab corresponding to the ultimate ability of you or a companion of your choice. It is a room filled with everything necessary to hone your talents, with the most high-tech equipment for your profession available. Examples include a complete library of notable criminal cases for the Ultimate Detective or a tennis court with robotic opponents of varying difficulties for the Ultimate Tennis Pro.
This will appear in Hope's Peak during the killing game, but will be an extension of your Cosmic Warehouse in future jumps.
* Combos with Izuru Kamakura (from the same jump) to cover anything which can fall under talent with canonical examples including engineering, invention, martial arts, luck and clairvoyance.
* Perk text may suggest updating when imported into a new jump.
* May not contain anything if either Super Highschool Level or Izuru Kamakura from the same jump is not purchased.
* Most high-tech equipment available suggests that it updates to both settings and your own technical abilities."
22,,200CP,Workshop ,Samurai Jack,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A small base filled with all the equipment you'll need to work. This lab can be used for your choice of scientific or magical research.
* Extremely open ended toolkit, it can probably scale to any level. Comes from a space age anime jump.
* Works for magic"
23,,200CP,Workshop ,Smash Up,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A well-appointed workshop, overflowing with brass, vacuum tubes, and specialized tools. Inspiration comes more easily within these walls."
24,,200CP,Workshop/3D Fabricator ,GUNNM,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Powered tools for cyborg disassembly and repair. Bulky diagnostic computer, ten kilograms of miscellaneous spare parts, very rare compact 3D fabricator capable of milling custom components and printing or repairing circuitry. Free Rocket Hammer"
25,,300CP,Advanced Laboratory ,Green Lantern,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"One of the most advanced on Earth, at that. This is a state-of-the-art lab and workshop, filled with the finest equipment money can buy, uniquely set up to allow you to work on just about any branch of science you wish to. Be it building a car or examining an alien body, you won't find facilities better than the ones here, that's for sure."
26,,300CP,Crafting Stations ,Fallout 4,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"You have each of the main crafting stations (capable of making armor, weapons, and chems) in your Warehouse; each one greatly simplifies the process of crafting or modifying items. In addition, each one also seems to have the filler items that you'd need; the various chemicals and parts that aren't a significant or expensive part of whatever you're crafting. They can't provide anything supernatural or rare, but small amounts of metal for a new gun mod or some dye is fine."
27,,300CP,Holocron Crafting Station ,Star Wars The Old Republic,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This crafting station allows you to impart any skill (or set of skills) you have into a holocron, which others may use to learn the skill(s). Requires 8 hours of meditation for each year's worth of training imparted. When used, the holocron increases the user's skills as though you were training them yourself. Both the creation process and the user's education include the effects of all teaching perks you possessed at the time of the holocron's creation when measuring the rate at which they occur. You may place any restriction you can name on who can access your holocrons, and those restrictions will be enforced by Jump Fiat. You may 'update' an already-created holocron to use your new current set of training perks, or modify the restrictions you've placed on it, by bringing it back to the crafting station and meditating with it for 1 hour, modified by teaching perks. Your holocrons may include any subject that can reasonably be described as being 'taught', even if it is not necessarily a 'skill' per se, such as philosophy. You may combine any number of lessons into the same holocron, and choose the exact manner (order, relative emphasis, and so forth) in which they are taught.
* Literally crafts Holocrons"
28,,300CP,Project Destroyer of Worlds ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"What if a person could be made better? If they could possess the density of lead with the volatility of cesium? Think of the power one could have if infused with the properties of materials. Enter this particle infusion chamber. When a person goes in, programming in specifics of how a person should be effected when inserting one or more materials for the infusion process will see them come out with potentially new properties or powers based on the material. Whether they look like they have pieces replaced by these materials or simply possess the properties is up to you, but now there is an answer to Captain America. Become the Destroyer of Worlds."
29,,300CP,Simulated Biome ,E.V.O. Search for Eden,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Added onto your warehouse is a door, which will take you to a large dome chamber. Just be thinking about it you can make this chamber simulate any environment, biosphere, and/or life form beyond its indestructible glass walls and use the controls to tweak the conditions and examine what happens. The space beyond the walls is effectively impossible to interact with in any way aside from the functions of this attachment. The options you have for this simulation will expand as your knowledge and technology does, letting you apply the best of both your mind and potential gear towards seeing just what happens when you mess with the natural order. You might occasionally think you hear a voice berating you for your folly in playing god, but I can assure you that it's all in your head."
30,,300CP,Simulation Room ,World Seed,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"One important device any spaceship captain should have in their arsenal, or any militaristic leader at all, for that matter, is a simulation room. With them, it is possible to train against enemy forces all day long in a nigh-infinite amount of configurations and situations, an invaluable preparation for whenever the real thing happens, at least as long as you have accumulated enough data of what it is you need to fight and analyzed their strengths and weaknesses. But it is exactly this problem that the simulation room you have in your possession has solved. As long as you have experienced something personally, you simply need to link your mind with the simulation device, and it will quickly and accurately extrapolate from that information and manage to create a simulation of it that is at least 99.9% accurate, even if you only looked at an enemy fleet and never actually saw its combat capabilities, only growing more accurate as you gain more information. Any amount of people can use this room, its dimensions expanding and contracting as needed and new spots popping up in the same way, and this extrapolation can be used on anyone connecting their mind to it. By default, this is a warehouse attachment, but you can place it wherever you want in the real world."
31,,400CP,Advanced Lab ,Timespinner,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A high-tech laboratory, kitted out with everything needed for high-end scientific exploration. It has an assembly line that can be set-up to transform raw materials into machinery via set blueprints or break down trash into raw materials, vats for cloning and developing living tissue, and offices and workspaces for general development. It is controlled and powered by a central energy core, which also doubles as a supercomputer. It can be accessed via a door in your warehouse, and can be physically inserted into a Jump and accessed directly. Finally, special spacio-temporal support buffers allow it to survive in the event of the universe ceasing to exist, and it will emergency teleport you within itself in such an event, until it is safe to emerge."
32,,400CP,Augmentation Suite ,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Not everybody can build a better future, but the advance of technology has made it more than possible to build a better man. These tools include those required to both maintain, service, construct, and even design or install nearly any cybernetic implant or device imaginable. Of special note is the high end fabrication capabilities that can let you throw together such devices within minutes to hours, allowing you to respond to your needs on the fly. An installation suite includes the medically sterile space necessary to perform even the most complicated or delicate operation involved, and all the requisite tools. Whether you're setting up shop in a professional manner or servicing the more shady types out of the back of an expanded bus for dirty money, you have everything you need or could want. You may choose to have all of this connected to or fused with your warehouse. Everything replenishes and is restored in a day if destroyed, and you have a limitless supply of materials barring anything truly extraordinary which will require you to provide yourself."
33,,400CP,Auto Shop ,My Life As A Teenage Robot,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This item is some kind of repair shop owned or otherwise freely accessible by you. The facilities here are able to repair any Mechanical device within 8 hours, including yourself, and can easily and quickly install any upgrades or technologies. And more so this shop is able to 'reformat' any mechanical or technological device, altering its aesthetics in any possible way and changing its basic form. When reformatting you can also have Mechanical capabilities adjusted, altering them in a give and take fashion. The shop can be staffed by anyone/thing you want or fully automated so long as this nature doesn't provide noticeable advantage beyond the item's function"
34,,400CP, Black Supercomputer ,Lucy,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Everyone needs one, really. Or they should have one anyway. Unlimited storage and borderline unlimited processing power, omni-compatible I/O jacks, indestructible, immune to malware, and with crystal-clear wi-fi wherever you go, it also has the most intuitive, perfect UI imaginable and an operating system that's magically compatible with pretty much anything you could install. You could even install an AI into the operating system if you had one available, although this item does not come with one.
It's conveniently portable and morphs into any computing device you wish with just a thought. Mainframe workstation, pro gaming desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, smartwatch, whatever. Either way its functionalities remain the same even if the exact details of the UI might differ from form to form. If it's lost or left behind, you can summon it to you with a thought. In future worlds the internet connection remains, but only to the current jump's internet equivalent.
Lastly, it comes with a limited perception filter that guarantees that no one will notice any of the special features of your device unless you wish them to, although they will still be able to see that it's there.
* Portable, returns to you, has SEP field
* Unlimited memory and near unlimited processing power
* Perfect UI"
35,,400CP,Candyland ,Fantastic Four,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"What is a scientist without a worthy lab? Yours is, thankfully. Indeed, few laboratories in the world could be found that would be able to beat this place. You have a huge lab setup, probably spanning multiple floors of a huge building or a truly ridiculously sized compound on the ground, and when it comes to Science of any and all kinds, this place is as close to nirvana as it gets. It doesn't even matter what kind of science you pursue, as the facilities here cover every single one of them. From biology to advanced astrophysics to psychology, this place has the very, absolute finest facilities possible to get millions, potentially billions of dollars worth of equipment. The quantities you have here of things depends on their rarity in the outside world, but you have an unlimited supply of everything 'common', including live bodies of generic non-people and animals, all up to specifications. From there the rarer something is the fewer samples you have of it, but no matter if it's rare samples of bacteria, radioactive metals or anything in between, this place is bound to have some of it, enough to make something good. Everything restocks, again depending on rarity, but even the rarest samples are back in a couple months. In future worlds too, everything here, including the databanks in the computers, updates to equal levels in the local world."
36,,400CP,Chrysalis ,Starcraft - The Zerg,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A human sized, pulsating Chrysalis that.... Looks oddly familiar. Wait, you know why now. This was the same kind of pod that was formed around the one known as Sarah Kerrigan, where abathur remade the Ghost into the Queen of Blades, now it seems you can do the same, any organic subject around the size of an average human will go into a deep sleep when fastened into the Chrysalis, during which you can modify them to a level of detail only seen in individuals like Alexi Stukov. Although you will need the knowledge to properly utilize it, the Chrysalis gives all the benefits of a professional, well-funded surgery room in it's compact organic form."
37,,400CP,Custom Factory ,Warhammer 40k: T'au Empire,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This Factory complex is four stories high and covers about 100 acres of ground. It is fully automated to produce various T'au technologies, but its machines and software are modular and easily upgraded or modified to any purely mundane technologies you have the designs for and tools to build. Its output could supply weapons, armor, ammunition, mechanized armor, and miscellaneous supplies for a 50,000 ordinary T'au Fire Caste in combat, constantly, on its own, without worrying about supplies, though upgrading its technologies or providing additional raw materials could increase its output. At your discretion, this factory may be replaced with an orbital Shipyard with similar output capabilities and modularity, save for a required focus on void vessels, aerospace vessels, and the ancillary technologies required to construct them."
38,,400CP,Diagnostic Manuals ,Generic Factory,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"You will get a manual for the upkeep and repair of every object you own. Each manual will be detailed enough to diagnose anything that could go wrong in normal use and perform repairs. Manuals for items you buy with CP can never be permanently lost, but you will only ever get one manual for any object you acquire normally- you may want to use a photocopier on those.
* Useful when using items in crafting sources outside of the CF."
39,,400CP,Factory 436-1337 ,Smash Up,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Robots building robots? How perverse. This repurposed Boeing plant can operate at all hours of the night and day, churning out robots of any size, function or design you may wish. Automatically updates with local technology in new settings."
40,,400CP,"Fringe Institute Fab-Unit 20,000 ",World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A marvel of technological wonder, and an outright Wonder at that. This device can take mundane objects and combine them together whilst maintaining the best of the two items. When used the items merge together so that it keeps the chosen properties of each, though without stacking redundant attributes. Ex. A computer chip and a brand new superconductor would produce a new computer chip designed with the superconductor already in place. However, two nearly identical computer chips wouldn't make a computer chip twice as good as the originals."
41,,400CP,Hammer And Forge ,Legend of Zelda Breath Of The Wild - TG,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A personal smithy that you can deploy anywhere, the equipment and fires here are in the best possible condition for truly creating great works of blacksmithing art. Any materials needed to be expended in making these weapons and armor will be replenished, unless they're explicitly supernatural. As a bonus, you'll find that as long as you hang up your shingle, it'll be much easier to find warriors who can make the most of the equipment you craft!"
42,,400CP,Industrial Fabber ,Schlock Mercenary Rebuild,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A massive fabber that is used for industrial applications like building starships. It can't be hosted in a spaceship, but could help you to build your own if fed raw material from space-rocks and such. It is capable of building annie plants if given sufficient time. It comes with a full tech database of all publicly available technologies, and will update to add any new publicly available technologies in future Jumps.
* Can be used to build battleplates read: spaceships meant to tank relativistic orbital bombardments to save planets."
43,,400CP,Lab/Workshop ,Family Matters,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"You have access to an excellent workshop, laboratory, office, art studio, or whatever other facility is required for your creations. After this Jump, these will be connected to your Warehouse. Tools and basic materials are supplied, but special or extremely valuable resources must be acquired for yourself."
44,,400CP,Laboratory ,Batman the Animated Series,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A large research center with millions of dollars' worth of equipment, oriented towards any number of scientific pursuits. In addition to the equipment you also get a team of researchers, thinkers, and other scientifically minded folk that can help you with your work for you to direct. While the building follows you, the staff do not; you instead get a random assortment of new people each Jump, although their skills will be on par with their predecessors."
45,,400CP,Laboratory ,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Of course you need somewhere to work, you buffoon! What, do you think you were going to make some of the greatest wonders in the universe in some busybody's toolshed?! Ahem. This is a fully stocked Galvan laboratory with all the tools and resources needed to do research and development. Subatomic observation platforms, computers with exabytes worth of storage, and so forth. It's a generalist sort of facility but there's room to add to it later if you wish to specialize."
46,,400CP,Launderer System ,No More Heroes,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"You gain a new thing to place in your warehouse, and though you don't exactly know how it works the instruction booklet says it can construct beam katanas of all different styles and usefulness if given the right components or if you don't have those, shoving the right raw ingredients in enough quantity to just manufacture the damn things. With enough technical knowledge, you will be able to discard the manual
* A Beam Katana is basically a Lightsaber from Star Wars"
47,,400CP,Magic IDE ,Generic Videogame Developer,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"IDE that can use any programming language and can offer improvements as well as picking out error, can make duplicate code that is compatible with different OS, and has the ability to slowly finish a program predefined by Jumper with time scaling with complexity, although its limited by hardware capability and writes the code as well as user would normally, except taking longer."
48,,400CP,Modelling Software ,Generic Videogame Developer,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"In the modern day a lot of prototype art is done in the form of 3d models, which requires a drawing tablet and pen as well as software like Maya. While you have the tablet and pen, they are mundane. What isn't is your custom modelling software. Not only is it perfectly designed just for your use, any 3d model you create here has the option of being 3d printed and mailed to you free of charge. So have fun with your plastic 3d printed armor."
49,,400CP,Nanite Fabrication Table ,Stargate Atlantis,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This table has an indented, flat surface roughly the size of a coffin. It is specifically designed to assemble and program/reprogram nanite-based technology without needing clean-room conditions; if you have the right designs it could easily produce something like a nanite plague or medical nanites, and eventually produce self-replicating nanites which became the Asuran-form Replicators. However, the knowledge you will need to design and program any of these constructs must be sought elsewhere: this is merely the tool, not the craftsman."
50,,400CP,Orbital Refinery ,Hive Queen Quest,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This ship is roughly a mile wide and comes stock with all the tools required to mine and refine raw ore into all manner of useable machines though its capacity is rather low, only able to produce two ships a month at most, should refined materials be fed into it the speed would likely increase somewhat while it could also be used to refine ore into ingots at an even faster rate if building machines is not required. Should you wish you could feed any scrap metal you may come across to refine it into useable materials. The refineries major downfall is that it has no ftl capability and must be towed into place, becoming largely stationary."
51,,400CP,Pack-a-Punch Machine ,Call Of Duty - Zombies,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Using the power of Element 115, this machine can upgrade any weapon (and I mean any!), giving it increased damage, ammo capacity, and often a special feature or two (e.g. advanced optical attachment, underbarrel grenade launcher, rapid fire mod). It'll cost you, though."
52,,400CP,Personal Laboratory ,Pokemon Sword and Shield,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Sure, you could get a lot done out of your apartment and publish your findings from notes jotted down in the field, but you're trying to do this for real, right? It's time to be professional about this and get your own lab. What a wonderful lab this is too, part fully finished laboratory, and part home; you'll never have to leave! You can live here, studying a wide variety of subjects using the numerous Pokmon-centric research materials lining the book cases. The Personal Laboratory also comes with additional facilities for any live in assistants you might pick up, with one assistant coming with the purchase and helping with your research. The computers that come with this property are also pretty strong in case you need to run any intense programs.
You have a genetic research lab, why should we keep this one over all the others? We will want a few, but only those that add something that can't just be covered by knowledge of the setting and building whatever makes this special"
53,,400CP,Pyramid ,Assassin's Creed Odyssey,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"A device used for computing possible futures and observing memories of the past. When a future is calculated by the relic, it provides information about the steps that need to be taken and the events that need to happen for the future to be realized. Lesser minds can end up overwhelmed by the information provided from this. The various triangles that make up its surface can be removed and held by individuals. With this version, the memories of those holding or in close contact with a triangle can be read by someone using the 'base' of the pyramid, even from a great distance, and future calculations can still be performed, even when a triangle is missing, though the more triangles are missing, the less precise the calculated future is. All triangles can be summoned back to the base instantly if desired.

54,,400CP,Snake Fortress ,Grant Morrison's 18 Days,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Rather less 'glorious' than most items on this list. This is an incredibly strong, unbelievably advanced fortress, quite possibly the most advanced Yajnatek citadel ever built. Chock-full of laboratories for all kinds of research, auto-generated test subjects, with a gigantic arsenal of defenses and traps and guarded by a legion of Naga Warriors, it's the ideal place to conduct any and all blasphemous, heretical experiment and studies one might be in the mood to engage in.
What might help is that the power of your benefactor makes it so that it's really, staggeringly unlikely and difficult for this place to be found by anyone who would be hostile to you, be they man or god. Not impossible, but... yeah. On the other hand anyone who wants a favor or to conduct business can get here as easily as any other place. It also looks like a giant iron cobra... the whole fortress. Because of course it does."
55,,400CP,The Recycling Towers ,Nier: Automata,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"The Recycling Towers are a set of ten large, floating metal structures. Each one is quite massive, containing many floors and enough room for tens of large robot soldiers to be in. while they would certainly do well as heavily armoured, flying troop transports, their real use is in the gathering and reconstruction of matter. Each Tower can suck up physical objects or material from beneath it, gathering them and then reconstructing the matter to a more preferable form inside the Tower. The towers creation abilities are not absolute but it is still able to create almost any of the machine life forms in this world, which can be quite complicated, and it may be possible to program more complex instructions into the fortresses."
56,,400CP,Tiny Manufacturing Plant ,Generic Videogame Developer,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Haven't you always wanted to bring your imaginary tech to life? Well, this is a step in the right direction. In your possession is a machine that can create any technological device that can fit through a 1 meter x 1 meter square. All it takes is time and the schematics. Tech related to video games, such as a console, will take about an hour, while non game related tech will take an extra 3 hours, with incredibly complex technology taking even longer."
57,,400CP,Updation Device ,Doctor Who,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This is nice! Very nice, actually. Not quite Time Lord tech, or any other that you can tell, actually. It's just a little something that seems to have dropped out of nowhere. But that's not as interesting as what it does! Because what it does is really, really interesting!
This device has a very strange ability, in that it brings out the best in everything and everyone it's used on. Use it on a machine, and it upgrades that machine to the absolute latest, best version of it that exists in any time or place in the setting. These upgrades are permanent and adapting, so if there are further improvements made in the design they're reflected in your copy of the thing too.
But it doesn't just work on machines. It works on people too! Used on a person, it raises them to be among the absolute 0.0001 percentile of their race and species, boosting their physical statistics, their intellect, everything. It fixes all harmful mutations, defects, or injuries, and in general improves them massively and ridiculously so they become a true, absolute exemplar of their race.
* Across all time and dimensions the best versions of something, just imagine it, how advanced could a item become by the time the universe is dying and elder races are all that is left."
58,,400CP,Worthy Workshop ,Girl Genius SB,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"The tradesman needs the right tools, don't you know? More than that, they need the labs! You have a full set of labs, for chemical, biological, mechanical experiments, as well as any other kinds you might need. Abominable, perhaps?
These are some of the most elaborate, extensive laboratories and workshops in the world, with vast arrays of instruments and tools of the finest make, an unlimited supply of test subjects, and huge amounts of spare parts, reagents, books and journals... everything a spark needs to get going. You have just about any and all parts and reagents you might need, even things incredibly rare like water from the Dyne, and the absolute latest in all parts, of course.
Furthermore, any and all properties you have that can support them all develop similar labs and workshops, providing you a virtually unlimited collection of spaces to work from so you're never, ever left unable to tinker to your heart's content."
59,,600CP,A Hidden Base ,Arpeggio of Blue Steel,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This tropical island houses a secret facility with all the facilities of a modern shipyard: underground docks for submarines or other submersible craft to enter by, comfortable living quarters and rooms for planning operations, stockpiles of nanomaterials, an underground mine for extracting raw materials, and even a fantastic beach. While it seems idyllic, it is far from defenceless: concealed turrets, Klein field generators, missile tubes and more lie in wait for any attacker. Its defences can be overwhelmed eventually, however, so I wouldn't rely on them against a sophisticated foe. Expended consumables, like nanomaterials, resupply on a weekly basis. This island imports into a suitably remote position in a tropical ocean in each jump."
60,,600CP,Archology ,Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,You own a medium size archology that comes equipped with standard defenses and a Higgs generator as a power supply. The millions that call your arcology home live in a post-scarcity like state thanks to modern technology taking care of their essential needs. The arcology comes with an individual already synched to the Valkyrie Core at its heart who manages its everyday functions. If you also possess a simulator room or the high energy physics lab you may have them integrated into the arcology if you wish.
61,,600CP,Cybertronian Forge ,Transformers,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Somehow a good portion of your warehouse is now a mini cybertronian factory. This automatic factory prints out Cybertronium, a material that Transformers bodies are made out of. This is a room temperature superconductor and is the basis of all Cybertronian technology. It also functions as a 3D printer, but its programming is blank ready for input."
62,,600CP,Handy Workshop ,Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This Equipment Workshop provides you with the tools and materials needed to upgrade any equipment you have. However, you must have a well-defined, finite end goal for the equipment, and you need to be undisturbed while using it. Extensive goals require extensive amounts of time, and you might be better served looking for better materials than brute-forcing a far-reaching goal with limited materials.
You can only get materials that are duplicates of some you already have, in infrastructure or a system you already have, or just in storage or on your person. Other people using this only get the tools, not the free materials. Can be installed in your Warehouse or attached to an Imported property in future Jumps. If destroyed while Imported, reverts to being part of the Warehouse."
63,,600CP,Legion Fabrication Unit ,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"The end-point for many Genius' mass production needs is simply the beginning for you. This is a Wonder able to build other Wonders, a warehouse sized factory that accepts blueprints and raw materials and through the wonders of 3D printing, creates the finished product of whole cloth by the dozens per hour as long as it has the materials to use as a base. This facility comes with a default Air/Ground/Navy production of military automatons.
If you have Big Think they can be controlled by child AI of Big Think itself, at no risk to Big Think, to grant a huge upgrade in the self-automation of the automatons. Even better is the simplistic systems can be turned to another purpose. If the world has non-repeatable phenomena, such as magical devices in an otherwise non-magical world or technology so far beyond the norm as to be called 'extremely improbable', this system can analyze the structure and create a Wonder of roughly equal ability and function.
If you have A Correlation of Constants Between Physical Reality and Wondrous Artifice Creation then this ideal can be realized via the systems here as well. Allowing all Wonders created by this system to become simply mundane, though at a size and sudden need for fuel. For example a plasma pistol that could easily melt tank armored plate would find that it would need a massive battery and be around the size of an RPG."
64,,600CP,Manufactory ,Revelation Space,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"When lighthuggers and habitats need to repair themselves, the large-scale manufactories are where the parts are designed and produced. This manufactory is roughly on par with that of a well-to-do Glitter Band habitat, and on its own is the size of several skyscrapers packed tightly together. Running at peak efficiency, it's capable of assembling 1,000 tons of raw material into finished products per minute provided, of course, you have the right kinds of raw materials, correct blueprints to assemble them into, and a logistics chain to keep it all working smoothly. In the hands of an inefficient human, it might top out at 100 tons/minute. It is incapable of atomic transmutation and having to 'crack' raw matter into a different type will slow everything down a bit (eg: throwing in methane (CH4) to crack into carbon and hydrogen, when you need the carbon to make diamond, rather than using pure carbon to begin with). It is capable of producing nanotech (such as quickmatter) at a much smaller rate, owing to the processes involved. The Manufactory comes pre-installed with blueprints for just about any item in common use in Yellowstone space; you'll have to obtain prohibited or classified blueprints for yourself. You will have to manually configure and program it to work with any unusual materials."
65,,600CP,Omnium ,Overwatch,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"Oh, how interesting. You seem to have come into the possession of your own personal Omnium. These self-improving automated robotic factories are the source of the omnic population of the world and were very nearly the instrument of humanity's ruin during the first Crisis. You may have the factory create omnics for you as is its purpose, though you will need to supply the materials necessary for doing so. You may also fully customize the appearance, personality, intelligence level, and capabilities of your creations though if the specifications are too far removed from basic omnics, you will need to supply the necessary designs for them."
66,,600CP,Research Laboratory ,Warhammer 40k: T'au Empire,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"This Research Laboratory is is four stories high and covers about 100 acres of ground, and includes all of the most advanced mundane technologies of the T'au, with small sections being dedicated to various subfields in Physics, Materials Science, Chemistry, Biology, Engineering, and Computer Science, while still being modular in design and easily upgradeable or repurposed to various other fields. It will manage itself and churn out research into various mundane technologies on its own, though you can direct it to specific purposes, and will manage its own staffing, though you can hire or fire staff as you please (within limits, don't expect to hire an entire sept to work for this lab). But moreover, this laboratory has some unique properties. Firstly, no research you perform will result in catastrophic destruction, by accident or by sabotage. No nanobots you research here will result in a Grey Goo scenario, no virus will mutate into a global pandemic, no dinosaurs will be unleashed on the public as a staffer flees with their DNA. If such research would normally result in such an issue, your staff will find that their research just stalls, failing to progress at all but not resulting in harm. And secondly, if you deign to perform research in this laboratory personally, then you, and your staff, will find your research accelerated by an order of magnitude as research cycles blaze by and prototype units roll out of machine shops far more quickly than possible, so long as you personally spend at least 40 man-hours a week performing research of some kind, with lesser boosts available if you spend less time contributing to the labs productivity."
67,,600CP,Warchive ,Revelation Space,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"An ignorant fool would call the warchive an arsenal, 'a place to store weapons', as evidenced by the quantity of guns displayed on the walls of this room, but it's also so very much more. The warchive contains a coffin-sized fabricator and an advanced database containing every personal weapon that humanity has developed in this universe, in its thousands of years of violence. From a combat knife to an ack-am launcher to a camouflaged assassin's needler, this fabricator can not only manufacture any handheld weapon it has the schematics for, but it can also merge and customize their functions, appearances, programming and ergonomics to any user's vague, general or very specific requirements. It comes equipped with a knowledgeable gamma-level personality to interpret your requests and offer suggestions. You'll get to specify the personality, so you don't get annoyed by it. The warchive will automatically acquire the blueprints of any weapons you currently possess or acquire to add to its collection, with the stipulation that it cannot reproduce enchantments or other added magical effects, and you may have to supply a bit of raw material and some of the rarer components yourself (like antimatter or setting-specific materials like kryptonite, eezo or uru). The warchive takes up a room which may be placed in your warehouse, a large starship or another property. Naturally, you can restrict access to the warchive."
68,,600CP,Workshop of the Future ,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"What you could make if only you had the tools. It's a lamentation that you'll never find yourself making ever again. This absolute masterpiece of a workspace is large enough that even a megacorp wouldn't find it lacking, either in space or capability, capable of hosting every pursuit or project you care to imagine and often many of those at once. Most unique however is the impossibly nuanced automation that has been worked into it's countless systems and utilities. Even the most exacting genius or craftsman would find no reason to fault letting the systems here do the work for them, allowing them to focus entirely on pushing the boundaries and leaving grunt work to the machines. These systems effectively share your crafting skills and abilities including the effects of perks. If you've purchased the Augmentation Suite and/or Keys to the Matrix then they are seamlessly integrated, and with the Personal Arm Computer the entire sight could be managed trivially from it's interface. May be either an actual facility or attached to your warehouse. Comes with a limitless stock of raw materials and resources barring the truly extraordinary, same as the Augmentation Suite. Whatever tools or functions it lacks can easily be built with what is here if needed. Never suffer for tools again."
69,,800CP,UAC Mars Facility ,DOOM 3 V1.0,Domain: Facilities: Mundane ,"One of the most advanced scientific research stations in the solar system, the UAC's Mars facilities work on everything from energy production and terraforming to Archaeology and teleportation. It is one of the pinnacles of human achievement and now, it is yours. Or at least, a copy of it is - perhaps one far enough away from the original that it's safe from the coming demonic invasion?
Coming with a full complement of (mostly) competent staff as well as a wide variety of interesting technologies, the facility now operates under your command. Whether you decide to take a more active hand in their research or simply leave them to their own interests, they're guaranteed to come up with interesting ideas over time - usually in areas involving physics, weapons development, and so on. In future worlds, you'll likewise become the owner of a large, productive center of scientific learning, though it doesn't need to be on Mars as such."
