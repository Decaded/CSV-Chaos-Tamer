1,,100CP,Ceph Technology Free,Crysis,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Within this small vial is a delicate sample of a Ceph commander unit, once active but now 'dead'. The
nanomachinery is still active at some level, but it acts without intelligence nor connection to the Ceph
hivemind, making it relatively safe to handle. It's not exactly a gold mine of every possible Ceph
technology, but studying it can yield tremendous advances."
2,,100CP,Cultural Crafting: Elf,Queens Blade,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"You are now expertly trained in the primary crafts of your people. You could easily make a living off of
your respective trade."
3,,100CP,Cultural Crafting: Dwarf,Queens Blade,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"You are now expertly trained in the primary crafts of your people. You could easily make a living off of
your respective trade."
4,,200CP,0-D for Dummies,Megas XLR,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"A set of textbooks that explains the basic of Hyper-dimensional structure, most potent in making spaces
with overlapping existences in layman terms, use tech in making spaces and parts that don't exist in real
space. Warning! Extremely energy intensive."
5,,200CP,Ancient Knowledge Database,Stargate Atlantis,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Not interested in buying a Lantean City Ship or infiltrating Atlantis itself to get your hands on all that
wonderful science? This small server farm (the size of an olympic swimming pool) will be placed in your
Cosmic Warehouse or other property of your choice with the appropriate power and network hookups.
Don't expect to start churning out ZPMs just by buying this; first you'll have to sift through what is
basically the Ancient scientific equivalent of our Internet - only instead of being a few mere decades
worth of information produced by a people who've barely gotten off their first rock, this database holds
tens of thousands of years of information collected by an entire intergalactic civilisation."
6,,200CP,Unusual Talent Perk,Monster Girl Quest,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Everyone needs a hobby, even a hero! You happen to be abnormally skilled at yours. Pick one profession
and one related skill such as an innkeeper and math, you would be able to impress even Promestein with
your abilities of simple factorization. Sadly, this does not help you in combat or sex but it does act as a
very impressive party trick and can be useful for certain things like bookkeeping."
7,,200CP,CRAFT Mind Files,Limitless,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"You have copies of mind files from all the leading minds of CRAFT, complete with uncanny valley-esque
holographic heads, informationally replicating their knowledge. These can never be stolen or corrupted,
and each jump you can receive additional mind files and holographic heads for the premier scientists of
the jump. Just keep in mind that the software running them does a middling poor job of replicating
personalities."
8,,200CP,Extremis Formula,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Another attempt at creating super soldiers, this formula creates a virus that can enhance a person to
superhuman strength, reflexes, and endurance. Additionally, normal Extremis users gain the ability to
generate extreme amounts of heat through a complex metabolic process, generating heat from their
bodies up to several thousand degrees Celsius on any part of the body they desire. When regenerating
body parts, the wounds take on the appearance of burning ashes while growing back the lost body part,
in a matter of minutes, and cooling into regular skin, flesh, and bone. Be wary however, as this makes
you light up on thermal sensors, and should your body heat up too much, you may end up exploding.
Keep this in mind."
9,,200CP,N-Ways Fusion Plant,Endless Space,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Refueling? What's that? You have mastered the art of Endless power generation, and any device you
possess or can claim as yours never runs out of power. Other things can still be a problem, like weapons
overheating, engines breaking down, etc, but you never need to worry about your battery running out.
Your starting equipment and ship already have fusion plants installed in them, and you have schematics
to make more, of various sizes, but you will need some rare elements and facilities to make them. The
smaller they are, the simpler it is. Making a capital ship reactor is going to take a LOT of materials, but is
totally worth it."
10,,200CP,Primordial Schematics,Necron Jump SB Edition 1.0,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"The human world of Cadia was able to stymie the advance of Chaos largely due to the efforts of Necron
technology. The mysterious pylons of Cadia acted to reinforce the materium even on the verge of the Eye
of Terror. During the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the Archmagos Belisarius Cawl was even able to use them
to shrink the largest Warp Storm in the galaxy. The designs behind this priceless technology are now
within your possession. Outside of this setting, pylons designed according to the specifications of these
schematics will disrupt interdimensional portals and incursions with some fine-tuning."
11,,200CP,Secrets of the Sacred Forge,Scooby Gamers,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"A skill book that teaches the Secrets of the Sacred Forge skill, but is destroyed when used up. A new one
appears in the Warehouse each month, or if you have a personal inventory you may choose to have it
appear there instead. Anyone can use this even if they normally couldn't."
12,,200CP,Strange Formula | Nitrimine,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Strange Formula (100CP) This chemical formula is the brainchild of the German scientist Dr. Erskine, and
is directly responsible for the creation of Captain America. As is, this is only the formula, and you must
make it yourself... but as a result it could possibly let you modify the serum for other uses. Beware its
tendencies to amplify the personality traits of the user, or be prepared to find a way to fix that fact.
Nitrimine (100CP) The formula for the chemical compound known as Nitramene, this compound has multiple purposes. A typical Nitramene bomb has a blast radius of five hundred yards after which it creates a vacuum that causes an implosion as matter rushes to fill the void that it has created, but a grenade of that size will do considerably less damage. On the other hand, Nitramene also emits low levels of Vita Radiation, which has a specific wavelength that has stabilizing properties."
13,,200CP,Technical Schematics,Warhammer 40k - T'au empire,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"This small database is a well organized, easily searchable, and easily accessible list of detailed schematics
and scientific texts covering all machines, tools, and sciences understood by the T'au. It cannot be
remotely hacked or externally corrupted by others. During your jump, this database includes all T'au
knowledge up to either current 40k canon or all information that would be available to the T'au within
the next hundred years without your interference, whichever option includes less advanced technology.
After this jump, the schematics are upgraded to include all designs and science your T'au have developed
and all designs and science developed in canon by the T'au by the end of the Fifth Sphere Expansion."
14,,200CP,Vitrium notes,Trinity: Aberrant,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"A synthetic crystal that can be spun and blown like glass while being mechanically as strong as steel at a
quarter of the weight, colored or transparent as desired. But every object made of Vitrium has a unique
resonant frequency that if hit at sufficient intensity will cause it to shatter like a crystal wineglass.
Perhaps these notes discarded by Vitrium's creator can help you perfect the material?"
15,,300CP,RobCo Holotapes,Fallout 4,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"A series of Holotapes detailing the blueprints for numerous Robco projects, including Protectrons,
Assaultrons, Securitrons, and the various models of Pip-Boys. There's even a group of Holotapes
detailing Liberty Prime's systems and construction. These Holotapes seem to be more advanced than the
standard kind, and therefore there are only a few rather than the hundreds this amount of information
would normally take up."
16,,300CP,The Codex,Uber,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"The entirety of the mysterious work of unknown origin that enabled Project U in the first place. To this
date only a minor portion has been deciphered. The first chapter does provide instructions to decoding
the rest based on universal mathematical principles. After that it consists of three main sections. The
first contains instructions to produce the catalyst, the second describes a possible way to locate people
susceptible to the upgrade process and has as of yet been untranslated, the third details the separate
ways of upgrading humans. Even with the instructions provided the confusing manner passages are
structured, combined with the interwoven philosophical treatises and the fact that there seem to be
thousands of ways to decode the passages to slightly different results it will take months to decipher a
single passage of a relevant length. This item does not come with the already translated passages."
17,,400CP,Space Is Like This Piece Of Paper',Generic Space Opera,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"you see. We three dimensional beings have to walk along its surface to get from this point on the one
side to this one on the other. This Drive however, will do this! ...Why yes I did need to stab the blueprints
with a pen to get my point across what do you mean you are all scientists? - Blueprints and schematics
instructing the construction, installation and maintenance of various methods of faster than light travel.
Included are instructions on how to upgrade several types of those drives to be able to travel between
Jumps in addition to their normal capabilities, though they require a Spark to be completed. Lastly you
can fold this blueprint and stab it with a pen to make even a caveman understand the concept of
wormholes. The paper will return to pristine condition the next time it is unobserved. Pen not included."
18,,400CP,Animate Library,MtG - Bablovia,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"A living library containing all sorts of Bablovian wisdom and science. The library is a loyal servant which
obeys your every command. It gets stronger with every book in it, but will never get stronger than you
are. The spirit animating the library can be transported to any library or collection of books you own."
19,,400CP,Ageless Talent,World of Lewd Elves,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Much of a younger elf’s life is spent meticulously mastering a skill, focusing every day for years on
improving their performance with an intensity that would baffle most humans. But such diligence pays
off well as many elves are considered to be the undisputed masters in whatever field they study in.
Choose a skill that you have studied and practiced for most of your lifetime to the point of mastery. An
elven alchemist would have a vast knowledge of potions and medicines with a countless variety of
effects. An elven archer could hit perfect bullseye at ranges that a normal human would balk at, while an
elf swordmaster could fight many foes at once with a grace and lethality that would baffle the average
fighter. (Tech&Mechanic related)*Other skills will be available in other Constellations"
20,,400CP,Antibody Creation,Cells at Work,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Preparation is the key to victory, and now, you can prepare a solution to any enemy you face. A solution
in the chemical sense, anyway. You now know how to synthesize a special liquid that can be attuned to a
specific enemy, acting like an acid on them when they are exposed to it. You can modulate how potent of
an effect it has, from dissolving away at them, to merely giving burns, to even just targeting their clothes
and equipment. This liquid does take some time to make, generally around half an hour to an hour, but it
can go much quicker if you have access to some DNA or other similar chemical identifiers. With time and
experimentation, you may find out how to have other effects aside from just acid, such as knocking them
unconscious or sealing away their abilities for a time.
Premade Solutions (w/ Lucky Defender): You now have the ability to create special 'blank' solutions,
which are apparently unattuned to any given enemy. However, when you carry these 'blank' solutions
with you, and you get drawn in to face a surprise enemy, you'll find that they are attuned specially to
that enemy. You'll have to make more 'blank' solutions afterward, as all prior made 'blank' solutions
would have been attuned specifically to that surprise enemy."
21,,400CP,Archive,Artemis Fowl,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Whoa, access to the Council's black archives! Well, not exactly, but close. This is a digital archive in your
possession, and what it holds is technology. That is, all of it. Every single piece of technology, from the
wheel onwards to the most advanced stuff under the earth, has it's schematics, developer's notes and
blueprints stored here, explained clearly and obviously enough that simply following the instructions
would let someone built it all up.
There is everything here, from the People's works to Humanity's designs. Every program ever written,
every microchip ever designed, the whole sum total of human and fairy technical knowledge. In future
worlds too, it updates to hold the same level of detail on the local technology, everything ever crafted in
the world."
22,,400CP,Biotransference Protocols,Necron Jump SB Edition 1.0,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Behold, the designs that were meant to secure the salvation of the Necrontyr, and instead cost them
their souls. These schematics contain two things of note: the first is the Necrodermis shells of the
Necrons and their constructs, from the lowliest Warriors and Scarabs to the greatest Tomb Sentinels.
Secondly, they teach the method of biotransference itself, transitioning an organic mind into a body of
metal. Will you use these designs to create a robotic army to put the Men of Iron to shame? Or will you
use them to secure immortality?"
23,,400CP,Capsule Calamity,Dragon Ball,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"This is a patented prize of the Capsule Corporation, able to store incredibly large and unwieldy objects in
light, easy-to-use capsules. You now know how to make such capsules and store things up to the size of a
small house in a single one. You can even 're-equip' things to said capsules once you're done using them.
How handy is that?"
24,,400CP,Computation Technologies,Generic Cyberpunk,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"An Artificial intelligence isn't constrained by the need for food or water, but by the need for power and
processors. You have in your possession the designs and documentation for computing technologies that
are the peak of what a world like this can offer. Easily scale-able to whatever your needs or desires are,
produced for either general or specialized uses, these are easily adapted to handle whatever you require
and will remain applicable and top of the line for decades to the envy of others who might want
technology like this. Why be limited to what the market can provide for you when you can have the best."
25,,400CP,Factorio Database,Factorio,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"A bulky data storage device containing the blueprints and software needed to construct and run all of
Factorio's machines, weapons, buildings, and vehicles."
26,,400CP,Full Storage,Modded Fallout,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"This old, half-broken Pip-Boy seems to be incapable of even starting its operating system, the diagnostics
indicating that the entirety of its vast 64k RAM is already in use. Most people might simply discard it or
strip it for spare parts, but a closer look will reveal the exact reason for its fault: its internal database has
been crammed full of Fallout design specs, schematics, scientific principles and so on. How full, you ask?
Well, it's got just about every semi-common piece of Fallout tech in there somewhere, from Laser Rifle
schematics to Assaultron software and Berry Mentat formulations to Power Armor designs. Though
mainly limited to the kind of technologies one could have found in the Pre-War world of old, a number
of designs that were only finalized in the two centuries following the apocalypse can also be found here
(such as the Hydra drug, the Enclave's X-01 and Hellfire armor designs, and the Radium Rifle). Though
you'll still need a way to actually build all of these things, this database is nonetheless one of the most
spectacular treasures scavvers could find."
27,,400CP,Leonardo da Vinci's Journal,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"An artifact from the time now known as the Renaissance, these works of a man who was part of one of
the great movements of humanities Mania can be seen evidenced in everything around the modern era,
however the most well known by far is those artifacts crafted, drawn, drafted, and painted by one
Leonardo da Vinci. He was not the greatest of his age in anything singular but his ideas are the stuff of
modern legend and looking at the devices he worked on one could see the raw, unrefined principles he
was working with.
This journal is a work akin to that great man's works which explains all the internally consistent ideas of
your Aesthetic, written in a way that the journal contains the element of Leonardo's genius that allowed
him to translate his ideas to others so well. By reading this journal anyone, even a Mere Mortal, would
treat the Aesthetic in question as if it were normal science, 'getting around' the worst Havok. If you
somehow have (Not so) Consistent Technology you instead have a single Journal per Aesthetic you've
used, in a trunk that always seems to have enough room inside it just one more Journal, no matter the
number already within, however the person affected by this item must read it through, not memorize it
but at least once cover to cover, in order for the benefits to kick."
28,,400CP,Perfect Body,Andromeda,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"You are in possession of a fully functioning and programmed to your specifications android body with
appearance to your liking. This is more Sturdy than a standard avatar, it has been built with the best
Vedran technology. Built to survive the horrors of the post Commonwealth society, and with blueprints
to make more. This body can be upgraded if you know how and keeps upgrades in-between jumps. You
can choose for this to be used as a free android companion."
29,,400CP,Professor T.O. Morrow's Notes,Young Justice,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"These notes detail the creation of the Red series of androids, including Red Torpedo, Red Inferno, Red
Tornado, and Red Volcano, as well as designs for androids that resemble actual people."
30,,400CP,Recipe codex,Unmodded Minecraft,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Summoned to hand or dismissed with a thought, this book records every Minecraft recipe that exists
within the game. Post-jump, the book will update with every blueprint, chemical process or recipe you
create or learn. Whenever you lay hands on a new type of material, the book will update itself with a
detailed analysis of its mechanical properties. While the book only records what you know and cannot
create new designs, it can extrapolate from existing knowledge and make suggestions when you need to
make modifications or substitutions to existing blueprints."
31,,400CP,Sentinel Plans,X-Men Evolution,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"How on earth did you get these? The prototype isn't meant to be finished until almost a year passes.
Regardless these are Bolivar Task's plans to even out the mutant playing field with a mass producible
robot. The sentinel as it is called is capable of many things ranging from firing lasers, flight to the
atmosphere, and has a gel substance which will trap most mutants. It seems like there are even plans for
something called a Super Sentinel but with current technology its almost impossible to complete. Maybe
you'll be the first to bring it in then."
32,,400CP,Stark's Blueprints,The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Perhaps thanks to a bit of corporate espionage, you now have blueprints for pretty much everything that
Tony Stark has ever built (with the exception of things built off world or with the help of others, such as
the Uru armor or the Magic Nullifier). Includes his suits, his Arc Reactor technology, and the Quinjets."
33,,400CP, The Art and Science,Draka Series,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"You now have a complete technical database of every scientific and technological development that has
been produced by either the Alliance or the Domination, all the way up to the interstellar era of 'Drakon'.
This database will update in future jumps to add in a complete archive of all local technology or magic,
up to the latest time period available for the Jumper to insertinton. As a convenience feature, the
database has an intuitive search engine that makes finding anything you're looking for a snap."
34,,400CP,The Anything OS,The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"This is a 'perfect' operating system for any computer. It's compatible with every form of software that
exists, runs faster than anything that'll develop in the next hundred years or so, and has no weak points.
In general this system is the greatest piece of software that can exist. Updates anytime there is software
greater than it to be in the average top ten percentile of the local software. Never downgrades."
35,,400CP,Training Packets,Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"The form of this depends on the world you're in. It could be a chest full of books, or a briefcase full of
manila folders, or a flash drive full of documents. Whatever it is, it contains documents for training
anyone in how to use any of your technology or systems. These documents take no more than six hours
to read, switch to the best-understood language of whoever is reading them, and give perfect
understanding to the reader. They will be able to implement and perform the tasks described in the
manuals perfectly. Respawns in a week."
36,,400CP,Wraith Data Device,Stargate Atlantis,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"A Wraith data storage device, with an adaptor for human computers. It contains everything you ever
wanted to know about Wraith technology but were too afraid to ask. The sheer volume of data deals
more with theory rather than engineering practice (eg: you might find the technical explanation on how
the Wraith beaming tech works, but not the schematics to build one straight away)"
37,,500CP,Engineer's Notes: Avvenire,ARIA,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"A last set of documents that was kept in the archives. This copy seems to have been fragmented into
components, though as you compile more of it together it will become evidently that this details the
specifics of the actual terraforming process, including the equipment and calculations involved in the
process of creating Aqua. It does go to note that while the knowledge stored within this could help a
new engineer tackle a different terraforming project, each planet presents its own challenges, and this
information is better taken as a sample of notes rather than a hard guideline.
Each time you take this option your own abilities at controlling the logistic and engineering elements of
terraforming improves slightly, though with ten purchases you'll find that the documents will be
complete further purchases won't help you much unless you had a different use for them.
* (The doc seemed to have a nonworking link for the use)
* Included all 10 buy options in the above price"
38,,500CP,The Plecian Tome,Light of Terra,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"The Pleician Tome is a portable font of certain archives, templates and pieces of ancient lore, created by
a senior Tech-priest of the Adeptus Mechanicus and used by Techmarines. Even to a trained eye, the
information is a seemingly random collection, with no easy means of navigation, and so it takes much
study to glean anything relevant to a particular task. Indeed, only those with a wide knowledge of
Machine Spirits and engine lore have any hope of understanding the information contained within,
however, those with patience and the appropriate skills can find secrets of great use within the datacore,
secrets dating back to the fabled Dark Age of Technology."
39,,600CP,Adoption Papers,World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"This is something that can't be, yet is. Brought to you by a friend to your 'in' at 'some cost' clearing up
'some debt'. A blueprint of a work you've never put together but still it is in your style with no error. A
reposed wonder three-hundred years ahead of it's time written out in gross detail through an
accompanying journal allows you to fit all the pieces together, all you'll need to do is put it together. The
finished product is a simple microchip that houses an AI. The true glory of this invention is the fact that
the Ai itself is Inspired and because of its programming always has a decent obligation to humanity. By
inserting this technology into any willing mere mortal they will act as if they themselves had been
Inspired, though not with the potential for growth that you have, never causing Havoc and even able to
create Wonders."
40,,600CP,"Aperture Science Technology | Conversion Gel recipe | Repulsion Gel recipe | Repulsion Gel recipe
| Unexplained Science Thing",Portal,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Conversion Gel recipe (100CP) This is a recipe for Aperture's Conversion Gel, which makes any surface it
coats able to conduct a portal. More importantly, it's a huge improvement over Aperture's current bankbraking
recipe. Ground up rocks from any object considered a moon will work, mixed with the recipe for
especially thick Jello. Washes off with water.
Repulsion Gel recipe (200CP) This is a recipe for Aperture's Repulsion Gel, a blue liquid which repulses
anything which touches it. Other names include that bouncy stuff, the blue gel, and unknown skeletonhating
element. Unlike Aperture's current expensive and lengthy recipe, this one involves precisely
combining rubber with hydrogen and oxygen. Blue dye is optional. Washes off with water. Why is this
recipe so expensive? Repulsion Gel can be used as a potent weapon against anything mobile that relies
on solid structural integrity by covering that thing in the Gel. It will repulse any movement back in the
other direction, creating a movement which is then repulsed in the other direction by the Gel covering
the other size of that thing. One twitch becomes movement in every direction at terminal velocity,
tearing that thing apart. This includes the human body.
Propulsion Gel recipe (100CP) This is a recipe.. Okay, you get the picture. The acceleration gel is created
by adding seemingly random elements to a modern recipe for no-stick spray. The gel increases the
velocity of any object moving on it unless that object is at rest. Washes off with water
Unexplained Science Thing (200CP) You have no idea what this thing does. No idea at all! It could have
the effect of any one of Aperture's miscellaneous inventions depending on how you try to use it. Shape
the ill-defined mass into the shape of a disk and put it in a computer? You've discovered the annotated
source code for Aperture's OS, able to run an AI on the power from a potato battery. Disperse it into an
air vent and record the results? You now have the ability to convert type AB blood into pure gasoline
with laser technology. There's only enough Unexplained Science Thing for it to be a single one of
Aperture's innovations not already listed here. Choose wisely!"
41,,600CP,Apollo's Odyssey,Horizon Zero Dawn V0.9a,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Supposedly destroyed by an antimatter explosion in orbit, somehow the Odyssey's copy of Apollo has
ended up in your possession. This cache of information contains all the knowledge the Old Ones were
able to salvage before the collapse, and attaches to your warehouse, although is accessible through any
connected device."
42,,600CP,Ancient Human,Hypno App Fantasia,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Unless you’ve been thrown forward in time a thousand years, you might just be impossible. The long
thought of lost science of the ancient world, a time when vast companies ruled the planet and competed
with armies of bioweapons and magic-like technology, has been encoded into your brain. The skills and
studies necessary to recreate all kinds of relics is yours, technology so advanced it
surpasses what even magic can do in this world. God like AI, satellite cannons, tools to manipulate space
and time or alter the fabric of reality. Of course, you’re not going to be making much in this fantasy land
of country bumpkins. This technology was the result of globe spanning corporations and the resources
they had at their disposal, meaning it’ll require a lot from you to start really getting to work. Repairing,
altering or upgrading existing relics you find is much more feasible and getting in contact with any of the
Goddesses could show you to some of the vaults of sealed away technology."
43,,600CP,Bioid Blueprints,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Oh dear. Vilgax won't be happy to find out someone stole his idea. These are blueprints for massproducing
an army of featureless androids with very basic AI. Their true power comes from the one
commanding them, however...once synchronized to a commander (presumably you) they will transform
to match you in body and DNA, becoming an army with your own abilities spread among them. Even
better, if you have some way to synchronize them to a larger database, they can change into any existing
DNA within said database. Considering all you have seen up to this point, you can see why such an army
would be fearsome and able to conquer the universe, no? Be warned, if cut off from this network, these
Bioids change back to normal and become harmless...so try to protect wherever they're getting it from."
44,,600CP,Bowman's Schematics,Freefall,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Using these plans, you could make learning AIs (though not seed AI) that are guaranteed to never go evil
or try to take over. By following the instruction and diagrams even a layperson with only a very basic
degree of construction skills, intelligence and the needed materials can make any of the AIs that Dr
Bowman made in canon. This can also aid you if you an understanding of how to create other variations:
it can be used not just for Planet Jean-style robots and Bowman's Wolves, but for other creations
whether they are completely inorganic, organic, cyborgs, infomorphs, or really any other form you can
build. For largely organic creations, Exo-Womb may be a good purchase. The only problem you might
have is that they categorically refuse to fight any human. AI created with Bowman's Schematics not only
won't harm a human by choice, they can't be hacked to do so. If someone or something successfully
controls them, they could perhaps steal the robots monetary resources or perhaps damage them
directly, but as soon as a human is in danger the hacker/controller will fail. I'm sure an enterprising
person could find uses regardless of that."
45,,600CP,Building Better Worlds,Aliens vs Predator,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"It seems you've got a lot of proprietary secrets packed away in that skull of yours; Weyland Yutani has its
fingers in many pies, after all. All of that proprietary technology is resting at your fingertips: Atmospheric
Processing Stations that can turn a barren, unbreathable moon into a world that humans can survive and
thrive on. Starship drives that can punch through the speed of light to deliver passengers and cargo from
distant worlds in a fraction of the time speed of light transports would take. Androids that are
indistinguishable, in appearance and behaviour to humans, yet superior in almost every way. And lastly,
genetic experimentation data collected from across inhabited space; enough to get you started should
you need to modify a certain newly-discovered breed. All this and more are the tools at your command.
Build a better world."
46,,600CP,Dark Science Index,Honkai Impact Third,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"This is it, the dark science index in all of its cataloged glory. This has 666 inventions stored inside of its
databanks. Many of which are worthless or incredibly situational, but if you take your time to comb
through the whole index you can find there may be quite a few gems of absurdity that you just may be
able to recreate or improve using this as your guide"
47,,600CP,Derelict Ship,DCEU,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"An additional ship from Krypton that arrived alongside the one that brought Superman to Earth. This
ship has long since been abandoned, perhaps never even having a living pilot, and the systems relating
to weaponry and movement have long since been irrevocably destroyed. However, it seems the ship was
a science vessel and it retains an in depth database on almost all Kryptonian technology that existed.
Weaponry, ships, armour, genetics and more are within the databanks here, governed by a friendly
Artificial Intelligence that will assist you in learning all that is stored here."
48,,600CP,Flask Plan Data,Medaka Box Abnormal,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"The jewel of Hakoniwa Academy or at least what they hope will one day be that jewel. This USB contains
all the data so far accumulated by the Flask Plan and a fair bit more on top. A project created in order to
one day turn Normals into Abnormals, these are the starting steps towards successfully completing that
plan. Given the creators of the plan's true origins, there'd be no hope of succeeding at all without having
this in hand and yet even with it, you're still in for an arduous road of study, experimentation and a lot of
expended resources. But when you've managed to bottle the essence of Gods, it'll all be worth it."

might be. Richesians are masters of miniaturization, and are able to make machines up to a hundred
times smaller than they should be without losing any effectiveness. Ixians are experts in non-digital
programming, able to create non-computerized machines capable of replicating almost anything a
computer can do besides think for itself."
50,,600CP,Full Coalition Database,Invincible,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"You gain a full Coalition of Planets database that adapts to be readable on any computer or similar
device. Contained in this database is a copy of every piece of information every developed by the
Coalition or any of their member races. This includes space tech, medical knowledge, history, and even
the most classified of military secrets. It even holds the knowledge of how to make tailored superplagues
of killing off specific species with zero chance of mutation or the plague affecting an undesired
species, in addition to the creation of lesser diseases."

Contained in this database is a copy of every piece of information ever developed by the Viltrumites or
any of their slave races. This includes space tech, medical knowledge, history, and even the most
classified of military secrets. It even holds the new invention of how to cure species specific super
plagues, and lesser diseases"
52,,600CP,GitD Virus 2.0,Freefall,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"With this you have a selective killer. Before unleashing the program somewhere that it can access the
offending AIs, you may designate parameters as to which to ignore, harmlessly disable, selectively
damage, and which to utterly destroy. This item's effects start out as strong as the canonic virus, but
scale up the greater your abilities, hardware used, knowledge of software, and knowledge of target."
53,,600CP,Guide to Super Tech Theory,Justice League Unlimited,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"This is some seriously dangerous stuff you're holding on to. These innocent looking books contain
detailed information on the final project of the brilliant Professor Ivo, they explain a new type of
nanotechnology that seems to combine several different branches of engineering, biology, and various
other scientific fields in a way that should be impossible! With some extensive study you can figure out
how to replicate this nanotech and create equipment capable of emulating supernatural powers from
any source, be it magical, scientific, alien, anything! This science isn't exactly perfect however as you'll
have to figure out the power in question before you can copy it, and that's not taking into account how
to implement such a power, but that's just the natural progression of super science. If you study hard
enough you'll eventually be able to recreate Ivo's ultimate achievement, the ever evolving android
known as AMAZO, an artificial being capable of instantly replicating the skills, abilities, equipment, and
other properties of any living being it scans."
54,,600CP,IS Lab | Personal IS | IS Education and Training,Infinite Stratos,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"IS Lab (600CP) A state of the art and top secret laboratory cross-manufacturer of your very own. While
this can certainly accomplish a wide variety of uses as either a lab or a customisable factory to mass
produce machines, it's true worth lies in the detailed Infinite Stratos blueprints and instructions that
come already inserted into the computers and machines within the lab. This makes this possibly the only
place outside of Tabane's personal lab capable of producing IS, as well as one of the very few places that
can effectively alter or customize them.
Personal IS (0CP) All players get a free Infinite Stratos Mecha personalized to them. See the Infinite
Stratos section after the Item section for details on how to create this mecha
IS Education and Training (0CP) The Infinite Stratos are terribly complicated things. It takes a lot of
knowledge on mathematics and various sciences to operate one and even more to maintain the
machines. That's not even getting into the trained reflexes and coordination you need to be able to use
an IS for effective combat. Usually you'd learn this over time in school but as a special consideration,
you'll have all that knowledge and skill popped into your head, free of charge. You won't be matching an
Ace but you can be assured of being proficient.
Build your own Infinite Stratos in the Jump Document. The options are half the jump document and not
copied here as a result."
55,,600CP,Jumper Asteroid,Justice League Unlimited,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Located deep within a treacherous asteroid field, this intimidating extraterrestrial base is a replica of the
secret fortress used by the super intelligent kryptonian A.I known as Brainiac. Although it's much smaller
than the original this space station is still comparable to the Watchtower in terms of size and internal
space and it's built in such a way that a single A.I can operate the facility by itself. While the exterior
doesn't have any noticeable features, aside from maybe a gigantic image of your face carved into the
rock, the interior houses a large hanger bay, numerous defensive drones, an imposing throne room, and
a massive digital library containing information on the culture, history, inhabitants, and technology of
over a hundred worlds, including krypton.
If someone were to study all the archives in this station they would gain incredible insights into robotics,
cybernetics, energy weaponry, space travel, A.I, and many other topics from countless space faring
civilizations. Enough to build weapons and starships that can pose a serious threat to Earth and
Apokolips.
Additionally this station contains a small fragment of Brainiac itself. The fragment is currently inactive
and safe to handle, and while it would be possible for a smart enough individual to reverse engineer
Brainiac's most powerful technology from this thing it would come at the cost of possibly awaking the
copy of the A.I hidden inside and If that were to happen it would quickly attempt to possess whoever or
whatever was nearby to ensure it's continued survival, replication, and improvement.
However someone would have to be as smart as Lex Luthor in order to even have a chance of
reactivating this device. If you do manage to get it working however then you'll have a sample of the
nanotech Brainiac uses to modify and possess living beings and assimilate alien technology. Aside from
replicating the nanotech in this fragment you could also purposefully reawaken the copy of Brainiac
stored within and try to use it for your own ends, but this really isn't recommended since it's a crazy
murderous A.I that's only interesting in collecting knowledge. If you do manage to reawaken Brainiac it
won't count as a companion.
* Braniac fragment is a part of this perk"
56,,600CP,Library of the Lost,The Games We Play,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Before the current setup rolled around, there were plenty of attempts by people to set up the whole
'civilization' thing. Vedic was an attempt, as were several others, mirroring nations you might recognize
from your original world in strange ways. They all had their own discoveries and knowledge, potentially
priceless things that were all lost nonetheless, to the relentless march of the Grimm. Not anymore,
though. This is a complete, comprehensive collection of all the lost knowledge in the world! Anything
that's lost to the world, through the destruction of a civilization, no one speaking the language, or other
mishaps, can be found here, explained clearly and plainly, ready to be brought back. This covers
everything from martial skills, scientific knowledge to cultural details like Art and the rest. But again, only
things that are specifically not in circulation in any real capacity in the modern day and age. Things like
the protection skills Jaune acquired from the Mistral libraries can be found here, hunter training
methods in active use can't. If this needs to be said at this point, yes, this updates with the equivalent
knowledge in all future jumps.
* Interestingly this is not limited to the planet, it covers every lost civ in the universe or possibly the local
multiverse."
57,,600CP,Organic Database,Starcraft - The Zerg,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"It's a large, shell-encased... brain. The various wrinkles and lines within it seem to glimmer with green
light, and aside from that it seems to be just odd. Within this brain, however, lies everything a growing
leader of the Zerg could need to know: The genetic make-up and growth patterns of every Zerg organism
ever, from the patterns of evolution that have resulted in the Zergling to the monolithic Leviathans used
for inter-plane- tary travel.
* Overmind is a zerg organism and so are primals and hybrids so this has the info for all of them too."
58,,600CP,PDA | Master Builder,Subnautica,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"PDA (0CP) Loaded with an emergency intelligence and more data capacity than you could ever use, this
is a survivor's second most powerful tool (after his or her brain.) The AI may get a bit . . . quirky . . . over
long deployments. Your version is basically indestructible. Contains basic construction blueprints.
Master Builder (600CP) Your PDA gains immediate access to all the blueprints available in Subnautica, as
well as a few that can't normally be found. These unique structures are: Ultrasonic Fencing, which ward
away hostile wildlife; Hydrogen balloons and a submersible dock for when the hurricanes sweep
through; Hydrogen-Fusion plants, which produces extreme energy from seawater; and finally, a robotics
bay where you can manufacture automated scavenger bots."
59,,600CP,R&D Tech Database,Mass Effect Andromeda,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"You gain access to a database with technology data from the Milky Way. This encompasses a wide variety
of fields, from A to Z. Alternatively, you could instead have a similar database encompassing Heleus
Cluster civilizations (excluding Remnant Tech). You could also pay an additional 100CP to get both Milky
Way and Heleus databases. If you've already bought both of those, you can also pay an additional 200CP
for access to a sprawling library of Remnant tech, enough to make Peebee swear eternal servitude to
you just to have access to it. If you pay an additional 200CP on top of the Remnant tech option, this
database will update per each civilization you interact with. Dead or remnant civilizations will take a bit
of a research period before you get an update for them, but when you do, you'll be the envy of any
archeological expert in that civilization. But regardless of whatever level you buy, you have a
media/cultural/historical archive of each culture/civilization you have the technology of. The
dead/remnant civilizations still need to be researched first though.
* The 600cp cost includes all the upgrades"
60,,600CP,Timespinner Blueprints,Timespinner,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"The blueprints and schematics for the device known as the Timespinner. It is a form of temporal gateway
that is capable of precisely sending a user through time into the past or future. The ordinary version has
several limitations, the most important of which is that travelling through it is a one-way trip, and results
in the removal of the traveller from history, leaving them as a person without a history on the other side.
Similarly, until upgraded by Lachiemi science, the portal only allowed for travel through time, not space,
and would deposit the user at the same point, relative to the planet they are on, in whatever era they
targeted.
This version has altered those restrictions. Firstly, it is capable of travelling through both space and time.
Secondly, it has a recall function, which allows a user who has travelled through it to 'snap back' to the
device the moment after they went through, re-entering their old timeline at that point.
The device does still retain the restriction that the timeline being travelled to will be one where the user
never existed, but the recall function means that they can travel between that timeline and this one as
they please. The third restriction is related to that, namely that this device can only target a single 'new'
timeline per person per Jump, and thus that as they travel around in the new timeline and make
changes, they will be making changes to the same timeline, even when they shift back and forth
between the old and new timelines.
It is possible to bring back objects from the new timeline into the old timeline, or vice versa, but not
people. Finally, this Timespinner has safeguards to ensure that no matter how much you mess with time,
it will not cause an existential breakdown or destroy the universe (which could be a danger with the
normal Timespinner, or that might just be a lie told by the Sandman). This purchase does come with the
necessary materials to make a single Timespinner, which will replenish at the beginning of each new
Jump. A Timespinner can only target times and spaces within the current Jump.
* Worse than the tardis but the protection feature is unique"
61,,600CP,Tinker Data Core,Worm,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"A computer containing a database of Tinker-Tech, including documentation, analysis, and blueprints.
There's enough information here to advance science centuries should everything in here get properly
examined and reverse engineered, although doing so would be the work of a lifetime or two. Still
enough to keep a company several years ahead of its competitors for a very long time. This doesn't
include all such tech in the Wormverse by any means, but barring some extraordinary effort or
circumstances on your part it's the closest you'll ever get."
62,,800CP,Amazo's Backup Memory,Young Justice,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"This memory stick contains the encrypted memories of the android Amazo, and more importantly,
contains the information on how the android replicated the abilities of the Justice League. After breaking
the encryption you will have all the information you need to incorporate superhuman abilities you
possess into your technology, creating machines that speak to each other with telepathy, process
information with super speed, lift great weights with actual super strength and more."
63,,800CP,Archives,Doctor Who,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Man, if word of this got out... anyway, this is a small technological database holding some... knowledge.
Massive, impossible amounts of knowledge, all stored in a tiny little thing like this... Okay, so the way this
works is, for 200 CP, you can get the whole techbase of one of the 'less' advanced species. Sontarans,
Silurians, and their like. This would be a complete database, with complete and full information on every
piece of technology they have. Cloning, spaceships, hibernation, the works.
The 400 CP version lets you get tech from the more advanced species, instead, like 'future humanity'
with Time Travel and Galaxy Cracker bombs, or data on similar levels from other species like the Time
Lords or so.
For 800 CP, though... all bets are off. This is the complete, no-holds barred archive of every single scrap of
knowledge ever assembled in the history of this universe. From the blood and magic manipulations of
the Carrionites, to the works crafted by the Ancients to bind the Beast, to every piece of Time Lord and
Dalek technology, the in-depth studies of Time Lord biologies... the mother lode. It's all here,everything,
ready for you to learn, teach others, and use however you will.
Jumpers of any particular species can take their species's archives at a discount... except Daleks and Time
Lords, who can at best get the 400 level info at a discount. The 800 CP archive is not discounted to
anyone. In future jumps, wherever applicable every version updates to hold the same level of knowledge
from the local universe."
64,,800CP,Damaged Microchip,Terminator,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"While this looks like the damaged CPU from the first Terminator that Cyberdyne used to help build
Skynet, it is actually a storage device. This contains information on just about everything that Skynet has
ever produced. From the modified T-1 and small Hunter Killers, to the T3000 and Large Hunter Killer
Tanks and Walkers. Even information on how to build an AI as advanced as Skynet is in here, along with
Time Travel technology. The problem is, not only is the coding not understandable by the average
computer, but the damage to it has eliminated some coding. Nothing vital to the schematics, but it is
now even harder to piece the information together. It is unlikely to get all of the information out without
100 years of work."
65,,800CP,Omnitrix,Ben 10 0.1,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"This will one day be called the mightiest weapon in the universe. It is the magnum opus of the genius
Galvan Azmuth and, should things proceed as normal, will spark the legend of Ben Tennyson as a
superhero with the power of many aliens. With this purchase, you now have your very own. The
Omnitrix is a database of alien DNA that allows the user to temporarily transform into a copy of that very
same species, with all the strengths and weaknesses therein, before changing back to normal. This
device is both insanely versatile and capable, so let's see what we can do to personalize your own
version of it. For this section, you receive +1000 Omnitrix Points, or OP. You may gain additional OP by
converting choice points on a 1:1 ratio, getting 50 OP for 50 CP and so forth. You may not convert OP
back to Choice Points, in case it needs to be said."
66,,800CP,Orb Design Plans,Swat Kats,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Well... this is curious. The design plans for a Micro-Brain Repair Unit... this won't show up for some time,
but it is quite useful nonetheless. Once assembled, it will have the ability to scan and repair any
damaged machinery it comes across, simply by using the materials around it. The more advanced the
machine is, the longer it will take... but it will do its job. Even more concerningly, it has the ability to
learn and adapt itself, assimilating machinery to create a more grand body. It may come with existential
issues... are you sure you want this?"
67,,800CP,The Holy Grail,Girl Genius SB,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Well not quite, but it might as well be. This is something literally any spark in this world would kill for,
something that, if it were out in the open, would cause a furore that would make the Long War look like
a childish squabble. Attached to your warehouse is an archive holding a complete, unabridged, detailed
history of this world, all the way from the dawn of the very first civilization to the second before you
enter the world. Every war stratagem, every population census, the name of every ruler, it's all recorded
here in extensive detail. But that's not what would attract people to it like moths to a flame. That would
be the Scientific archive. Because you see, this archive also holds literally every scrap of knowledge this
world has ever discovered or used. Every novel or book ever written, every scientific principle
discovered, every paper, journal article or private message, the blueprints for each and every device
made throughout the history of the planet, the details of the Second Breakthrough... everything. Don't
go showing it off, yeah? In future worlds too, this updates to hold the same level of information on local
things.

68,,800CP,The Ruins,DOOM 3,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"One of the most important fields of research in the UAC Mars base involves physics, dimensional
technologies, organic technology, and many more things but it starts with history. Beneath the base lies
a vast network of ruins, burial chambers and other structures belonging to the long-dead inhabitants of
Mars - a people that some theorize are in fact the ancient progenitors of humanity itself. Though heavily
damaged and weathered by the passage of time, many of the devices within still function, and the
inscriptions recovered from the Martian dig sites have contained information beyond anything humanity
understood - leading to some of the most advanced scientific theories of the modern day. You are now in
charge of a sizable dig site working through these ruins, with direct authority over the discoveries made
within. In future worlds, you will likewise come into possession of a similarly vast Archaeological site,
belonging to a suitably powerful precursor from the setting you are in. Predicting what kind of advances
might be realized through investigating these ruins will be difficult but no matter what, results will always
be spectacular in some way."
69,,800CP,Unabridged Memory Banks,Green Lantern,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Ooh. The Guardians would go apeshit if they knew you had this. This is a full-fledged, unabridged copy of
the Oan archives, the sum total of the Guardians and the Green Lantern corps' history and knowledge
base. Somewhere deep in these records there is even the lore of harnessing emotional lights and making
lantern rings, but it took the hyper-intelligent guardians literal ages in time and untold amounts of
resources to do it, so...y'know. If you have a power ring this data is placed in its memory banks, but you
can get it in any other medium that you desire as well."
70,,900CP,Armorer | Fixer | Weaponsmith,Light of Terra DLC 5 - A Sky Filled With Steel,Domain: Databases: Mundane,"Armourer (300CP) A mental database containing information on the most common types of armour
found in the Necromunda Hive and how to build, repair and maintain them. While this doesn't sound
impressive, it is worth pointing out there are countless billions of people dwelling within the hive, and
they have been here for millenia - the list of things counted as common at one time or another ranges
from Power Armour in the distant past to the more common hammered metal plates made by local
Gangers to the standard Imperial Guard Carapace Armour. Don't expect to start churning out Adetus
Astartes Power Armour the second you get this though - the infrastructure to build the infrastructure to
build the infrastructure to build the armour was lost to ruin a long time ago. There's a reason the Space
Marinesuse suits thousands of years old.
Fixer (300CP) This Schema contains a massive database filled with the countless bits of equipment the
denizens of Necromunda Hive Primus have bought, found, built, stolen or obtained by other means over
the centuries since the Hive was founded. Inexplicably it also seems to contain an extremely rare,
extremely valuable and extremely heretical to own database detailing how to build and maintain
Admech servitors and cybernetic parts.
Weaponsmith (300CP) To weaponry what Armourer is to protective gear, this is a massive database of
the various tools of mayhem the denizens of the Necromunda hive have wielded against each other.
While the high tech equipment possible may seem nice, do not underestimate the value of low tech
weaponry. Crafting a plasma pistol and crafting a bayonet require wildly different sets of skills, and all too
often people who have one assume they have the other, to their chagrin"
