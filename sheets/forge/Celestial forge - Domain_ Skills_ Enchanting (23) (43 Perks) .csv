1,,100CP,Geomancy ,World of Darkness - Mortal,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"The art of geomancy (known as feng shui in the East) is the study of harmonizing the physical environment with the flow of energy. The goal of feng-shui is to create the ideal place to live or work. Through a combination of architectural design and mystic mathematics, a geomancer plans a pattern that must be duplicated within the entire structure (in the case of a building) or the layout of a room or series of connected rooms (in the case of interior design). Implementing this design increases the time required and the cost of the work involved, but practitioners consider it well worth the effort. When designing a geomancy effect, the thaumaturge chooses a single Attribute or Skill to be the focus.
Once assigned, the Trait cannot be changed without completely redesigning the location. Attribute-based designs are more difficult to create than Skill-based ones. The selected Trait must reflect the building or space's function. For example, a library might enhance academic or research skills. If the thaumaturge is successful, she creates a unique design that benefits those who use the location in the manner for which it was created, provided that the design is followed perfectly. If the thaumaturge creates her geomancy design successfully, and the architect or interior designer successfully integrates the design into the physical location, the flow of energy is modified within the space. Any action that takes place in the space using the designated Attribute or Skill may gain a bonus.
Once a geomantic design is created and implemented, it remains in effect indefinitely unless something happens to disrupt or change the flow of energy. Natural disasters may change the magical landscape more than they appear to affect it physically, requiring geomantic designs to be realigned. New construction or destruction of buildings or even spaces within a building may require that a thaumaturge reassess the location for potential updates. Poorly designed geomantic locations may disrupt those around them, as well. The only limits on the number of designs a geomancer may create are her time, her capability and the ability of others to come up with the resources to put her designs into place."
2,,100CP,Inner Linings ,Final Fantasy XIV,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"A customer came to you one day with a strange request for you to make a leather jacket which would be thinner, enough so that it would take multiple jackets to equal the bulk and weight of a normal jacket. As strange as that request was, when you watched him enchant the various jackets it suddenly made sense. Instead of trying to enchant a single jacket multiple times, he would wear multiple jackets enchanted once. But you can improve on that idea. Instead of attempting to craft multiple thinner jackets, you've opened up inner linings in existing pieces of work. As you predicted, while the ease of stacking enchantments has gone up, the overall durability of the item has dropped by a bit. Perhaps with time and better materials, you could rectify the second point. Having so many inner linings also helps quite a bit when it comes to deeper pockets, which is a nice side effect."
3,,100CP,Prodigy Enchanter ,God Catching Alchemy Meister,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Alchemists are the most known for giving magical properties to weapons and potions, and yet, any skilled enough mage can do the same thing, perhaps even better when it's an element they control well enough. That's the case with you, prepared in case you needed to enchant something and didn't have the time or resources to get a good alchemist. While the design and other details may not be as good as the work of a professional, you are capable of imbuing the power of magic in any item you wish to use. Effectiveness depending on your mana and affinity."
4,,100CP,You Runed Everything ,Elder Scrolls Online,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Before the development of the Arcane Enchanter in the 4th Era which streamlined enchanting to the point that any novice without even the barest hint of magicka could bind an enchantment, and even before the Guild-standardized enchanting techniques of the 3rd Era which drastically eased the process to a simple matter of shoving stored magicka into an item, the tool of choice for infusing an item with a magical effect was the humble Glyph. A Glyph is a combination of three runes, one inscribed with the potency which determines the base strength and whether it adds or removes, one with the desired attribute to effect such as health or a specific element , and a third designating its aspect, ranging from Common to Legendary. You know enough to be able to use and translate up to Rank Five runes (Pora, Denara, Hade and Idode), with even more becoming available to you as you research and translate more."
5,,200CP,Augment Blade System ,Dark Cloud 2,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"A warrior needs a trusty weapon, and with blacksmiths in short supply, it seems that most people have taken to modifying and improving their own equipment. The main technique the survivors in this world seem to use allows weapons to grow as individuals might learning from experience gained in live combat. For as long as you continue to wield a weapon and use it, it will grow in terms of all its basic qualities, including traits like durability, strength, and ease of use. Should you switch weapons or pass your weapon on to another, the growth will stop until you pick that weapon back up again to focus on it. However, it will retain any experience it has already accumulated, so there's no worry of your work being lost over time."
6,,200CP,Gemcrafted ,Touhou Luna Nights,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"You have the ability to turn use the power of gemstones to create an alternate dimension full of replicas of terrain and people. Additionally, you know how to create loyal, obedient monsters and replicas of other people who can fight for you, or perhaps just guard your alternate locations, and you may communicate with them clearly regardless of distance. A weak monster might require a couple of amethysts, while one that can fly around, fire lasers and take a terrible amount of damage might require at least a high-quality diamond. Creating alternate dimensions will require on the order of thousands of gemstones even for a relatively small patch of land. Also note that none of them are truly intelligent and just follow pre-programmed orders."
7,,200CP,Heretical Adaptation ,Senki Zesshou Symphogear,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Symphogears are, in essence, a Relic adapted into a combat system for it's ability to generate massive amounts of energy that can be formatted into a certain kind of matter through a generic mass-energy converter. However, they also have the ability to 'evolve' overtime, gaining additional armor and improvements to features such as onboard thrusters. With a bit of study, it might be possible to apply this adaptive behavior to other materials, encouraging them to improve themselves over time."
8,,200CP,Loremaster ,Divinity - Original Sin,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Dusty tomes and yellowing scrolls are remnants of history, fragments of knowledge from ages past sent forward through ink and paper. While much of the world fails to give these storehouses of information their proper credit, those who dive into them discover lost secrets to hold true power. Or at the very least, a few answers. Loremasters nearly always have some form of magical talent, as it is the study of the arcane in essence. However, there are those for whom it is the extent of their abilities to draw out a few secrets from the books and little else.
Apprentices of the old lore are taught, not by rote, but by arguments. They are told to seek out the flaws in others' logic, to pick apart the minutia of another's words, and to seek the shades of truth in every conversation. While at first no student sees the value in this, they soon learn that they can apply such introspection to the magical items they find. With a few moments study and a jeweler's loupe they can discern the enchantment bound to a particular item.
Unlike the other skills, this one requires further training to see its true worth. In the beginning, a novice Loremaster will only be able to discover the basics of an enchantment. The essential element or driving force. But as one grows more experienced they will be able to pick up the minutia, dipping into the ins and outs of even the most subtle enhancements."
9,,200CP,Magic Style: Enchantment | Magic | Magic Power: Rank 1 | Magic Skill: Rank 1 ,Fairy Tail,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"It's time to choose the Magical Styles that you have already learned upon entering this world. Whilst most magical styles can be learned with time and effort and the right teacher or source of knowledge, buying them here will allow them to benefit from the skill that Magic Skill ranks grant as well as allow access to extremely rare or lost magics or magics that require certain traits to use. A list of the magics that can be bought as well as their costs can be found at the end of the jump document. It should be noted that some Magic Styles will not be purchasable through this option. Most of these are Holder Type magics, which all deal with magical items that are offered for purchase in the item section, and some are simply Caster Type magics that are too unique and either offered as part of a separate perk or not at all. This may change in the future as the series progresses or not.
Magic (Fairy Tail) (FREE) Ethernano is the source of energy that runs through our world of Earthland and from the bodies of those native to this place. It’s what allows us all to accomplish the act known as Magic, casting spells and the like. Not everyone has the ability to use magic but you’re one of those lucky ones, like about a tenth of Earthland’s population. How powerful and talented you are, along with what magic you know already, will be decided below.
Before we go on, the most important thing to know about magic in this world is that it is more than just a source of energy like what you get from food and more than just a power that you study and practice with to use in battle like a gun or martial arts. It is part of you, ebbing and flowing as you do. When your heart soars and your soul burns hot, your magic will answer with a leap and a bound in might. Intense emotions can colour and enhance magical power, sometimes to massive extents, and no emotion is greater at this than love. Both friendship and romance, the magic of this world responds in purest form to these emotions and what makes you feel them. Some say that this might even be the true source of all magic in the world, the love that let us come so far.
Magic Power: Rank 1 (Fairy Tail) (FREE) You have the innate potential to be a Mage and to use Magic, that’s for certain. But not all Wizards are equal to each other. The amount of Magical Power you have and can use is different for every person. It can be trained and improved over time but that’ll take effort and time. The ranks below are made on the assumption that you are human, being a race with more innate magic will increase the benefits of various ranks as well. It is important to note that, in general, magical power generally translates into physical power, though it is unclear whether this is a natural boost or the effect of basic and easy to learn enhancement magic that most mages make use of. You begin with Rank 1 for free.
Rank 1 The average for any combat capable Wizard. You’re certainly able to fight and no normal humans are likely to stand up to you at first but you’ll be tired after a few minutes and don’t expect to be blowing up houses. Levy McGarden and Lucy Heartfilia at the start of the Fairy Tail series are examples of this level.
Magic Skill: Rank 1 (Fairy Tail) (FREE) Magical Power is not the only thing that governs your overall might. Any fool can fling about his energy like a brute but only with skill and knowledge will a sorceress be able to use her magic to its utmost limit. This option describes the talent for magic in general you have as well as the specific training in any Styles you have bought from the start. Magic Skill applies to all Magic Styles you have bought with the option following this one, not to ones you learn in the future, though higher ranks of this option will grant greater skill with magic as a whole as well. You can choose how exactly your Skill manifests for your Styles, such as if you want to focus in a certain area. You might want to be an Ice Mage that focuses on Make Magic to create tools or creatures from Ice, rather than manipulate Ice directly.
Rank 1 You know your magics and how to use them but many of the advanced moves and tricks are still hidden from you. You’re an effective combatant using your magic and so long as they’re not stronger than you in Magical Power, you’ll have a good chance of winning against your peers. Grey Fullbuster at the start of the series is an example of this."
10,,200CP,Magic: Enchanting ,Samurai Jack,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"You can grant magical properties to weapons by marking them with ancient runes. Right now you only know how to give weapons elemental properties, but you can learn more enchantments by studying other enchanted and magical weapons."
11,,200CP,Magical Specializations ,Kane Chronicles,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"The true worth of every magician is their path specialization. You have come to possess knowledge, you have a few years of training in a path specialization of your choice, enough to make you an expert though you are still many years from being a master. A list of canon specializations will be at the notes section at the bottom of the jump. This perk can be taken multiple times.
Charm Magic: The magic concerned with the enchantment of permanent magical devices and objects, such as a magician's tools and the ritual implements required for complex and powerful spells( many such implements are single use and highly specific) as well as pre-prepared spellcasting."
12,,200CP,Minor Enchantment ,Gunnerkrigg Court,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,Make boots that will always fit or makeups that change to your whims. These magical tricks have a very wide range of applications but will generally not be on a very grand scale; though the utility from walking on walls is not to be denied.
13,,200CP,Specialist's Hammer ,Dark Souls 2,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Bridging the mystical and with the mundane, mystical with the tools of man, are there many acts more satisfying than that? With a solid hammer and good ember, you are capable of just such feats. You may harness the qualities of magical, supernatural or just outright strange materials to improve existing constructs not composed of such things. An iron sword could be imbued with the arcane nature of the soul to better bypass armor, or a shield with the power to halt darkness infused attacks. You are also bestowed skill with smithing, though mostly towards the area that the above powers require. That is to say, hammering and burning the powers of material described above into things."
14,,200CP,Weapon Absorption ,Dark Cloud,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Were the Moon People the ones who developed weapons as they exist in the world today? Perhaps, with their technological expertise, they tampered with such things - but we may well never know. Your weapons modified with this will adapt the concept of ""experience"", allowing them to grow as more enemies are defeated with them. As more enemies are defeated, you can absorb other weapons into the base template - improving the qualities of the original weapon."
15,,300CP,Blessed By A God: Enchanting ,Everyone Else is a Returnee,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Gain a blessing from one of the recorded gods, gaining a boost in whatever skill or stat they stand for. Additionally, you exemplify that skill or trait, standing heads and shoulders above all others in that field. These gods and goddesses cover just about every domain and aspect there is, from fire to beauty to magic."
16,,300CP,Paint to Life ,Ib,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"It's said that spirits dwell in objects into which people put their feelings, and the same applies for artwork.  You now have the ability to give life to paintings, statues, and other artworks.  Even a crayon sketch of a sun would give off heat and light as if it were real.  There are but a couple of catches.  First, you can only animate works that you made by your own hands.  Second, they cannot be of people who exist in the real world; in the case of inanimate things such as moons and stars, or things that have multiple copies such as a species of snake, they can still be created.  Third, to give life to an artwork you must sacrifice a small but vital piece of your own life.  It is possible to recover in time, but overdoing things may put you at the edge of death.  Although you can create works that have magical powers, to fully use their magic in the real world they would require continual magic support from you.  Also, the act of creation does not give you control over the animated works, and they retain independent wills, though they will generally respect their maker."
17,,300CP,Profession: Enchanting ,World of Warcraft,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Imbue all manner of equitable items with magical properties and enhancements using dusts, essences and shards gained by disenchanting (breaking down) magical items that are no longer useful. Enchanters can also make a few low-level wands, as well as oils that can be applied to weapons providing a temporary magical buff. You also have the ability to create Inscriptions which act as enchantments for your skills & abilities. Zen Master: At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on even playing field with top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field."
18,,300CP,The Great Enchanter ,Bartimaeus Sequence,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Staff of Gladstone, Amulet of Samarkand, Ring of Solomonthis world sure has a lot of artifacts, heh? Well, now you can make even more! You become unbelievably talented at binding Djinn into items to give them mystical powers. Summon a djinni and stitch it into a rug to make a flying carpet? Easypeasy. Detonation Sticks, Convulsion spheres and flux bombs, all a day's work. You still need the parts, but they seem almost eager to flow into the right shape under your expert hands."
19,,400CP,A Price for Everything ,Rick And Morty,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Curses! You can curse objects. The curse affects anyone in possession of the object and can only be dispelled by unnaturally advanced science or magic. The more ironic the object/curse combination the more powerful it is. Pairs of running shoes that cause people to run till they die, fox boas that skin the user, etc."
20,,400CP,Artisan ,Silmarillion,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"You are considered a skilled craftsman even among the Dwarves. Weapons and armor that can stand the test of time and come out looking newly crafted centuries later. Mithril and other mystical metals are no harder than working with Iron and Steel for you. With much time and energy you may also enchant the items as you craft them, like the Dragon-helm which struck an unnatural fear into the enemies of its wearer. While you are skilled in the crafting of many things it is your mastery of the construction of weapons and armor that is truly awe inspiring. Perhaps with practice and time you might even be considered the equal of Telchar."
21,,400CP,Celestial Mirror ,Final Fantasy X,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Long ago, it was believed that seven luminaries possessed weapons which were peerless in their respective categories. Though the legends themselves have been lost to time, the weapons still exist – as does a method to obtain them. But power never comes without a sacrifice or two…
You possess the ability to enhance your weapon to a remarkable degree, by allowing them to absorb experience and grow naturally. However, to facilitate this growth, not only will the strength of your weapon decrease while it is growing, the power of its effects will also decrease. Naturally as you may have suspected, the only way for a weapon to gain experience is to emerge victorious from a fight...you have a long road ahead of you Guardian. It’s probably best to start with some easy fiends.
You can return your weapon to full strength at any time, but its growth will stop while in this state."
22,,400CP,Craftsman ,Hercules,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Greek myth sure does love it's weapons and armors, doesn't it? You're great at making both, now. Not only do you have a preternatural skill at putting together weapons, armor and other artefacts of the very highest quality, being able to work legendary items from common tools and materials, but you're also a whiz at enchanting them. Simply put, you can imbue just about any and all magic and power you have into items, and have it work as you desire. It also helps you figure out existing examples of craft, and replicating the effects on your own."
23,,400CP,Enchanter ,Morroblivion,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,You are capable of enchanting objects well. You know how to trap souls and how best to get good effects.
24,,400CP,Enchanting ,Scooby Gamers,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"You're an expert at enchanting things, knowing a bunch of basic enchantments and having the skills to figure out most enchantments on various items from just examining them."
25,,400CP,Enchantment ,Silmarillion,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"The Elves are capable of great works of Enchantment, able to infuse their spirits into things they create and tie into the natural forces of Arda. Rings of power, magical orbs that can see far distance, runes of power crafted alongside the Dwarves. You are an expert on the path of enchantment. Non-weapon enchanted items are your expertise and with enough time and training you could potentially create a ring of power to rival even that of Sauron or craft something in the like of the mighty Silmarils."
26,,400CP,Enchantment? ,Dragon Age,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"That's odd, you seem to understand the process of inscribing lyrium runes on items, to add or enhance properties. Without lyrium, enchantments are temporary."
27,,400CP,Iterative Improvement ,Worm,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Each day you gain a certain amount of charge, which you can spend to effectively enchant objects with superpowers. The more charge you invest in a particular object, the more you can improve and expand its abilities. A single day's charge would give an object a minor power, but over time you can increase it with no upper limit beyond your investment. These objects only work for you unless you make it otherwise. As you use your power, experiment with it, and it matures from conflict and experience, the amount of charge you gain per day will increase. You can hold about a month's worth of charge at any one time, any more will be wasted.
* Do note that at the end of the jump the power turns innate and is not supplied by a shard anymore"
28,,400CP,Runeforging ,World of Warcraft,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,Runeforging is the art of imbuing your weapons with runes that grant said weapon additional abilities or strengthening your own abilities. Though the game only lists 4 abilities with this you can fanwank responsibly to add additional runeforge abilities of your own. Purchasing this perk also allows you to imbue a weapon with both an Enchant as well as a Runeforging.
29,,500CP,Elven Enchantment ,Lord of the Rings,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"You can enchant objects, if you pour energy into them as they are created. Some of your enchantments are useful in battle, such as swords that never dull and bows that always strike true, but most are simply to ease the life of the wearer, such as cloaks that weigh nothing and aid in hiding and water-flasks that never leak. You may also perform great workings, such as the creation of hidden doorways, given time."
30,,500CP,Enchantment ,World of Darkness - Sorcerer,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"The sorcery of creating items with magical abilities and properties. Five ranks, top rank cost 500CP. Examples of each rank below.
[1] The Enchanter creates a minor item with limited use only and a tight area of influence. Such as a jacket that works as abnormally good camouflage in a crowd, or glasses that never fog.
[2] The Enchanter creates a more powerful talisman that is noticeable as magic. A flask that blocks three bullets and no more, objects that increase a mundane skill by a noticeable amount when used.
[3] The Enchanter creates a talisman whose function is obviously magical. Shoes that double running speed, a charm that can protect its wearer from magic three times a day.
[4] The Enchanter creates a talisman that is able to defy several of the limitations of the Consensus. Clothing that grant superhumanly impressive but otherwise mundane abilities, a throwing knife that never shall never miss.
[5] The Enchanter creates talisman with almost miraculous powers. A golem, or a ring that hides its user from magical detection."
31,,600CP,Call Me Parry ,Eureka-Warehouse 13-Alphas,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"You have a unique insight into how to combine Artefacts in order to enhance and alter the nature of their effects, often by an entire order of magnitude, and even create new Artefacts through careful research and experimentation."
32,,600CP,Crystal Crafter ,Anima Beyond Fantasy,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"The world is not one made for your kind. Artifacts are forged for wizards and warriors, and few for you. That will not stop you, however. By taking a gemstone, you can imbue it with potential, cutting and polishing and changing it until it amplifies the psychic abilities of the one who bears it, making the powers of the mind easier to call upon and stronger when used."
33,,600CP,Fuinjutsu Prodigy ,Naruto,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"You are one of the very few who are talented in the art of Fuinjutsu, an esoteric discipline combining all the complexities of calligraphy and physics. Despite the difficulty in learning fuinjutsu, skilled practitioners find it well worth it. Fuinjutsu, or sealing, is at its most basic storing something within something else through symbols to be released at another time. More advanced techniques still follow this same principle, but to great effect. Seal masters can seal away the elements, chakra, form summoning contracts, teleport, or even summon and bind souls using these principles. It's only downside is that this art is massively difficult to learn even for the talented, and will take years of intense study to master. You start off knowing how to make the two most basic of seals: The storage seal which allows you to store items in slips of paper much smaller than they are, and the explosive seal which is basically a few glyphs on a piece of paper the size of a greeting card that explodes like a small amount of plastique."
34,,600CP,Hell Jumper Creator ,Dragon Ball,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Why let just one thing take pride of place as your favourite creation? If you make two, you can make them into an even better single creation! It just needs a bit of work here and there. With your personal creations, you're able to combine any two similar creations into a greater whole. While this combination can only be done once, it will be more and more effective the more similar the two parts that are being combined are. Two swords that you've made, without being the same type of sword or same material of make, would only be half again as good once combined. Two swords that are exactly the same, down to the method of creation and time spent on the smithing? You'd have a sword hundreds of times more powerful than either of the originals. So long as you personally made it or had a large hand in its creation, you'll be able to apply this fusion and even reverse the fusion to separate the two halves once more."
35,,600CP,Infusionist ,Monster Hunter,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"The ability to infuse items with abilities, Usually Elemental abilities. How good the infused ability depends on the quality and use of the item."
36,,600CP,Lord Jumper's Armor ,Skulduggery Pleasant v1.05,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"You can infuse copies of your abilities into objects, turning them into focuses for those powers. Using these focuses in concert with the original power within your body will see your might with these abilities enhanced dramatically. Alternatively, you could loan these items to allies and subordinates to grant them access to these powers. Objects that you infuse with your power are also infused with your will. This allows them to act independently to enact your will, and enables them to refuse others the right to use the power they grant. You may only create one focus per power, and a given item can only contain one power at a time. When these items are destroyed, the power flows back into you, and you can create a new focus for it.
Boosted: Your power has risen to new heights in a number of different ways. Firstly, you are capable of creating multiple focuses for the same ability with no loss in their overall power level, and using the same item as a focus for more than a single ability. The true strength of this ability, however, is that each and every one of your powers has become semi-sentient being of its own, a kind of pseudo-consciousness based on your will attached to the ability. These consciousnesses are aligned with you in terms of morality and intent, and can add their force of will to yours. When you work in concert with them, your precision, control, and raw power output increase without any additional exertion on your part. Furthermore, in the event that you are incapacitated in some fashion, these consciousnesses can take control of your body, wielding the power they are attached to in order to protect your body until you return. Alternatively, you could grant your powers control of your body while you fully devote your mind to other tasks. Because of this boost, you may choose to make your focuses tangible avatars of your individual powers, turning them from semi-sentient objects to fully sapient ones. These conscious powers will not manifest as whispering voices in the back of your head unless you want them to."
37,,600CP,Master enchanter,Unmodded Minecraft,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Removing the randomness and ambiguity of the usual process is the least of what you can do. You don't suffer any restrictions when it comes to what kind of item can get what kind of enchantment, so you can fish up treasures with a chain-sickle or empower a shovel to deal massive damage to the undead. Selectively remove or add new effects to an existing magical item, or transfer effects from one item to another. Fuse multiple similar magical items together to make a single, stronger item. While there are limits to how much magic that can be crammed into something, the limit is much higher for you. This skill also covers the creation of space-bending chests that can store far more than their external dimensions should allow for."
38,,600CP,New Age Necromancer ,Dungeon Keeper Ami,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Once upon a time wizards were happy enough being able to raise undead, throw fireballs, and curse their enemies, well those were the old days and this is now. You are a modern wizard, you know the value of a well enchanted suit of armor. You know how to mix enchantments in such a way that things such as moving remote piloted armor suits are a very real possibility that you can make reality, magic powered railroads and three dimensional rune set ups are simply child's play for you, and even something as complicated as creating a gold powered dungeon heart is eventually possible. Though most enchantments are powered by mana you can offset this somewhat in two ways, either by instead binding the souls of the dead to your creations lowering the mana cost considerably the more souls you bind to it or by burning gold to take the place of mana that would be spent if you are squeamish."
39,,600CP,NineRealms Craftsman ,The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"You have the skill to create wonders; not only those of technology, but of magic as well. You're a skilled enchanter, capable of creating armor and weaponry that withstands the ages and never dulls or breaks; your skill is such that you can permanently enchant Uru safely, which would allow you to create weapons like Mjolnir or Stormbreaker. You're even capable of enchanting machinery; granting them similar magical effects, and more. Even without magic, your crafts are of quality worthy of the gods, and the quality of all of your future creations will be increased greatly. Post-Spark, your ability to create wonders will increase; weaponry that would allow one to go toe to toe with cosmic beings and bridges that span the worlds you've visited; with time, there's very little you couldn't create."
40,,600CP,The Fire in the Forging ,Circle of Magic,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"You have acquired a mastery of enchantment, the imprinting of permanent or semipermanent magical effects into your chosen medium. Weapons imbued with fire, cloth as protective as armor, far more powerful potions, cupcakes that satisfy all food cravings for days, trees that eat sound, stone paths that rearrange themselves every day... if you can figure out an effect, there's a good chance you can, eventually, figure out how to impart it... assuming you have the right magics and enough power at your disposal."
41,,600CP,Voodoo Crap Magic ,Rick And Morty,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Are you the devil? Well even if you're not you have the ability to enchant objects. These enchantments are undeniably potent, the more fitting the object/enchantment combination the more powerful it is. Aftershave that causes intense attraction in females, a microscope that shows fundamental truths and so on."
42,,700CP,The Rune Is Mightier Than The Sword | Runic Spell Innovator | Enchanting,World Seed,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"The Rune Is Mightier Than The Sword (100CP) The one thing throwing people off the runic language is its sheer volume. Considering that there are ninety-nine million, two hundred and thirty thousand, seven hundred and sixty nine of them, representing every single word and concept in all known languages, even things such as watering the grass every week, that's no surprise. Because of that, even learning the runic language can be a challenge, requiring either a brain implant or some other form of perfect memory. Anyone who doesn't have access to these things needs to spend time and effort to search for those runes they'll actually use and transcribe them into a book or save them to their computer. Luckily, you won't have to deal with such shortcuts: as of now, you are fluent in the entirety of the runic language, and will never forget it. Furthermore, as you will undoubtedly encounter words and concepts foreign to the people in this universe throughout your travels, it will update itself to include runes for anything you might encounter in the future.
Runic Spell Innovator (200CP) Considering that one simply needs to combine the runes for Blast and Fire to make a fireball, or use the do the same with the Reinforce and Mind runes to create a basic spell to protect against mind altering effects, one might think that runic magic is incredibly easy. Well, one would be wrong. Runes can be considered a programming language of sorts, affecting reality. They are used to program magical devices, and also for Runic Magic, an alternative to Arcane Magic that uses less mana and requires less control over your mana, but only does exactly what you program it to do. Now, as with regular programming, any schmuck can do the equivalent of writing hello world and throw a fireball or two, but anything more complex than that requires intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, and patience. Things that you now possess in spades. And with that and the knowledge of the runic language, infinite possibilities lie open to you: whether it's bashing someone's head in with the Force rune, setting up intricate spell diagrams and runic circles to automate even the most complex of processes, or creating spells of all magical disciplines for anything you can think of and more, someone who truly knows how to use Runic Magic is a sight to behold. And your true talent, the invention and creation of new runic spells and programs, applies to all of these avenues. If you keep at it, no magic will be beyond your reach.
Enchanting (400CP) Enchanting is a skill probably best described as the enhancement of an object's Aura. At first, one would need to find out which enhancement fits an object best, though skilled enchanters obviously do not need to care about that, and then lay down a basic enchantment that increases a stat, like wisdom and strength, or attack and defence. Like normal magic, there are two forms of enchanting, arcane and runic, though enchanting is by no means a magic, but rather a skill like sewing or tailoring. The former requires you to know the right school of magic related to your enchantments, like a magic that increases toughness for a durability enchantment, but is more powerful because of that, while the latter simply requires you to know the right runes and how to use them.
Although normally people would specialize in one of these forms of enchanting, you're skilled in both of them, enough that you'll soon be able to easily start using more advanced form of enchanting, such as giving objects elemental enchantments or even very specific abilities, though for the latter you need to be at least somewhat familiar with them yourself.
With some experimentation, you'll also be able to learn techniques that will increase the power of your enchantments by dozens of times, like material enchanting, where you enchant an object at every stage of its creation, such as enchanting the steel a sword will be forged from, the fire that will be used to melt it, and the water used to cool it, after which you enchant the finished sword one last time after its completion.
Another trick to enchanting is that natural objects like wood or animal parts can fit up to two or three times more enchantments like man made ones in them. After a creature dies, and its soul dissipates, the aura is left withered, a shadow of its former self. But because of that hollowness, that emptiness, those items have far more room for improvement of their aura, allowing for the creation of a staff that can match up to any plasma weapon, or a bow that will never miss its mark.
You excel at finding similar loopholes and techniques to advance your skills whether they are enchanting or not, and even if you were ever stuck, with seemingly no way to advance your skills to the next level, as long as you continue to research and experiment, you'll also be able to either innovate or learn something that will allow them to continue on growing. This works even when it absolutely shouldn't. Rest assured, there will be no barriers to bar you from growing ever more competent. Work at it for a few years, and even something on the level of the Seeds would not be beyond you. And considering your skill at enchanting, that will become useful far sooner than you might've thought, starting at a level others would need years to reach.
You can probe the Aura of anything with a mere glance, knowing at a moment's notice what enchantments would fit best, and the speed at which you work your magic might make other people think you're doing it with just a wave of your hand. And you'll continue to be able to work at that speed no matter how complex the work you're attempting. Who knows, you might even become the first combat enchanter with that kind of skill."
43,,800CP,Lordship of All Things | Cultivation | Required Secondary Abilities ,Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms,Domain: Skills: Enchanting,"Lordship of All Things (800CP) Formations can, through being shaped in particular directions, powered by multiple people or formation flags, result in a variety of different effects. Such effects include creating an attacking formation which would allow a small number of weaker cultivators to take out one stronger than them, or a trapping formation that only brute strength completely eclipsing that of the people controlling it could hope to break, and finally, one can even use formations to help gather elemental energy and ki so they can train much faster than what would normally be possible. All of this knowledge and more is now passed on to you, as you find yourself a master of Formations, their creation, and their utilization, as well as heavy insight into the Grand Dao of Formations. With a year of practice and the proper reagents, you could even conceivably create formations of the scope which caused the four thousand kilometer wide elemental stone mine in the Ji Clan's territory through the gathering of elemental energy, and with a decade, setting down formations like ones that would normally be set around the Ji Clan territory, capable of killing Celestial Immortals, could be qualified as a warm up (depending on your own level of power of course) Creating a formation such as the Rahu Formation that allows a multitude of cultivators to band together in order to form an avatar that is vastly stronger than the sum of its parts would take you a decade or so of research (once again, that is if you had the required level of power for it). Keep in mind, however, that creating formations also requires insight into the Daos. Creating a Wind Formation will be absolutely impossible without the necessary insight into the Dao of Wind.
To add to this, you also gain tremendous insight into the Grand Dao of Constructs, allowing you to, with enough practice, create golems equal to the Daofather Golems that the Lord of All Things created, and make them in bulk just as he did. You do need the right materials and many assistants for that, however. Finally, you gain the ability to create and cultivate strange creatures known as Queens who are able to give birth to hundreds of warriors to create an army. Both the appearance of the Queens and warriors are completely up to you, and they'll be at the same level of intelligence as a normal sentient being. At first, you'll simply be able to make one or two of them at the Xiantian Level, with their children only being at the Houtian Realm, and only in their dozens. But as your own personal power increases, you could create or upgrade queens capable of rivaling even Empyrean Gods and cultivators stronger stall, with them being capable of birthing thousands of lesser creatures. The intelligence of their spawn is also variable, with some of the weaker grunts simply being like insects that the Queens can see through and puppet from a distance, and their generals being at the very top of the level they were spawned at and being just as intelligent as the Queens. This scales with your cultivation level as the Golems or Queens are always one level below you. In future Jumps you'll find yourself picking up arts and abilities similar to constructs and formations incredibly quickly.
Cultivation (0CP) In this world, people use the art of cultivation to increase their powers. This practice is mostly divided into two ranks: Ki refiners, who generally rely on magical techniques and treasures to fight, powered by the Elemental Essences they absorb, and Fiendgod Body Refiners, who strive to turn their bodies into those of the ancient Fiendgods and utilize divine abilities with vastly varying effects, such as increasing their size, adding extra arms, or even strengthening their bodies beyond their already impressive levels, making their physical abilities and general battle prowess much higher than those of a Ki refiner in exchange for lacking the ability to use treasures and weapons. Thus you get a technique from each of these two types of cultivation to study. Be warned though, that although Fiendgod Body Refiners are much more powerful, their ways of cultivation may be painful to the extreme, or extremely hard to advance in, resulting in decades of effort for just a bit of progress.
There are many stages to cultivation, starting with the Houtian Stage, which signals the very start of a journey, as well as the increase of a cultivator's lifespan to over a hundred years. Then comes the Xiantian Stage, where the body is completely reforged for perfection, and the cultivator's lifespan increases to over two hundred years. The third stage is called Zifu, in which the practitioner forms their own Violet Palace which contains their liquified Ki energy, and enables them to live over four hundred years. The fourth stage, called Wanxiang, is the stage of manifestation, where the practitioner gains access to Divine Will, and increases their lifespan to eight hundred years. The fifth stage, called Primal, gives the practitioner the ability to live forever* (not actually forever)*, with no limits on their lifespan After that comes the Void or Earth mmortal Stage. When a practitioner reaches the Void Stage and attempts to progress to the next level. they shall be met with a final Tribulation. This is a test sent down by the heavens in the form of heavenly wind, fire, and lightning strikes that they must either bear or face total soul annihilation. Then they must pass a test of their Dao Heart in the form of the Demonheart Tribulation, where they shall be tested to see if they are truly dedicated in the matters of Cultivation, and whether they are willing to abandon everything for its sake, though it can be resisted with a powerful Heartforce. If they succeed in this Tribulation, they shall reach the Celestial Immortal Stage, or, in the case of Body Refiners, the Empyrean God Stage, where they shall break free of the mortal coil and the five elements. After that, there are two more stages for both paths of Cultivation: True Immortal for Ki Refiners, or True God for Body Refiners, and then Daofather for Ki Refiners, and Elder God for Body Refiners. Finally, there is the very pinnacle of power in the Three Realms, the World level. This is the level of cultivation Pangu was at when he created the Pangu Chaosworld, and Nuwa similarly reached. While there are even higher levels of power to be grasped, they need not be mentioned for now, and you won't be able to reach them during this jump.
On a final note, once every three hundred years after a practitioner steps into the Zifu Realm, they will be met with a minor tribulation, which will build up in power until finally, they shall face one major tribulation every nine hundred years. Three centuries a Tribulation, nine a Calamity, this shall continue until they either reach the Celestial Immortal stage, or have their souls shattered. For the purposes of this perk you'll be given a technique in both Body Refining and Ki Refining that will last you until the Wanxiang Stage, at which point you'll have to fend for yourself. For 50 CP you can get one that will allow you to advance to the Celestial Immortal and Empyrean God level, using both types of cultivation. Regardless of whether you buy the technique that allows you to train to the Celestial Immortal/Empyrean God level or not, the technique you get is of the highest quality, and you won't need to worry about your future growth being crippled by using it. Your cultivation technique may be aligned towards whatever Dao you wish it to be.
Required Secondary Abilities (0CP) The laws of this Universe are very different from those you are used to, and things such as moving faster than sound are possible for even the most base rank and file Yet they find themselves lacking things such as sonic booms. In this Universe and the ones you will travel to in the future, such protections will thus continue to exist. In addition to this, spending countless years on a single task, or just on living a normal life, also don't seem to be a problem for you anymore.
* Just as a note any creatures created in the world by someone like those queens are absolutely loyalty"
