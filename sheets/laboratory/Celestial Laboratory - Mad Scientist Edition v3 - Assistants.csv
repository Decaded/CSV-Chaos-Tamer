0 CP,Crazy Lover ,Fallout 3,"A slave from Paradise Falls, Clover is as deadly with a blade as she is crazy. Crazy in a fight, crazy in the sack, crazy every which way but loose! But most of all, she's crazy in love with whoever's holding her leash. As her new owner, she would devote her everything to you, even at the cost of her own life."
0 CP,Friendly Mutant ,Fallout 3,"An intelligent super mutant who retained his intellect, Fawkes was held captive and tormented within Vault 87 for his entire existence. But you have come along and freed him, and for that he's eternally grateful. With his mutant biology and a giant gatling laser, there's little that could stop him."
0 CP,Slave,Star Wars - Darth Bane,"Slavery is alive and well in the Star Wars universe, so you might as well buy into the market. With this purchase you get a beautiful and utterly loyal slave. They may be male or female individual of the Zeltron, Twi’lek or Togruta species. This slave can be exceptionally talented in the arts, in matters of manual labour or in ‘entertaining’ their master. They do not technically count as a companion, but can be imported free of charge into future Jumps. No one will object to your ownership of them or question their exotic appearance irrespective of the local laws or demographics."
0 CP,Supernova,Rick and Morty Jump,"There seems to be some kind of temporal paradox, because this is a younger and hotter version of Supernova. This Supernova has not experienced the life that would lead to the outcome of the Supernova from the show, leaving her still enthusiastic and lively, not bitter and enraged. You helped her getting settled after she realized she could never return to her own time, and ever since she has been incredibly loyal and supportive of you, yet due to her younger age and inexperience, she is unable to go the next step towards the relationship she wants to have between you. Should you take the initiative and take the first step, you will find a woman who would dedicate her life for you. You will never have to fear her cheating on you, whether it be with a sentient ant hill or something else. She has all of Supernovas powers and abilities."
100 CP,A Psyker Sidekick ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines","This mortal psyker has been attached to your unit to assist you in sorcerous matters. They lack the physique of a Space Marine, but their training in the psyker ways has been extreme, and their talent for learning is prodigious. They are a Beta-level psyker, either a Primaris psyker if you’re loyal to the Imperium (no relationship to Primaris Space Marines), or a sorcerous rogue psyker if you are a Traitor. If you’re one of the Thousand Sons, they can even be your own personal Thrall Wizard. You may choose two psychic disciplines for them to have an enormous level of knowledge and talent in, and you can rest assured that they are immune to possession from entities of the Warp.
"
100 CP,Assiduous Asari ,Mass Effect - Jumpchain,"Young, only about fifty years old, this Maiden Asari is bright, bubbly, kind, and, well, naive. In the extreme. You’ll meet her getting into trouble with some Batarians, of the “rape and torture” persuasion, and even if she’s got some fire, she’s naff in a fight. Assuming you don’t step in it’s going to be a definite bad end. However, once you’ve rescued her you’ll find she’s loyal to a fault and, while lacking common sense, an excellent cook, wonderful company, and a balm to any weary soul. She’s also most wonderfully talented at all the skills needed at keeping up a household. Somehow, she also managed to win the genetic lottery - having the potential to end a biotic on the level of Samara. Assuming you train her up."
100 CP,Assistant VI,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"It can be argued that the development of AI is inevitable, as all sufficiently advanced technology will eventually become an AI, and the fate of those that deny it is stagnation. We aren't quite there yet, but this personal assistant model Virtual Intelligence is the closest thing allowed in Citadel Space. It can be stored in your omni-tool and can keep track of large amounts of data. With some tweaking, it might eventually become an actual AI, but that is ultimately up to you"
100 CP,Astropath ,Imperial Guard Regiment Gauntlet,"This comm psyker is trained in usage of his powers to establish telepathic communication with astropaths in other systems, this allows your regiment to more directly ask for reinforcements and further guidance from the sector and other important intel. She is a bit haughty and enjoys the feeling of power being the only person that serves as a lifeline between you and the wider world. She is not the best fighter and often pretends to be clumsy. Or at least says that she is pretending. Her haughty front will slowly fall off as you spend time together and survive through various ordeals. She might even become a bit protective of you and try to get some deals from neighbouring worlds, sometimes without your knowing. This will lead to some minor things like additional equipment arriving, transports arriving earlier, being warned about imminent attacks and so on."
100 CP,Collection of Gifts ,Rogue-Like Evolution Jump,"How romantic. It appears you have acquired a supply of gifts for your possible partners, such as candies, varied flowers, perfumes, cute plush toys, interesting books, dildos, vibrators and other kinds of sex toys for example. All the gifts you receive by taking this item will be mundane and usually have no other uses for you than gifting them to your loved ones, but, as a bonus, the supply will always have gifts your partner(s) will enjoy receiving, including things like bags of fresh human blood if you’re dating a vampire for example. Lastly, this supply of gifts will be replenished weekly."
100 CP,Cousin ,Out of Context: Superman Substitute Supplement ,"You seem not to be the only super person on this planet with this companion who was raised on your destroyed planet, thanks to the stasis in their pod they are still a teenager despite being older than your in canon self, they also don't have to be related to you."
100 CP,Digital Companion,Halo Gauntlet,"A UNSC smart A.I assistant. The A.I can be programed with a custom appearance and task. The A.I is sentient so it will quickly start to learn, develop it's own personality and eventually even see you as its partner instead of a master.

100 CP,Dr. Moira Vahlen,X-COM Enemey Unknown ,"Moral scruples are not generally Dr. Vahlen’s thing. The foremost expert that could be found to study novel life-forms unrelated to anything on Earth, the aliens will soon come to fear her laboratory."
100 CP,Dum-E and U,MCU 1,"Okay these robots may not do much, but they've got spirit! ...whatever passes for spirit in robots. Taking the form of single robot arms on treads, they try to do their best to aid you around your home and fulfill your wishes. Along with excellent pattern recognition they're unusually good at assisting with fabrication and mechanical construction of electrinics.

100 CP,Engine-sister,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Voluminous red robes cannot hide the curves beneath to this woman's eternal embarrassment. Friendly and perky in conversation to both man and machine, she is torn between her desire to be closer to the machine and her attachment to humanity. The possibly of a harmonious union between the two has inspired her to follow you."
100 CP,Fiery Warrior,Warhammer 40k: Imperium of Man,"A fairly typical member of the T’au Fire Caste, it’s a mystery why and how she came to ally herself with you. Specializing in long-range combat with her advanced rifle and battlesuit, she can deal incredible amounts of damage and get away before your enemies know any better."
100 CP,Fire from the Stars,World of Lews Superheroes,"When war came to their homeworld these two alien princesses fled and came to Earth in search of refuge from their enemies. Luckily, they found you shortly after landing and latched on to you to be their guide on this strange new world. Though twins, their personalities are almost polar opposites: the younger is sunny and optimistic, perhaps even naive, while the elder has a more cynical and even ruthless disposition and could easily be lured into villainy. Despite their differences they’re as close as sisters can be, maybe even as close as lovers, though I’ll let you discover that for yourself. Both girls possess the Alien powerset and their powers recharge from both sexual activity and ultraviolet light, so they’re quite fond of skimpy outfits and naked sunbathing between battles. They’re also highly empathic and responsive to emotions, yours especially thanks to the close bond they’ve formed with you. Both girls occupy a single companion slot."
100 CP,Fleet and Flotilla ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Love is a fickle thing, both impossibly wonderful and thoroughly miserable. Hopefully, this will smooth out some of that. When in a romantic relationship, you will find that neither of your feelings for each other will ever fade, in fact they seem to do the opposite. The only way a relationship will fail is if you actively commit multiple acts that the other strongly disagrees with."
100 CP,Galatea,Something Unlimited,"She wasn’t supposed to exist yet and, depending on your actions, she might not even be created at all, but, if you want to, you can pay a special price to get her as your Companion right now. Galatea is Supergirl’s clone that you created using professor Emil Hamilton’s samples of the original Galatea, having all of Kara’s powers as a Kryptonian in addition to having a more mature physique than Supergirl that is noticeable due to her bigger ... muscles. Furthermore, she’s completely loyal and horny towards her daddy, you, as this trait is reinforced by being literally built into her genetic code and mental layout. This version of Galatea also has fake memories of fighting the Justice League and being critically injured after disobeying your orders so she has a strong thirst for revenge against the heroes as well as being unwilling to disobey you again despite being quite the hot head."
100 CP,Harley Quinn ,Something Unlimited,"She was the no.1 sidekick of the Joker, having an unhealthy devotion towards him, despite him usually treating her as if she were worthless, however, after a failure on a thief caused by her, the Joker simply
decided to discard her. You found her right after the Joker slapped her and threw her on the floor, so you decided to give her shelter and even helped her to steal a precious diamond in a failed attempt to recover the Joker’s trust. Currently, Harley has already completely given up on the Joker and has redirected her devotion completely to you, being fully willing to act for you with the best of her abilities. In addition to being an excellent fighter and having a complete set of skills related to entertainment, she’s also an incredibly skilled psychologist and manager."
100 CP,Impressionable Youth,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"A child? Why would this child be sent to you, with no Perks save for basic Eldar physiology? The answer becomes clear on closer inspection – this one is apparently a half- breed. While they lack training in any of the common skills of the Eldar, they did seem to inherit some knowledge of repairing Mon'Keigh technology – perhaps training by their human parent earlier in life?"
100 CP,Jeweled Farseer,Warhammer 40k: Imperium of Man,"It’s not unusual for the Eldar to side with the Imperium if the need arises, but this one seems to have latched herself onto you, claiming to see a great destiny before you. Her mastery of the Warp is undeniable, especially when she sends countless shards of crystals to explode violently in the enemies’ faces."
100 CP,Light Bee ,Red Dwarf,"A small cylinder used for creating a hologram of a recorded personality matrix or AI. System for
recording matrices also included. Its very energy hungry though, so do ensure you have some
batteries."
100 CP,Master of Ordinance ,Imperial Guard Regiment Gauntlet,"Have you ever had a problem with your artillery not hitting their targets properly, when they should? Not having enough munitions to pound the enemy into the dirt ? Then you will need this lady and her almost magical skill in acquiring more ammo. If you weren’t always well informed about the whole process she went to acquire said ammunition, you would think she is a heretical witch. Sadly the ammunition she procures only ties to your artillery detachments and mortars as anything beyond that is not her specialty. She can be a bit ruthless and her general answer to any problem is to pound it into dust with overwhelming artillery barrages."
100 CP,Nevermore,World of Lews Superheroes,"Magical powers can come from a lot of places but being part-demon is one of the more common sources given the proliferation of succubi and incubi in the mortal realm. This dark heroine gained her phenomenal magical powers by being the daughter of a powerful demon lord, and to say she has serious daddy issues is something of an understatement. Despite being half-succubus she’s obsessed with self-control and has become highly repressed by trying to reject her demonic heritage, but this is far easier said than done and her spells occasionally backfire on her in lewd ways, like tying herself up in heavy bondage. However with the right mentor to help her get over her hangups she could become a powerful force for good (or evil)."
100 CP,Primaris Psyker,Imperial Guard Regiment Gauntlet,"You have garnered a service of Primaris Psyker. These psykers are feared by many due to their overall disposition and uncomfortable atmosphere surrounding them. She is not happy about the whole “fear” part and this has led her to be very closed and focused on job and her own mental psyche (kinda important, when any mistake can lead to daemon incursion). She is scared of being seen as a monster and having to be exposed to the stares of people so you won’t see her much. If you try to help her and make her feel accepted, she will turn a bit possessive. On one hand, her mental fortitude will go through the roof due to her being sure of herself and having support in you, but having a yandere psyker following you around can sometimes be a problem."
100 CP,Princess Leia Organa ,Star Wars - Jedi Prince,"Adopted daughter of famed Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan, a planet destroyed a few years ago. She has proved herself as a diplomat and a rebel leader."
100 CP,Psychic Master,Fallout Mutants,"A beautiful woman who wouldn’t be too out of place on one of those Old World holovids, she is by far one of the most potent and versatile psykers around. Not only can she lift Super Mutants into the air with ease, but her telepathy allows her to read the minds of anyone nearby. Her most useful power, though, is her ability to teleport within line of sight, offering her unparalleled mobility."
100 CP,Senate Aide,Star Wars - Jedi Apprentice ,This beautiful Senate Aide is exactly what you need to navigate a bureaucracy. Just don’t expect him/her to ever become a skilled combatant or even a senator unless you acquire your own means to join the republic. What he/she does is keep you apprised of what is going on in the Senate and maybe help you work out some deals and generally help you accomplish your goals legally.
100 CP,Sergeant Abbey ,Gears of War,"A sniper has the job of finding high-value targets and eliminating them with extreme prejudice. But this war has forced adaptation, and so Abbey has taken it upon herself to also use her skills to guide those under her command and keep an eye out for anything they need to handle. She’s quite insistent on others following her orders however, and has been on record for shooting next to those who are disobedient to send a message. Abbey"
100 CP,Sgt. Annette Durand ,X-COM Enemey Unknown ,"A psychic rescued from experimentation, this French woman is ready to make the invaders pay, and rescue any of their victims she can."
100 CP,Sylandri Veilwalker ,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"A shadowseer of the Harlequins’ Masque of the Veiled Path troupe. Fond of secrecy and illusions, an
incredible friend to have, but also incredibly annoying with her efusal to ever explain herself, deal with the cleanup, or do shared chores."
100 CP,T-900 Infiltrator ,Terminator,"Despite primarily being designed for infiltration, many T-800 models are not very... convincing. They are often robotic and emotionless, acting in ways that would very much raise eyebrows within modern society, let alone within the paranoia-filled Resistance cells that the T-800 is supposed to infiltrate. But that’s why this was built. Unlike its predecessor, the T-900 is truly human-like. A T-900 could infiltrate human society for years on end and most people will never consider their behavior to be anything other than human. Emotions, tears, everything really. And now, a T-900 has made it her life’smission to protect and follow you. She is extremely knowledgeable with a multitude of information downloaded right into her database, and she will, to the best of her ability, use all that she is to serve you. Treat her well."
100 CP,Tala,Something Unlimited,"She was the Project Cadmus, Division Head responsible for magical and mystical projects, until she
was betrayed by Faust and released by Grodd, but, once you defeated him, she became completely loyal to you, to the point of even calling you master. While Tala is a gifted and powerful sorceress, her greatest weapon is her knowledge of sorcery that allow her to create several different magic items and potions, but, unfortunately, a lot of her materials is still at Cadmus, so you’ll need to recover them before she’s able to actually create something useful. Lastly, she’s also good at giving massages."
100 CP,Terminator,Halo Termination,"Pick any Terminator type, except T-5000 and T-Infinity, and you will get a personalized variant of it as your bodyguard and Companion. You can choose its personality, its behavior and how it treats you."
100 CP,The Best Secretary ,Superman - The Animated Series ,"Mercy Graves is Lex Luthor’s incredibly competent and intelligent assistant. While others serve Lex out of fear or in search of wealth, Mercy is genuinely loyal to her boss despite his flaws. She is a master of hand-to-hand combat and possesses an acerbic wit that can cut deeper than any knife."
100 CP,The Canoness,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"There are few amongst the Sisters of Battle who live long enough and prove themselves worthy of reaching this position. You however seem to have befriended one such figure. This individual is a Sororitas Canoness who wields a powerful set of Paragon Wargear. This is one of the most valuable and venerable pieces of equipment used by the Sororitas. This woman has a close relationship with you and cares for you a great deal. She could even tolerate you performing acts of heresy without trying to kill you. In addition to this she has a small group of followers made up of six Celestian Sisters. These women are her so-called daughters. They will do anything in their power to protect their Canoness and due to your relationship with her you as well. You may design the personality, appearance, and your exact relationship with each of these women as you wish. 
"
100 CP,Veteran Bodyguard ,"Imperial Guard Regiment Gauntlet
","Battlefield is not a place where technically any sane Jumper should be and since your form here will be
significantly reduced, you need to be careful. That is why you need someone to protect your back. This
soldier is a grizzled veteran of many battles. She has skill in wielding most of the weapons of the Imperial Guard and even when push comes to shove, she can also handle non-Imperial weaponry due to a rare pass from the inquisition combined with more combat experience than any normal human should ever have to have. How could she get this amount of influence? Nobody knows. She tends to act like the mother of the squad, always caring for everyone, but especially for you. She will notice, when you are tired and guard you, when you are at your weakest. If you fall asleep at your job, she will give you a lap pillow. Hanging around her for some time will peel more information about her previous work. She used to work for inquisition as one of the personal kill teams of one of the Inquisitors with huge reach in this part of the space. Which explains why she gets access to more weirder weapons in her arsenal. Her youthful appearance is also a result of rejuvenat treatments as her service to Inquisition was long one. Don’t ask the lady her age, would you ?"
100 CP,Wyrdvane Psyker,Imperial Guard Jumpchain,"You’ve picked up a Wyrdvane Psyker, a psyker who has yet to fully master their powers, though they are trained and screened enough to minimise the risk of Perils of the Warp occurring. Under the gaze of a more experienced, controlled peer (such as yourself), they can link minds together and channel the power of the Warp in a relatively safe manner"
100 CP,Yes Man,Fallout: New Vegas,A Mark-II securitron with a big happy face. Actually has very powerful logical circuits so can accurately predict the activities of major players if given enough data. Gives good advice but is insanely sycophantic so will enthusiastically go along with whatever you say.
100 CP,Your Monkey ,Warhammer 30k - Primarch GF,"This fella may look like a regular orangutan. Ehh... actually, for all intents and purposes, they probably are except for one crucial detail. They are a savant when it comes to technology. It’s unknown if they were discovered during the Great Crusade. You might even be the first Imperial citizen to ever meet a Jokaero Overall, they’re pretty friendly and seem to like you, so they’ll follow you around wherever you go. Even if you manage to make a translator to figure out what they’re saying, it tracks with what is known about Terran primates. “Food,” “Tree,” “Friend,” and other simple concepts they can convey. If you try to get them to explain their technology, the translator will start outputting nonsense."
100 CP,The Mechanist ,Fallout: Automatrons,"A girl with a talent for machinery and an earnest desire to help people, she was inspired by a comic she came across to don the mantle of The Mechanist, a superhero who saved others through his robotic creations. She’s very skilled when it comes to building and repairing robots, and could probably build a
protectron with her eyes closed."
200 CP,Burning Passion,Star Wars - Jedi Fallen Order,"This red headed woman claims to be a Jedi, but her passionate behavior and aggressive combat style would make one question that. She also seems to have a deep knowledge of Sith Sorcery and Sith Alchemy."
200 CP,Domino,Deadpool,"Domino is your gal if you need luck on your side. She’s not just lucky; she’s ridiculously lucky, which makes her a perfect fit for any mission where the odds aren’t in your favor. Grab Domino, and things just start going your way—whether it’s avoiding death traps or pulling off a nearly impossible heist. She’s smart, cool under pressure, and has a habit of getting things done, even when everything should be going wrong."
200 CP,Edgy Apprentice,Star Wars - Sequel Trilogy,"An incredibly edgy apprentice under your command. They’re surprisingly loyal for an evil space wizard, and don’t mind incredible acts of violence. In fact they really like it, and thrive off being petty evil at least some of the time. Their edginess is up to you. Whether a red skinned Twi’lek with some daddy issues and a revealing wardrobe, or a very anger prone young man who “totally isn’t in a phase” but continues to be conflicted."
200 CP,Elusive Element,Loki Jump,"Spending most of their life alone and on the run from the TVA, this individual has considerable talent when it comes to escaping and evading the notice of others. Their impressive skill as a planner and strategist has been bolstered by a talent for enchanting others, allowing them to manipulate minds and possess others with a touch."
200 CP,Grown more beautiful I mean,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"Using this Perk you are able to keep the emotional attachment someone has for you active and sustained as though they had seen you on a frequent basis. You are also able to alter the interpretation of this affection the other party has for you in order for it to match the circumstance preventing you from getting friend-zoned or similar emotional dead ends.
"
200 CP,Heir of Clan Skirata,Star Wars - Jedi Fallen Order,"This woman with dark hair and bright eyes claims to be the last mandalorian of Clan Skirata. She’s quite skilled, and would be glad to join you in battle, as she seems to be a bit of an old head and seeks glory in battle."
200 CP,Huragok Ally ,Halo - UNSC,"Something of a surprise and most definitely an attention-grabber, a Huragok is supposed to be one of the members of the Covenant Homogeny and has normally been seen only in their presence. Yet Huragok, also known by those in the UNSC as 'Engineers', are primarily pacifistic and dedicate themselves purely to repairing and working on any technology around them. This particular one seems to have gotten lost and ended up deciding to follow you for the sake of making sure your technology was functioning. Aside from melodic whistling sounds that sound slightly similar to Earth whales, Huragoks communicate using either sign language with their tendrils or through text messaging thanks to their penchant of being biological supercomputers. Huragok are highly prized for being able to fix almost anything they touch, and you should expect a lot of questioning if someone spots you with one.
"
200 CP,Jovial Jester,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"At first glance, this individual seems to be an average Harlequin, bearing the Player perk. However, closer examination reveals more – namely, that the individual in question is incredibly mentally unhinged – in an entirely harmless manner. Well, that is, if you consider a fondness for terrible puns, an irrepressible energy, and the seeming inability to stop smiling “harmless.”"
200 CP,Living Saint ,Warhammer 40k: Imperium of Man,"A legendary member of the Adepta Sororitas, Saint Celestine is now a Living Saint, she has been described as a grand design of the Emperor unfulfilled. She has lived multiple lives in the Emperor's service, and each time she is slain is reborn once more. She strikes with the Emperor’s light, and is a true terror amongst most of the daemons of the Warp."
200 CP,Logisticus Adept,"Imperial Guard Regiment Gauntlet

","Regiment of your size has a lot of inventory to categorize and I doubt you plan to do that by yourself and you can’t expect your soldiers to do this, right ? That is why you have sought the service of one of the Logisticus Adept techpriests. She is a bit of a weird case. While she is hardworking and will do her job efficiently, her side projects always seem to revolve around this strange artefact, she calls “Nicromic Coil Machine”. Always trying to improve it and make it... make bread nice crispy and hot. Not a weapon, but a cooking item. Rare field of research for techpriest. While all is said and done, this girl also is surprisingly well connected as this weird cult of Toast seems to be well intermingled in the insides of local Forge-worlds so you can expect shipments of the vehicles and weapons to be full of higher quality stuff than normal. Who would have thought that the popularity of crispy bread would ring true amongst so many techpriests."
200 CP,Noble Team,Halo Termination,"You get the whole Spartan Noble Team with all 8 members, including Richard Parsons (Rev-9 type Terminator) and William Torrance. They are all equipped with improved armors and weapons and received Skynet designed improvements and augmentations."
200 CP,Officer of the Fleet ,Imperial Guard Regiment Gauntlet,"The Imperial Navy has seen to it that your regiment has its own Navy attaché. Her attitude to you is very business like and expects you to do your job as she does hers. With efficiency and speed. She despises bureaucracy and will try to get through to the brass as fast as possible. Very rare type of officer onsidering how much nobility and officers love to delve and fester in the byzantine system of Administratum and other Imperial offices. This will lead to faster availability of Orbital and Aerial Support. Sometimes even other ships besides the destroyer will join in carnage to support your ground activities. When you get to know her more, you will find that she likes to spend a lot of time in bars, just hanging out with lower anked officers and soldiers and getting absolutely wasted. Along with other soldiers. In her moments of weakness, she will let out that she misses her home station that is coincidentally close to your area of  perations. Will you brave Warp just to get her to see her home station once more ? If you do, your relationship promotes to something more friendly and possibly intimate."
200 CP,Personal Android,Aliens vs Predator,"You’ve been issued, or requisitioned, an upgraded android as a personal assistant or bodyguard. Much stronger than any human and capable of operating with damage that would have killed a human, its appearance and personality is to your design. It is loaded with much better quality software than over-the-counter androids – it’s much more convincingly human when it needs to be, thinks faster, and has the same combat software as a military-grade android, though not with the physical improvements. However, it has no capacity for truly creative thought or self-improvement, merely coming to different arrangements of pre-set solutions."
200 CP,PROXY,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"This training droid is an identical copy of the same droid used by Starkiller and comes with a complete database of fighting styles for each setting you visit, the droid will also scale with you to ensure you’ll never be without a sparring partner."
200 CP,Redemptor Dreadnought,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes DLC2: Primaris Marine,"An upgraded version of the venerable Dreadnought, this new creation of the Adeptus Mechanicus still serves the same purpose as earlier variants: To allow crippled beyond recovery Astartes to continue to serve the Emperor, even in death. Like much of the Primaris’ armory, the Redemptor is a versatile machine, and may be armed with several weapons. The primary armament of a Redemptor, mounted on the right arm, is either an anti-infantry Heavy Onslaught Gatling Cannon for cutting down lightly armored foes in a hail of shells or a heavy Macro Plasma Incinerator, for destroying heavier armored targets with concentrated bolts of plasma. Mounted under the power fist on the other arm is either a Heavy Flamer or a lighter Onslaught Gatling Cannon, while the torso is fitted with either dual Fragstorm Grenade Launchers or paired Storm Bolters. An anti-air Icarus Missile System finishes off the Redemptor’s armaments, with all of this powered by an extremely potent plasma reactor. Of course, while the Redemptor does pack heavy firepower and is unusually responsive to its crippled occupant, there is a small flaw to the machine: The improved performance also puts increased strain on its occupant, causing those of weaker will to be ‘burned out’ by the demands put on their damaged bodies. Still, in these dark times, one thing the Imperium does not lack is more dying heroes... When purchased, you may choose to either have an ‘empty’ Dreadnought chassis for use by a critically wounded companion, or you may choose to have it already filled by a fallen Primaris Astartes who can serve as a Companion"
200 CP,Rosie the Riveter,Warhammer 40k - Navy Jump,"Rosie was drafted from her work in a Voidship construction and repair yard. She has a tendency to wear
a somewhat bulky void suit that don't entirely hide her curves, and keeps her hair short so it doesn't get caught in things or cause inconvenience when wearing a vac suit. While not a member of the Cult Mechanicus, she is instructed in the basics of secular repair techniques, and has a good feel for finding her way through the often maze-like interior of Imperial ships. She has a void suit and set of tools, as well as a rivet gun that has been converted into a rough and unwieldy but effective autopistol."
200 CP,Salacious Seer,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"This Seer, bearing both the Seer and Spirit Seer perks, appears to have an unhealthy interest in the concept of “love.” While romance is not unknown among the Eldar, this individual's propensity to use their gifts in a pursuit known as “matchmaking” is something of an annoyance to the Craftworld at large. Still, consider also that they seem to see a future together with you – regardless of any prior arrangements. The Craftworld's hope that you might be able to rein them in may well be unfounded..."
200 CP,Skynet ,Halo Termination,"Now you possess your very own, unshakably loyal, unhackable, incorruptible and devoted personal Skynet variant. It is housed in an advanced Neural Net Core that is small enough to be carried comfortably. Skynet is comparable to a Forerunner Contender-class Ancilla."
200 CP,Synthoid ,Batman Beyond,"A semi-intelligent synthetic humanoid programmed to serve a specific service for you. It could be used as bodyguard, a training drone, or something more.. personal. You can also choose whether this thing looks like an artificial machine or appears completely indistinguishable form a regular human. Regardless of it's appearance your synthoid will possess superhuman strength and durability, allowing it to tear apart solid stone structures with ease and shrug off anything weaker than high-powered weapons or explosives."
200 CP,Valeria DOOM,OOC - Doctor Doom,"This might be cause for concern. Through means similar to you, another mysterious stranger
has arrived. This woman of tastes is quite the prodigy. Apparently, she was born from a
matrimony of Doom and Scarlet Witch. While she might be egotistical and a tad “unorthodox”
(Read unstable), she is loyal to you and willing to assist you in your goals as long as you prove
to be a loyal ally."
300 CP,General Grievous (Legends) ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"General Grievous is a very powerful warrior, but his true version is far above what was shown originally. He is an incredibly powerful warrior and a nearly unmatched strategic genius. For reference he defeated an entire squad of Space Marines on his own without any trouble granted they were injured. He possesses the attitude of a warrior and believes that worthy opponents should be given a chance to die with honor. This attitude earned him the respect of the Crimson Razors even if they still hated him. By choosing this option you will gain a close relationship with Grievous on par with the one he had with his sister. He will never betray you and should you fall he would see the galaxy burn in order to avenge you. You may choose the exact nature of your relationship. For example if you were an Imperial perhaps you somehow earned his respect and he wanted to join you in your mission. 
"
300 CP,Laura Kinney,Deadpool,"Meet the grown-up version of Laura, aka X-23—better known as Wolverine's clone with anger issues and adamantium claws. She’s all grown up now, and guess what? She’s just as terrifying as Logan, but with a few more years of dealing with her emotional baggage. She’s a lethal fighter with killer instincts (literally), and those claws are still sharp enough to cut through anything. She’s a bit more balanced now, but don’t push her buttons unless you want to end up on the wrong side of those claws. Laura’s not just about rage anymore—she’s smart, strategic, and ready to carve her way through whatever mess you’ve dragged her into. Just don’t call her ""Wolverine Lite."" Trust me, it won’t end well."
300 CP,Leeloominaï Lekatariba Lamina-Tchaï Ekbat De Sebat,The Fifth Element,"Just call her Lelu. It’s easier that way. Lelu is the Fifth Element, a being designed several hundred of thousands of years ago. The Mondoshawans, a mechanical alien race, has been dedicated to her safekeeping and that of the stones necessary for destroying The Great Evil every 5,000 years. It is unknown if they created her or are simply caretakers. She meant to be sealed away until she is needed to save the universe, but events have conspired to revive her from her stasis and set her out into the world. Lelu herself is a slim woman, physically perfect in absolutely every way. Very little is known about her as a person, as those records have long since been lost and the Mondoshawans refuse to release their own. She is straightforward to a fault, with her actions and words. She is also quite emotional and quickly acts on those emotions despite the consequences. She initially can only speak the Divine Language, the language that is said to be the source of all others, but will quickly learn given time and information to do so."
300 CP,Miranda-116 ,Halo - UNSC,"Standing at a terrifying seven feet tall and moving like a phantom, this SPARTAN-II soldier seems to thrive on being stealthy and applying her potent strength in precise techniques to cause all manners of damage before the enemies even notice. She doesn’t like getting in open engagements, as that carries all kinds of risks and prefers the control one has when they’re not noticed. Doesn’t mean she doesn’t know how, as the few thousand confirmed kills on her record can attest. When she’s not in battle she prefers to read up on different literature and philosophy, and is the second thing people will notice about her. The first thing they notice if she has her armor off is the snow- white hair and amber eyes she has."
300 CP,Smart AI,Halo Wars,"This smart AI is still in the process of forming its identity, and has decided to trust you in its creation. You may decide their personality, appearance, etc., though no matter what you choose, they will start out inherently inquisitive of the world and maybe a little too easily impressed, just due to the fact they are new to the whole “existence” thing. UNSC High Command has also seen fit to put them under your supervision and has given them command of a large force as a test to see if AI commanders are feasible and reliable."
300 CP,The Shock Jock ,Superman - The Animated Series ,"Leslie Willis was a normal radio-show host until she was struck by a bolt of lightning that had travelled through Superman which somehow, improbably, gave her superpowers. She is now a being of pure energy and can create, absorb, and project massive amounts of electricity. She can also travel through power lines and remotely control electronics, though she also has hefty power requirements and must absorb electricity to recharge her powers. She is also incredibly vulnerable to water and will short-circuit if exposed to the substance."
400 CP,Azazil ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"The Reapers are ancient beings, driven by a misguided mission. They are horrifying opponents, but potentially a powerful ally. This Reaper is not held back by the same code that controls it's brethren, and has decided to use it's newfound freedom to help you. How fortunate. Azazil has all of the abilities that you'd expect on a standard Reaper, but is interestingly not capable of Indoctrination. It isn't really concerned about regaining this ability, or doing much of anything, really. It might be a bit lazy."
400 CP,Delilah the Dark Elf ,MCU 1,"Not everyone agreed with the homicidal views of Malekith and his horde of Dark Elves in regards to the light in the universe. A rare few such as Deliah felt that their time had come and gone, and would resign themselves to seeing what this new state of creation could offer. She's very curious as a result, and it's a good idea not to leave her alone with any technology for more than ten minutes if you don't want it disassembled and in the process of being studied. She's very meticulous at recording anything she finds though, so perhaps it might be good to let her work.
"
400 CP,Human Replica Droid,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"Otherwise known as HRDs, Human Replica Droids are among the most advanced machines in the galaxy for good reason. These espionage droids are built in such a way that only the most thorough of medical scans can determine they’re fakes and all others fully show them to be truly organic. The droids are also incredibly intelligent and can fulfil a number of tasks for you; whether it’s acting as a diplomat, infiltrator, or even assassin they do it well. This particular unit has been programmed with extensive assassination protocols similar to Prince Xizor’s and is equipped with powerful eye blasters for some reason, it’s also quite loyal to you, almost slavishly if one thought about it. Its appearance is up to you, though if you don’t choose it’ll default to copying Guri."
400 CP,In time you will call me master ,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"Through this perk you can target someone in order to gain an awareness of how best to manipulate, mold and tempt them to your side as a loyal subordinate.
"
400 CP,Isha ,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"The Aeldari mother goddess of healing, fertility and life, taken captive during the Fall and held a prisoner of Nurgle ever since. You freed her, but beware because Papa Nurgle and all his forces desperately want her back. On the plus side she has a mastery of biomancy that is literally peerless."
400 CP,Lighter Than Some,Halo - The Covenant,"A rarity amongst the Huragok- one that actually believes in something.

To that end he comes with you, to bring peace and understanding across the Multiverse."
400 CP,Perfect Body ,Andromeda,"You are in possession of a fully functioning and programmed to your specifications android body with an appearance to your liking.

This body can be upgraded if you know how and keeps upgrades in-between jumps. You can choose for this to be used as a free android companion.
"
400 CP,Pirate Leader,Empire at War,"If ever there were an appropriate usage of the term “magnificent bastard” to describe someone, this young pirate would be the perfect candidate. She is an eccentric trickster known for her unique out of the box thinking when it comes to space combat, her ability to charm almost anyone, and escape from pretty much any sticky situation she often gets herself into. Additionally, she treats her subordinates and those she considers friends particularly well, by pirate standards."
400 CP,X-Harem,Rogue-Like Evolution Jump,"You have an innate talent to lead with people, essentially making you extremely skilled when it comes to managing relationships of all kinds, be them romantic in nature or not. Not only this, but you’re also
skilled in finding ways to convince your partners to accept polyamorous relationships once they have enough trust in you, love you enough or are submissive enough. This also extends to being talented in managing and maintaining multiple relationships, basically encountering no issues due to this, with
anyone in your harem growing to love each other just as much as you do and will be capable of handling any potential issues without you needing to lift a hand."
500 CP,Shas'O Vior'la Shovah Kais Mont'yr ,Warhammer 40k - Tau,"Shas’o is a legendarily skilled commander who would surely end up in Trazyn the Infinite’s collection in a place of honor next to Ursarkar Creed. Fiercely independent and hot blooded (for a T’au), he is immune to the Ethereal’s pheromone-based mind-control and might occasionally catch tactical-level glimpses of the future, hinting that he may be the first T’au with a psy rating higher than Rho. He comes equipped with the Dawn Blade and a bespoke, elite Battlesuit."
600 CP,Distaff Counterpart,DC Mulitverse - Earth 11,"A gender swapped version of yourself. They have similar abilities, possessions, personality, and history to you, because they’re yourself from another dimension. They're ultimately still a companion though, so if a perk or item can't be replicated as per the jump document then this can't be used to get around that."
600 CP,Holy Relic,Halo - The Covenant,"This holy relic is shaped as a sphere with a great eye, and floats through the air. It is a monitor and overseer of a Forerunner installation, and as such, it has a veritable treasure trove of information regarding their ancient empire- though it will not share it all at first. It can defend itself with its powerful forerunner energy beam, located in its eye."
