100 CP, Cycler Rifle,Star Wars - The Orginal Trilogy ,"The standard projectile weapon used by the Tusken Raiders of Tatooine. This slugthrower, a rare type of weapon that fires solid projectiles, features a long range scope and an energizer that lets it's projectiles penetrate shields."
100 CP,40-Watt Phased Plasma Rifle,Terminator,"As mankind was quick to realize, ballistic weaponry proved to be less than effective against the machines that SkyNet had at its disposal. Which is why they had this. A plasma rifle. This plasma rifle fires off bolts of plasma at a speed over Mach 25 and with a rate of fire that far surpasses most common ballistic weapons. These bolts of plasma are capable of punching through over a quarter of a meter of case-hardened steel. A direct hit from this rifle is almost certainly guaranteed to put down any organic target, whether it be through the explosion caused by the plasma or the shot itself. Even a near miss is deadly, capable of inflicting 3rd degree burns and any splash damage from it is about as dangerous as a traditional grenade. As for ammunition, you’ll never need to worry about that. This thing has unlimited ammunition. All you have to worry about is overheating which means it needs to cool off every one or two hundred shots. Still, this is a powerful weapon indeed. Go put down some Terminators, would you?"
100 CP,Ascension Gun ,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"This S-5 heavy blaster pistol was modified to be able to fire a grappling hook attached to a tether, allowing the wielder to cross a horizontal gap or make a vertical climb. The blaster itself has a heavy wooden grip stock and twin scopes for sighting and rangefinding. The blaster also features a dart launcher underneath the main barrel, able to fire either an anesthetic micro dart, a sting charge, or the grappling hook’s tip.
"
100 CP,Black Pack,Lexx,"This handheld weapon fires black webs of energy from a pair of prongs attached to the handle. Organic targets struck by these energy webs are disintegrated instantly. The battery pack on this one, which is connected to the handle by a length of cable and typically worn at the waist, will never run out of charge."
100 CP,Brace,Lexx,"This versatile, wrist mounted weapon is the signature tool of the Divine Assassins. The weapon consists of two fold-out blades arranged like an insect’s mandibles attached to a retractable cord. Despite the blades being sharp enough to sever limbs outright and punch through a person’s rib cage to cut their heart in two, it is possible to use them as grasping implements without damaging your target. The cord can extend to significant lengths and retracts quickly on demand, letting the device serve as a grappling hook that can let you ascend even the tallest buildings. When launched, the weapon makes a sound similar to the call of a hawk."
100 CP,Collapsible Staff ,Batman Beyond,"A metal quarterstaff that can be collapsed down to about the size of a large bottle. Good for beating up dangerous people, traversing hazardous environments, and stopping big heavy doors."
100 CP,Digi-Multi Lasers,Imperium Nihilus ,"Popular amongst Rogue Traders, Inquisitors and the rest of high society, digital weapons, or digi-weapons if you prefer, are miniaturized weapons, often built into things such as rings or other jewelry, hence the name. Digi- weapons cannot be crafted by most of the Imperium and so, they are more often created by the Jokaero, a strange race of ape-like xenos with tremendous technological knowledge and capabilities. As small as they may be, they are nonetheless just as powerful as their full-sized counterparts. And your variant is a step above even that. By combining the potency of plasma, melta, and las energy into a beam of destructive force, you have a weapon that can easily punch through even a Land Raider. It’s unfortunate that you only get one shot a day and it doesn’t stock up. Still, that single shot can work wonders if you use it right."
100 CP,DL-44,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"This heavy blaster pistol offers above-average firepower without compromising accuracy, and is easily modifiable.
"
100 CP,E-11 Medium Blaster Rifle,Star Wars: Death Troopers Gauntlet,"A standard blaster rifle of the Imperial Military. This is a highly versatile rifle that combines long range and high power, with a compact design. Its capacity is 200 shots per standard power cell or 500 shots per standard plasma pack. "
100 CP,Electrostaff,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"This staff-like melee weapon was designed for single combat against lightsaber-wielders such as Jedi, and is plated in phrik alloy that gives it the ability to block lightsaber strikes. Each end of the staff is tipped with purple or yellow electricity, which was powerful enough to stop a being's heart after five seconds of contact.
"
100 CP,Grenades,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"What's better than shooting something? Making something explode! This pouch has so many explosives stored away that you'd think that it has infinite grenades (hint: it does), and at least one of every kind. Frag grenades, incendiary grenades, smoke grenades, EMP grenades, flash grenades, but one of the most fun ones is the mass grenade, utilizing Eezo to make everything that isn't nailed down within fifteen feet of the blast float helplessly in the air, making for easy targets."
100 CP,Gun Nut,Fallout 3,"If there's one companion that you can unequivocally trust, it's a gun. Big guns, small guns, shotguns, miniguns, there's so many kinds out there that it's hard to choose. It doesn't really matter to you, as any gun you use will hit harder, fly farther, and punch through targets easier than before.."
100 CP,Haywire Grenades ,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"Others may sneer at your ‘primitive’ and ‘quaint’ ways. But who will be laughing after
your EMP grenades turn their fancy vehicles and sophisticated thinking machines into massive paperweights, hmm? Six Haywire grenades, replenished weekly."
100 CP,Helfrost Gun ,Imperium Nihilus ,"Hailing from the world of Fenris, home of the Space Wolves, Helfrost weapons are a rather unique and interesting tool of war. You could even consider it as a sort of counterpart to the famed Melta weapons so often used by Guardsmen and Space Marines alike. Whereas as a Melta fires off a short-ranged beam of concentrated heat, the Helfrost instead unleashes a short-ranged beam of the purest cold. And with this pistol, you and your foes will know just how deadly the cold can be. Once struck by the beam, flesh blackens and shatters with catastrophic frostbite and armor offers no protection, buckling and cracking as frost spreads from the point of impact. And unless your poor foes can fight their way free, they shall find themselves as a withered revenant forever imprisoned within a jagged and never-melting tomb of ice and frost."
100 CP,Isotope Weapon ,Terminator,"Designed by a time traveler known only as the “Engineer”, the isotope weapon is a rifle
built from scavenged parts around 1963. It is, in a sense, a powerful plasma rifle that
allows for a variety of firing modes. Through the magnets around the chamber, the
plasma can be shaped into a cylinder, a bullet set to be fired off, one capable of blasting
apart a T-888. And you have the choice to fire off the plasma as either a single slug or a
pulse. You have not only the weapon but also the blueprints for it."
100 CP,IW Weapon ,Earth Final Conflict,"The first practical Information Warfare weapon, a clumsy-looking tri barreled rifle with rubbery fins. Human technology generates an EMP, while the Taelon additions properly contain and channel it into an adjustable precise beam. You can stop a car, or blackout a single building, fry thecomms of a platoon, all without creating problems for your own kit."
100 CP,Jawa Ionization Blaster ,Star Wars - The Orginal Trilogy ,A makeshift weapon created by the Jawas. This blaster can temporarily shut down droids with a powerful electric shock. Any organic it hits will only receive a minor zap.
100 CP,Je'daii Katana ,Star Wars - Tales of the Jedi,"Before the coming of the Force Hound Xesh, the Je’daii wielded swords that look remarkably similar to japanese katanas. These weapons were empowered by alchemy, making it preternaturally strong and sharp. This one, through the grace of the Benefactor, is even tougher, and cannot be easily sundered, even by a Force Saber. While a Katana is the most common form, your weapon could take the form of any one or 2 handed unpowered melee weapon"
100 CP,Laser Pistol,Fallout 3,"Intended to replace the N99 pistol as the standard sidearm for military forces, the AEP7 laser pistol is a good choice to have at your sides. This energy weapon may not be the most deadly, but it's good to keep by your side."
100 CP,Lightning Maul,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"Really, it’s a Thunderhammer, but from an age when only Squats had them. Really, it’d be rude not to use their name. But seriously, it’s a Thunderhammer."
100 CP,M-134 Minigun,Terminator,"Ah. The M-134 minigun. A classic staple of action movies everywhere. Now you get the
chance to experience it all for yourself. Ordinarily, such a firearm would be far too heavy
and unwieldy to fire without being mounted onto a vehicle, you’ll find that you’ll have no
trouble lifting and firing this gun, being to practically weightless to you. Others will not
have that luxury. Capable of firing 6,000 bullets a minute, bullets going over twice the
speed of sound and capable of penetrating walls as easily as it blows holes in men. Not
only that but you’ll also find that you never need to worry about reloading this gun. This
thing has infinite ammunition. You can keep firing this until the barrel starts melting."
100 CP,M41A Pulse Rifle,Aliens vs Predator,"“I wanna introduce you to a personal friend of mine. This is an M41A pulse rifle. Ten
millimeter with over-and-under thirty millimeter pump action grenade launcher.”
The original green machine. USCM standard issue. Round counter on the side – holds 99 caseless AP rounds and four grenades. Whether it’s bugs or Preds, you can count on
this baby to perforate it."
100 CP,Master Crafted Bolt Pistol ,"Warhammer 40k: Ciaphas Cain, Hero of the Imperium",A Bolt Pistol is a smaller version of the Bolter in standard use by the Space Marines and other Imperial forces such as the Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas and certain members of the Astra Militarum and the Imperial Navy. Purchasing this grants you a master crafted Bolt pistol. It will come with a supply of unlimited ammo and will be repaired if you somehow damage it.
100 CP,Necromonger Weapons,Riddick,"You gain a pistol and assault rifle that fire compressed gravity, these have essentially infinite ammo and are extremely durable. A single shot is capable of making a persons head explode so use with caution."
100 CP,Nth Metal Weapon,Justice League: Unlimited,A powerful piece of alien equipment. This melee weapon of choice cackles with high amounts of electricity from a small unnoticeable generator (It can be toggled on and off with but a thought.) It is stupidly durable able to even smack around powerful magic beings with relative ease due to its anti-magic properties. Like any weapon it's only as deadly as its user. Don't worry about it breaking down. It won't.
100 CP,Personal Death Ray ,Girl Genius ,"Not quite the masterpiece Agatha made that could vaporize stone, this is nonetheless an
excellent weapon of great killing potential. The specific nature, from a laser to a lightning
discharger to a hyper-focused flamethrower is up to you."
100 CP,Phase Pistol ,Star Trek - Enterprise,"Or potentially a disruptor or similar device. The preferred weapon of the 22nd Century, this compact
energy weapon has virtually limitless shots and a stun setting."
100 CP,Photon Grenades ,Imperium Nihilus ,"The perfect way to disorient your foes. Once triggered, these detonate with an eye-searing blast of light and sound, light so strong that, without any protection, ordinary humans can suffer permanent ocular damage and even light-sensitive equipment can break through the sheer influx of newfound light. It’s so bright that it will even reflect of off both plasteel and concrete, making sure that even those who turn their backs against the explosion shall be affected. Maybe these should’ve been called blind grenades instead."
100 CP,Power Axe ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,A better axe that can chop through most materials not protected with a power field.
100 CP,Pulse Rifle,Farscape,"A standard issue Peacekeeper pulse rifle. Its reliable, accurate, and easy to keep in peak condition."
100 CP,Qualta Blade,Farscape,A broadsword that can turn into a pulse rifle. Its weight makes it difficult for the small and weak to use it well as a sword and the lack of a scope can make it difficult to shoot distant targets. 
100 CP,Raygun ,Flash Gordon,"The standard weapon of Mongo, though most prefer the sword. Point and click, make things dead or on fire"
100 CP,Staff of Light​ ,Warhammer 40k - Necrons,"The badge of office of Necron Nobility, this weapon does not follow the same principles as the baseline Gauss Weaponry of the Necrons. Instead, it absorbs energy from thin air to release in the form of bolts of lightning. A devastating weapon at range, and the fractal edged blade on the tip makes it a nightmare to face in close combat as well. Let none doubt your authority with this weapon."
100 CP,Swordsman ,Equilibrium,"You are skilled in the art of swordsmanship, practiced in the forms and easily a match for the casual swordfighter. Though you do this primarily as a focus exercise, you have still spent thousands of hours drilling the forms and sparring against other clerics."
100 CP,Taser-Tractor-Binder Gun,Total Recall,"This gun fires an electrified rope that wraps around the target, delivering mild electroshocks  nd entangling their limbs. The gun can also exert a tractor-field that draws anyone bound in the rope towards the gun, without exerting a countervailing force on the person holding the gun."
100 CP,Vibroknife,Star Wars – Darth Bane,"A serrated vibrating knife, this weapon has been treated in a small nexus of the Dark Side. You may manipulate its polarity to deflect blasters shots and the edge is guaranteed to never dull from use. Beyond that, this is just an extremely sharp knife that oscillates to part the flesh or steel or your enemies with ease."
100 CP,Webber ,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"A pistol firing balls of compressed wire from the giant spiders common to Maiden Worlds. On impact, the webbing explodes in all directions, trapping entire squads if aimed carefully."
100 CP,Yaka Arrow,Marvel - What If,"Whistle while you work! This strange bronze arrow is made from Yaka metal, which responds to specific sonic frequencies. Most famously employed by Yondu of the Ravagers, an arrow like this could make rapid course corrections, punching through obstacles, enemies, and even starship hulls when given the right tones. With a little practice, you’ll be as proficient as the Centaurian himself! The added red prosthetic fin is cool looking, but optional."
100 CP,Zap o’ matic ,Destroy All Humans,This rifle sized weapon fires a constant stream of electricity that arcs between targets and can wipe entire squads out in just a few seconds. Features a recharging battery that will top itself off with just a few moments pause.
200 CP,Alien Blaster ,X-Men - The Animated Series,"You possess a gun from the future, another dimension, or another planet. Whatever the nature it shoots beams of energy which are weaker than those of the Energy Blast power. You can choose whether it is a small hold-out weapon, a handgun, or a big two handed weapon with significant recoil, with the larger the weapon the more powerful the blast. No matter what it caps out roughly at strong enough to destroy a civilian vehicle."
200 CP,Ballistic Fist,Fallout Series,"While normal power fists are awesome, do you know what's even better? A power fist with a shotgun attached to it! That's right, as soon as you hit a target with the fist part, it unleashes a shotgun blast, greatly increasing any damage you might do. You do need to be strong in order to handle the recoil, but at least you never need to reload it."
200 CP,Blob Cannons,The Incredibles,"If you want to have great security, but would rather capture intruders alive instead... These cannons firing very sticky and rapidly expanding balls of tar will do the job quite well even when the intruder is a super-strong and nigh invulnerable superhero. You get the plans for them, instructions on how to make the blobs, as well as the option to have them installed in your Warehouse and any other properties you may have."
200 CP,Canary Cry,DC - Arrowverse,Surprise! Yet another weapon created by Cisco Ramon. This time it was for Team Arrow's Black Canary. This powerful sonic weapon take shape of a lovely collar. It has a fairly long range and is strong enough to shatter glass and blast adult males several feet through the air.
200 CP,Hellgun,Imperium Nihilus ,"When it comes to power, the lasgun is often mocked, derided for not having the strength of a bolter, the might of a plasma gun, or even the killing heat of a melta. And there is some truth to those statements. After all, it doesn’t need to be powerful when there’s a hundred of them all firing at once. But you won’t always have the luxury of numbers. Which is where this comes in. Thanks to the upgraded power-pack and more refined construction, your lasgun is more than a glorified flashlight, punching through even ceramite with ease."
200 CP,HoloWhip ,Red Dwarf,A whip made out of energy that can hurt a hologram. Not lethal at current energy output settings. Can be used by holograms on humans.
200 CP,Ice Ray,Flash Gordon,"A raygun that encases the target in a block of ice. Very convenient for fighting fires, or taking prisoners as people can somehow always be harmlessly thawed out."
200 CP,Jingwei's Shocksword,Fallout 3,"A unique variant of the swords typically given to Chinese officers. By flicking a switch on the handle, the blade becomes enveloped by a field of electricity. Beyond the obvious use of electrocuting enemies, there is always the chance that you could vaporize your enemies, leaving only a pile of ash in your wake."
200 CP,Laser Gun,Gargoyles ,A laser rifle capable of high and low energy blasts. One shot will kill most people but only severely injure main characters. Never runs out of power.
200 CP,M6 Spartan Las,Halo - UNSC,"Fight fire with fire. Sure, that sounds good when you say it, but then you have to wonder how Humanity can do what when they’re up against aliens with plasma technology. The answer is lasers. Originally meant to be a supplement to MJOLNIR as Project GUNGNIR, it was scaled back due to the ludicrous cost of producing it. The weapon works by painting a red targeting laser on the target, accompanied by a growing, audible whine as the weapon cycled up. So long as it does not charge for three seconds this process can be aborted and save battery, but upon firing a powerful microsecond-long pulse of energy bursts out which is capable of burning through thick plates of metallic laminates or hard steel. Targets within two meters of the strike seem to be damaged and light vehicles suffer damage due to this weapon, so perhaps the cost is worth it."
200 CP,Magnetic Accelerator,Demolition Man,"You might be saying ""this is the future, where are all the phaserguns?"" Well, look no further. The Magnetic Accelerator Gun,the last produced hand held weapon of this millennium, displaces the flow of neutrons through a non-linear cycloidel ectromagnetic accumulator. It comes with a built in laser scope, has 700 rounds on a full charge, a range of 800 meters,and can decimate a fire hydrant in one shot.Its battery can completely recharge itself from empty in a week."
200 CP,Mandalorian Ripper ,Star Wars - KOTOR,Energy powered ballistic pistol. Ignores personal shields and most armor. Can be modified with attachments like a scope or silencer. Shots cannot be completely deflected by a lightsaber. More durable than regular blasters. Highly illegal to own.
200 CP,Marksman,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition.,"The most important aspect of firefights nowadays is how accurate your shots are and how quickly you can move to a new target. Your skill in these areas are legendary, as you can easily hit a target from a kilometer away with most ranged weapons, and can quickly identify and aim towards the next best target after you've taken down your previous target."
200 CP,Particle Magnum ,Stargate Atlantis,"A handgun that fires bolts of energy and is styled remarkably like a revolver, used by the Travelers but sometimes found in the hands of others. The weapon has two selectors, one being the safety and the other deciding the power level: stun, kill and incinerate (explosive). This particular sidearm doesn’t need maintenance or recharging, and can have a different appearance if you like."
200 CP,Plasma Gun ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"Among the best things about being a Squat, reliable plasma guns every bit as potent as the Imperial version that don’t explode. Come in pistol or rifle versions, can be taken multiple times."
200 CP,Power Maul,Warhammer 40K_ Kill Team Chaos Vol 1,"
A blunt weapon encased in a crackling energy field, the power maul is
perfect for dealing concussive damage that can crush armor and pulverize
bones. Its impact delivers a stunning electrical charge, making it ideal for
controlling crowds or disabling heavily armored opponents with a single
blow."
200 CP,Power Sword,Planetary Governor Jump,"A deadly melee weapon with a sharp energy field that can slice through most materials with ease. It hums with energy and can be used to deflect incoming attacks. It is especially effective against armoured foes, and can even slice through certain types of force fields. A skilled user can deliver devastating blows that can easily cut through flesh and bone"
200 CP,Pulse Grenades,Fallout Series,"Everyone can agree that some of the worst things to fight in the Wasteland are robots, seeing as they don’t have any preservation instinct. Well, this purchase should help with those problems, as these twenty grenades discharge an EMP that is especially effective against both robots and those wearing power armor. Like many other items here, these pulse grenades will be replenished daily."
200 CP,Smart Weaponry ,Aliens vs Predator,"Two portable Sentry guns with ammo and computer control hook-ups as well as a harness- mounted Smartgun. All three of these weapons automatically lock on to hostile targets in front of them; the main difference is you carry a smartgun and squeeze the trigger to fire, while the tripod-mounted Sentry guns are computer-controlled. They all use the same 10mm caseless explosive AP round, of which there are several spare cases – but this is a more powerful round than the M41A Pulse Rifle uses."
200 CP,Soultaker,Generic Young Justice Fanfic,"A sword that cuts casually through steel and seals the souls of its victims. You can summon these souls to question them or, with practice, manifest as a ghostly army to fight by your side. You may apply these qualities to any other bladed weapon."
200 CP,The Meltagun ,"Warhammer 40k: Ciaphas Cain, Hero of the Imperium","The Meltagun is a powerful, short range anti-armour weapon that produces an intense, energetic beam of heat in the tens of thousands of degrees Centigrade. It is an incredibly dangerous tool capable of killing powerful foes such as Space Marines and higher level Tyranids."
200 CP,Time Stick ,Loki Jump,"The standard weapon used by the TVA to incapacitate and/or prune Variants. Collapsible and capable of lengthening to a longer bladed staff-like shape, this device can seemingly disintegrate any organic or inorganic target, while actually transporting it to the Void. Yours can be configured to send a target elsewhere if desired. An additional function can briefly slow a target hit by this baton-like weapon to 1/16th of its speed, while causing them to feel the pain in real time. Useful if you need to secure someone with far greater strength than you."
200 CP,Volkite,Warhammer 40 - Black Crusade,"A weapon once used en masse during the Great Crusade, wielding one now would be seen as possessing the favor of the God-Emperor himself. If not for its age, then for its devastating power. Volkite weapons are direct thermal weapons, capable of punching through the ceramite plating of Astartes armor with terrifying ease and still ignite the wearer. Worse, it deflagrates the enemy and ignites anything the target may have been in direct contact with. This weapon will be the bane of all you fight."
200 CP,Xerrol Nightstinger,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"A blaster sniper weapon. For a sniper rifle it doesn’t have the best range, but does have one stunning advantage, that being that it fires an invisible bolt. I’m certain a weapon like this has some use."
300 CP,Fat Man,Fallout: New Vegas,A fat man (possibly named Esther) that never runs out of mini nukes. Just try to keep in mind why this world is in the state it’s in.
300 CP,Melta Bombs ,Imperial Guard Jumpchain,"A melta bomb is a large, magnetic explosive using similar principles as melta guns. These ferociously powerful bombs are known for being capable of breaching spaceship hulls and threatening even the heaviest armour around. Though heavy, unwieldy and not designed to be an anti-infantry weapon, the infernal heat produced by a melta bomb is usually enough to clear crowds of people at once. Every week you get a new one.
"
300 CP,Rod of Covenant,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","Resembling a fancy spear, it is capable of releasing a blast of eldritch energy from its tip that can melt even a Necron in a single blast, and reduce an organic being to nothing but ash. It also generates an energy field that allows it to be used in melee similar to a Power Weapon. A favored weapon of Triarch Praetorians.
"
300 CP,Sonic Screw You,Firefly,"You have a high-tech and complicated sonic weapon. It’s tiny, and easily concealable. When activated, this device can function in two modes; it can fire off a stunning pulse once every few seconds, knocking unprotected humans within 10 feet and 20 degrees unconscious, or it can emit a continuous and lethal infrasonic buzz. This droning sound damages the organs of unprotected listeners (a single pair of high- tech earplugs is included with the weapon) and will cause fatal hemorrhages in all major organs within a few minutes."
300 CP,Vindicta's phaser ,Star Trek - Lower Decks,"This phaser has a dual-mode operation, it can either fire a high-power beam or a Gatling mode. The high-power beam fires out of the central aperture, it is powerful enough that it can cut through a reinforced ship hull in 12 seconds. The Gatling gun mode can quickly cycle beams out of the 4 smaller apertures that can re-tune to a random setting after each discharge, each aperture can also function independently using AI assistance or focused fire on a single target."
300 CP,Vortex Grenades ,Imperium Nihilus ,"If this doesn’t scream dangerous, perhaps you should get your senses checked. Unlike regular grenades, these devices utilize complex and intricate warp technology to function, technology dating back to before the Age of Strife. Upon detonation, these grenades burst open a rift—a vortex, if you will—between real space and the Warp. These rifts often esemble what we know of as a black hole and it acts like one. All things within the rift shall be drawn into the warp, ripped apart until they become part of it and only the mightiest shall be spared of this terrible fate. You do not want to be anywhere near these when they go off.Fittingly enough, owing to the nature of their creation, vortex grenades are astronomically rare. They are manufactured only in small quantities by the Adeptus Mechanicus and found only within the hands of the Imperium’s greatest agents and assets. Use these well and use them wisely."
400 CP,Aeternus,Fallout 4,"The Aeternus is an incredibly efficient Gatling Laser, carried by a rogue knight of the Brotherhood; it never seems to fully deplete its fusion core, giving it functionally unlimited ammo- although, were it to be fired continuously for an indeterminate amount of time, it’s ammunition would be depleted eventually- but during that time, you could pretty much kill anything that’s ever walked."
400 CP,Alien Blaster ,Fallout 3,"A strange weapon from beyond the stars, this silver and blue pistol will fire off azure blasts that seem to act like plasma, but function like lasers. It hits like a super sledge and can pierce through most armors. Even a single shot from this could vaporize a mole rat completely, so what do you think would happen if you shot it at another person?"
400 CP,BFG-9000 ,Doom 2016,"The brainchild of the ARC Facility, the BFG uses supercharged Argent Plasma to make
anything in the general direction of the business end explode in a blast of lightning and gore. Fun!"

400 CP,Cryolator,Fallout Series,"The antithesis to the flamer, this very rare weapon is sure to cool off some hotheads. As it propels super-chilled nitrogen, it freezes your enemies solid and stops them in their tracks. Of course, if you don't want a constant spray, then there is an option to fire off ice pellets. Just as effective as actual bullets, and containing the same freezing effect, but requiring more precision in its use."
400 CP,Phaser Bazooka,Star Trek - Lower Decks,This high power Phaser is a copy of the personal artillery owned by Lieutenant Shaxs which he constructed from a downed shuttlepod’s phaser emitter. This weapon can be fired in short bursts or have the trigger held down to charge a blast strong enough to bring down lightly armoured starships.
400 CP,Super Sledge ,Fallout Series,"This type of sledgehammer was created with the return of trench warfare, necessitating the creation of a tool superior to regular large hammers for engineering work and breaching concrete fortifications. It stores kinetic energy in order to increase the force of impact, making anyone hit by this baby have a very bad day. It's not unheard of to install small rockets to the back of the head in order to further increase its power."
400 CP,Tesla Rifle,Fallout 4,"The Tesla Rifle is another Rust Devil special, cobbled together from robot parts. It fires bolts of electricity that arc between targets, making it great for crowd control; in addition, it’s capable of being modified in a number of ways, allowing you to change how the gun fires."
400 CP,Warscythe,Warhammer 40K - Mechanicus,"Not only is the Warscythe another fractal edged blade capable of slicing through any known material, this vertically-aligned blade has heavier mass and produces an entropic energy field, causing it to inflict more damage apart from the perfect cut. Furthermore, a side effect of the entropic energy field has turned the Warscythe itself effectively indestructible, requiring the absolute extremes of force to so much as scratch it."
400 CP,The Blade of Admonition,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k Jumpchain,The Blade of Admonition is the sword wielded by Alicia Dominica. This blade was used to cut off Goge Vandire’s head. Anyone who gazes into the blade will see a reflection of their own soul. Against the blade's enemies this can paralyze them granting its wielder opportunities to slay their foes. Its wielders however are inspired by the spirit of Alicia Dominica and will carry the grace of the Emperor himself into battle.
600 CP,Tachyon Arrow,Warhammer 40K - Mechanicus,"A wrist-mounted energy weapon, it transmutes a sliver of inert metal into an
unstoppable thunderbolt that can pierce through a mountain."
