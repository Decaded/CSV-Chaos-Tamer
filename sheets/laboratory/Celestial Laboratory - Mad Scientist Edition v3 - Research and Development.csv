0 CP,Lab Safety Equipment ,Batman - The Animated Series,"Labcoat, gloves, glasses. While simple, these things seem to shield from accidents in the lab much better than normal safety gear; while they don’t prevent accidents from happening, the accidents that
do happen will damage you far less when you’re wearing these things."
0 CP,Holotape Recorder,Fallout Series ,"Holotapes are laser-readable media storage devices, capable of storing all kinds of information safely for extended periods of time, ranging from music to movies to diary entries, to more. How lucky you are, as you've now got an entire set up just for recording these holotapes, as well as being able to transfer them into other forms of media storage, or vice versa."
100 CP,Portal Plans ,Earth Final Conflict,"Starting in season two, the Taelons start integrating interdimensional standing portals into major airports around earth. Each transit is instantaneous from the perspective of the user, but in objective time takes ten minutes. On the other hand, that’s a flat travel time and these things can reach distant galaxies, though they still need a receiving station. You have a complete set of schematics, including a version that folds up into a two-foot canister for rapid deployment in the field."
100 CP,Lab Coat ,Fallout 3,"You can't exactly be a scientist without looking the part! This pristine lab coat will give you a scholarly aura, making you seem smarter than you actually are. It certainly helps that it never seems to get caught on anything, either."
100 CP,Bookshelf ,Fallout 3,"Knowledge is power, and much has been lost since the bombs fell. Luckily, you have the next best thing. Books. Yes, this bookshelf is filled with all kinds of books that will noticeably increase related skills. There are books on general science, public speaking, car maintenance, unarmed combat, gun manuals, and even more."
100 CP,Skill Books,Fallout Series ,"Knowledge is power, which is very unfortunate considering how few institutions of learning are still functioning. Luckily, you have the next best thing. Books. Yes, this bookshelf is filled with all kinds of books that will noticeably increase related skills. There are books on general science, public speaking, car maintenance, unarmed combat, gun manuals, and even more."
100 CP,Nitrimine ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"The formula for the chemical compound known as Nitramene, this compound has multiple purposes. A typical Nitramene bomb has a blast radius of five hundred yards after which it creates a vacuum that causes an implosion as matter rushes to fill the void that it has created, but a grenade of that size will do considerably less damage. On the other hand, Nitramene also emits low levels of Vita Radiation, which has a specific wavelength that has stabilizing properties.
"
100 CP,Research & Development Center ,Mass Effect - Andromeda,"The R&D center is integral to the Initiative’s colonization efforts in the Heleus cluster. There is one in every settlement. As you increase the amount of information you discover, the more you will be able to progress and discover in the Research section. And Development allows a user to build any object that you have the blueprints/plans for and resources to make it. If you have a ship, you can choose to integrate this into the ship. While the R&D center is initially limited to making things that are man portable, with the appropriate upgrades, that may change. After all, Remnant Vaults have such interesting technology..."
100 CP,Data Banks,Red Dwarf,You possess a large amount of knowledge across numerous different fields. You can often pull a helpful fact or two in a situation. Repeat purchases give either some very obscure knowledge or more in-depth of the range you already know with this perk.
100 CP,Alien Containment,XCOM - Enemy Unknown,"A cell for alien interrogations, able to resist a dizzying array of weapons and powers. After the war, who knows? Perhaps you’ll someday have a use for an escape-proof cell."
1000 CP,Halo,Halo - The Forerunner Saga,"You should know what this is. Halo. The ultimate, final, weapon of the Forerunners. Devised by the brilliant but twisted mind of Faber, the Master Builder, this ten thousand kilometer wide ring world releases a powerful burst of cross-phased supermassive neutrinos that are capable of destroying all life in an entire star system. Properly tuned and powered, they could do more than that: they could kill all neurologically complex life in 25,000 light years around them. Not even the neuro-physical structures left by the Precursors are spared. Due to the nature of the energy released, which ignores space and time, the pulse sweeps through their target region near instantly. Halo isn’t just a sledgehammer weapon though. It can be wielded with precision: Its pulse can be concentrated into a beam to avoid uninvolved casualties. Its energy can be tuned to target specific species as well. What this weapon has in power, though, it lacks in defense. Four forerunner cruisers could destroy one of these rings together in one shot. Alternatively you could use this ring in the way the Librarian had hoped: As a habitat and research center for lifeforms. A safe haven."
1000 CP,Reaper Tech Data Core ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Over the eons, the Reapers continued their Cycles, cataloging and preserving each and every civilization they found in their unique way. What you have here is impossibly rare, and completely invaluable. This terminal contains the sum total knowledge of everything the Reapers have ever encountered. In depth notes of different biologies, ranging from the races of the mighty Leviathan to the lowly Vorcha, and all of the Flora and Fauna on each planet that has ever developed.

All the different societies that have been developed and their relative success. Full records of their histories, mythologies, and linguistics. All the music, plays, shows and media created. Even all the culinary recipes developed. This contains everything. There is so much in here that it would take even a modern AI a few decades to go through everything stored within."
1000 CP,Kryptonian Database ,Superman - Red Son,"How? How did you get this? You’ve somehow gotten your hands on the entire database of Krypton. All their scientific knowledge, philosophy, music, and history. Everything. With the right intellect and time, you can in time understand all of this and propel mankind to whole new heights, or just keep it to yourself, who are you to decide mankind’s future?"
200 CP,Laboratory,DC - The Fourth World,"A common thread between both sides of the New Gods is that their proximity to the Source makes them above and beyond the common technologies of the multiverse – a lone Mother Box alone could evolve common Earth technology light years ahead of what they have now. With knowledge being so powerful, it’s only fair you have a workshop to put it to good use. Containing every mundane metal, material, and chemical within this multiverse – nothing with blatantly supernatural, metaphysical, or magical components – this is a science lab with top-of-the-line equipment, able to put the dens of so-called supergeniuses of Earth and beyond to absolute shame. Scanners, work tables, even a medical bay for healing...or dissection. It will include similar mundane stocks of material in future jumps, updating for each universe you enter, though any ‘special’ components will still need to be acquired elsewhere."
200 CP,Secret Lab,Invincible,"You have a full kitted out secret lab, hidden in a warehouse of your choice. You own this warehouse outright, and for some reason it continuously gets utilities without you ever paying. The most important
things that this warehouse comes with is a fantastic high tech lab and refilling resources. It comes equipped to be fully utilizable by a super-genius to make high tech objects. It has refilling resources sufficient to make and maintain about a dozen drones or suits of armour on par with Robot Rex’s. This warehouse can be added into any new jump or world that you travel to and retains all upgrades."
200 CP,Cryo Chamber,Lexx,"This is a cryogenic chamber capable of waking its occupant either manually from the outside or on a timer. It contains its own power supply, which can last indefinitely, and will not suffer malfunctions unless deliberately sabotaged. Any and all negative effects are suspended while the occupant is in stasis. Aging is halted, diseases do not progress, curses don’t worsen, protoblood doesn’t break down. All such effects resume once the occupant comes out of stasis."
200 CP,Thorian Enthrallment Notes,Mass Effect,"Also known as ""Species 37"". An over 50,000 year old sentient plant. Details all known information on how it controls people with spores and telepathy. Includes the notes on how Saren Arterius will breed controlled krogan. Could be used to reverse-engineer the same methods with sufficient testing. Could make something like extremely effective calming medicine, group combat stimulators that synchronize normal people into an effective fighting unit, various pain and pleasure inducing agents respectively which can be used in conjunction for mind control, mutagenic agents, and more."
200 CP,Research Assistants ,Mass Effect - Andromeda,"A true scientist will realize that when they are reaching for the stars, that they are standing on the shoulders of the giants who came before them. So sometimes, it’s nice to not have to stand alone. You have a group of  cientists helping you out. While you are in the field, others will be checking your work and conclusions, cleaning up miscellaneous details, and getting the word out there about who exactly is trailblazing. And sometimes, the folks back in the lab will catch sometime you missed. Maybe they spotted a rune you needed, or saw something reflective off in the distance. No matter what,every so often, your science helpers will help you make progress on your current science goals. And in between those bursts of helpfulness, they also handle a lot of the grunt work of science for you."
200 CP,Republic Vehicle Blueprints,Star Wars - Clone Wars,"A list of ships, mechs and armored vehicles either currently or planned to be produced for the Galactic Republic such as the AT-RT, the LAAT gunship, the ARC-170 starfighter, and even the Venator-class Star Destroyer.

200 CP,Separatist Droid Blueprints ,Star Wars - Clone Wars,"A list of mechanical infantry units planned to be produced for the CIS. This list includes every droid they plan to field, from the common B1 and vulture droids to the ultra rare MagnaGuards."
200 CP,Star Maps,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"Imprecise warp travel is incredibly dangerous to attempt without proper coordinates. This is one of the reasons that proper star maps are so valuable and safeguarded. This is a complete star map of the entire galaxy and all known regions of space within the jump. Should you venture out of the galaxy this map will catalog the details of the regions you discover. For example the calmest routes, planets, and any important locations that you find will be noted down
"
200 CP,Legio Cybernetica database,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"A trove of information that elder magi would be jealous of, this cogitator core contains the STC blueprints needed to construct all patterns of Battle-Automata and their standard weapon loadouts. The core also contains detailed instructions on how to produce and program the doctrina wafers that dictate each automata's behavior. Though not sapient, automata display animalistic levels of intelligence and devotion, and after long periods of operation may develop harmless behavioral quirks."
200 CP,Primordial Schematics,Warhammer 40k - Necrons,"The human world of Cadia was able to stymie the advance of Chaos largely due to the efforts of Necron technology. The mysterious pylons of Cadia acted to reinforce the materium even on the verge of the Eye of Terror. During the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the Archmagos Belisarius Cawl was even able to use them to shrink the largest Warp Storm in the galaxy. The designs behind this priceless technology are now within your possession. Outside of this setting, pylons designed according to the specifications of these schematics will disrupt interdimensional portals and incursions with some fine-tuning."
200 CP,Technical Schematics,Warhammer 40k - Tau,"This small database is a well organized, easily searchable, and easily accessible list of detailed schematics and scientific texts covering all machines, tools, and sciences understood by the T’au. It cannot be remotely hacked or externally corrupted by others. During your jump, this database includes all T’au knowledge up to either current 40k canon or all information that would be available to the T’au within the next hundred years without your interference, whichever option includes less advanced technology. After this jump, the schematics are upgraded to include all designs and science your T’au have developed and all designs and science developed in canon by the T’au by the end of the Fifth Sphere Expansion."
200 CP,Liber Heresius,Warhammer 40k: Imperium of Man,"An artifact tome first laid down during the Age of Apostasy that has grown to contain the wisdom of thousands of Ordo Hereticus Inquisitors. By properly interrogating its pages, the reader can gain wisdom that enables them to predict and counter the strategies of renegades and traitors before their schemes come to fruition. Over the centuries, the Liber Heresius has become incredibly unwieldy, as
each new wielder scribbles his own notes into its margins."
200 CP,Sukebe Blueprints,Pokegirls,"You have a thumb drive filled with a bunch of Blueprints for a decent amount of Sukebe’s technology,
everything from pokeballs to genetic modification devices."
300 CP,Jumper Computer,Batman - The Animated Series,"A state of the art supercomputer on par with the Batcomputer, which Batman utilizes in most of his detective work.

300 CP,RobCo Holotapes,Fallout 4,"A series of Holotapes detailing the blueprints for numerous Robco projects, including Protectrons, Assaultrons, Securitrons, and the various models of Pip-Boys. There’s even a group of Holotapes detailing Liberty Prime’s systems and construction. These Holotapes seem to be more advanced than the standard kind, and therefore there are only a few rather than the hundreds this amount of information would normally take up. "
300 CP,Corbetite Vaults ,Girl Genius,"Ooh. This... well, this should be interesting for you, in the Chinese manner of speaking. You
have somehow, it seems, come into the possession of a huge, labyrinthine set of underground
tunnels, passages and caverns, which holds a set of Vaults apparently lost by the Corbetite
monks sometime in the past. This is a huge, eclectic collection of rogue experiments, borderline berserk clanks, lost research papers, powerful weapons, silly experiments, and everything in between. With hundreds of vaults inside and each of them holding several objects, there are items from some of the most famous (or infamous) figures from Europan history, a collection of objects that would give several people nightmares. Possibly including you. Since you’re paying CP you can be assured that each and everything in here will end up being useful and nifty somehow, but there’s no telling how or when it might happen. This is the kind of place where you find Trains that hate tracks and schedules, random Dreen chilling out, and the odd zombified king now and then."
300 CP,Cold Station 12 ,Star Trek - Enterprise,"A space station containing the preserved embryos of 1800 Augments, plus samples of every disease and pathogen known to Starfleet or the Denobulans at this time. Also comes with computer records of all these diseases, their cures and vaccines if any, and every tweak Arik Soong ever made to the human genome."

a single War Droid.
"
300 CP,"STC converter",Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"This tome-sized cogitator is designed to be fed blueprints for alien or out-of-jump technology and convert them to use STC-standard parts and design principles, well-known for being extremely robust. Perfect translation and equal functionality is not guaranteed, while technology that relies on unique materials or scientific principles not native to the 40k setting will most likely be impossible to recreate. The blueprints that result from successful conversions can be followed by any competent tech-priest. Running blueprints for Magitech or psionic technology through this device without a supreme understanding of 40k metaphysics is an exceedingly bad idea."
300 CP,Blue Sky on Mars ,Total Recall,"This is a massive mountain-sized aero-forming machine. Once per jump (or once per century), you may install it on any planet. When activated, it will transform the atmosphere of that planet into something suitable for whatever form of life you are when you activate it. This doesn’t instantly turn it into a viable human world (the gravity might be too light or to high, the seas could be acid or magma, there could be Orks, etc.) but the air will be at the right pressure and humidity, and fully breathable. As long as it is installed, the machine will continue to maintain the atmosphere, but such an atmosphere can become self-sustaining if there aren’t forces acting to contaminate or strip it."
400 CP,D’lex Formula ,Aliens vs Predator,"A semi-crystalline metal alloy used extensively by the Yautja in everything from their armor, to weapons, to their starships and buildings. It’s incredibly strong, light and resistant to heat and acid. Weapons made from d’lex hold their edge under punishment that would shatter a blade of normal metal. This formula allows you to create D’lex metal from ordinary elements."
400 CP,Moon Laboratory ,All-Star Superman,"Because why settle for a normal laboratory? While not necessarily needing to be on the moon (it can be in a mountain, underwater, or hidden in some other habitat you have access to), this is a fully-stocked laboratory for any sort of scientific discipline available to modern minds in this world. Though currently lacking in staff, it comes with a teleporter that can instantly teleport you to the lab from anywhere within the local solar system and back with a simple command. It also has a restocking warehouse of various common materials for constructing new devices or engineering marvels you wish to make."
400 CP,Laboratory,Batman - The Animated Series,"A large research center with millions of dollars’ worth of equipment, oriented towards any number of scientific pursuits. In addition to the equipment you also get a team of researchers, thinkers, and other scientifically minded folk that can you with your work for you to direct."
400 CP,JUMP Labs,DCEU Jump,"A private think tank of your own. You own an equivalent research organisation to the famed STAR
labs, the organisation usually entrusted with reverse engineering all kinds of alien technology.
Hundreds of the most gifted scientists from across the world work here, studying the research
materials and projects that you direct them to. They’re quite loyal too, unwilling to betray you or the
organisation even for a lot of money or their own lives. Sadly, any other employees apart from the
scientists aren’t guaranteed to be so loyal, so keep an eye out on those high powered weapon
projects. You’ve already got a few contracts set up with the local government to have some capital
come to the organisation but you’ll need to have them keep giving results if you want the group to
grow more. You’ll be the head of a similar organisation in all future worlds."
400 CP,Data Core ,Earth Final Conflict,"A crystal containing a complete database of Taelon technology as of the start of the series (no Forge or later superweapon projects). Interactive and extremely user-friendly. Millions of years more advanced than Earth tech, though, and far in advance of Jaridian."
400 CP,Vault-Tec Database,Fallout 3,"There are so many fantastical things to be found here that wouldn't be out of place in a midnight science fiction feature! Robots, laser weaponry, advanced medicines, deadly viruses, space age alloys, cybernetic implants, and so much more. This terminal contains schematics for all American technology developed up until the Great War. From everyday household appliances to advanced energy weapons to a GECK, there's little you couldn't create with this."
400 CP,Palpatine’s Blueprints,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction ,"Sheev may have been suicidally overconfident, but the man sure did have nice toys. Here you have what looks to be a holocron, which will only respond to you or those you authorize, even if you are not a Force user. Those looking for secrets of cosmic power will be disappointed, since instead of being filled with secrets of the Force, it’s filled with blueprints and schematics. From both Death Stars, to Shadow Droids, to World Devastators, to the Galaxy Gun, every one of the Emperor’s secret weapons have their designs stored here. It even contains blueprints for devices based on his designs, like the Darksaber."
400 CP,Worthy Workshop ,Girl Genius,"The tradesman needs the right tools, don’t you know? More than that, they need the labs! You
have a full set of labs, for chemical, biological, mechanical experiments, as well as any other
kinds you might need. Abominable, perhaps? These are some of the most elaborate, extensive laboratories and workshops in the world, with vast arrays of instruments and tools of the finest make, an unlimited supply of test subjects, and huge amounts of spare parts, reagents, books and journals... everything a spark needs to get going. You have just about any and all parts and reagents you might need, even things incredibly rare like water from the Dyne, and the absolute latest in all parts, of course.
Furthermore, any and all properties you have that can support them all develop similar labs and
workshops, providing you a virtually unlimited collection of spaces to work from so you’re never,
ever left unable to tinker to your heart’s content."

What you have here is data of all technology created in this Cycle, as well as containing an in-depth summary of all the different lifeforms found here. Both flora and fauna, and all the sentient races found amongst the stars."
400 CP,Necromonger Technology,Riddick,"During your time with the Necromongers you manged to gleam the basics of their technology. This wont allow you to create the apex of their designs such as the Conquest Icons that the Necromongers use to kill worlds. But most other things are open to you, such as the gravity weapons, long distance communication networks and the inner workings of the fighters and other smaller ships. You still cannot fix the ship you crashed with however as it is little more than a pile of scrap metal."
400 CP,Notes of Belia Darzu,Star Wars - Darth Bane,"It seems there’s no need for you to brave the deep core to reach Tython, for you already have
extensive notes detailing the work of the Dark Lord Belia Darzu - a master of the Sith Force technique of mechu-deru. This technique allows its practitioners to exert their influence over inanimate and robotic constructs. Through mechu-deru, mechanical structures could be bound to the will of the user and imbued with the power of the Force itself. Belia Darzu took it to an extreme in her creation of Technobeasts, Part machine, part organic alchemical constructs, these monsters infect living organisms with the nanogene spore, a technovirus that slowly lobotomises victims as they transition into loyal weaponised cyborgs. All of Darzu’s workings are detailed in these notes; with extensive study you may produce plagues beyond even her galaxy shaking abomination."
400 CP,Imperial Designs,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"The Galactic Empire for all of its flaws does not lack technologically in the slightest. Stored on a datacube is a vast number of designs and knowledge that makes up everything the Empire has managed to achieve, and whatever other technologies its gained from others. This ranges from things as simple Duplicators of Food Replicators to the advanced technologies used in the Death Star and other contemporary superweapons."
400 CP,Wraith Data Device,Stargate Atlantis,"A Wraith data storage device, with an adaptor for human computers. It contains everything you ever wanted to know about Wraith technology but were too afraid to ask. The sheer volume of data deals more with theory rather than engineering practice (eg: you might find the technical explanation on how the Wraith beaming tech works, but not the schematics to build one straight away)
"
400 CP,Biotransference Protocols​,Warhammer 40k - Necrons,"Behold, the designs that were meant to secure the salvation of the Necrontyr, and instead cost them their souls. These schematics contain two things of note: the first is the Necrodermis shells of the Necrons and their constructs, from the lowliest Warriors and Scarabs to the greatest Tomb Sentinels. Secondly, they teach the method of biotransference itself, transitioning an organic mind into a body of metal. Will you use these designs to create a robotic army to put the Men of Iron to shame? Or will you use them to secure immortality?"
400 CP,Library Sanctus ,Warhammer 40K - Talons of the Emperor," The Library Sanctus is a repository of knowledge, and unlike nearly all others in the Imperium, it is completely uncensored. Within its halls you can find tomes and cogitators on myriad subjects. Upon matters of Xenos biology, culture, and technology, upon chaos, upon archeotech- here you can find references and honest information on them all. While many things are fragmentary, due to Humanity simply not ever having or managing to fully recover the knowledge, it is all accurately written, and a sufficiently clever person could piece most things together given enough time. There are a great many who would kill to have access to this hidden library- and just as many who have to make sure none do. Use its knowledge well. You will find blueprints for any item your purchase within its halls, though xenos or archeotech beyond your faction’s knowledge base will be scattered and fragmented, requiring a not inconsiderable amount of research to piece together."
400 CP,Shaping Center ,Warhammer 40k - Tau,"This compound is half ranch, half chemistry lab. It comes staffed with NPC scientists and ranchers who can breed, grow, and train the various Kroot subspecies that are used in combat, such as Kroot hounds and even the mighty Greater Knarloc. Any animal grown in the center will be perfectly trained and loyal to you and those you designate as their masters. Moreover, similar genetic research and breeding projects on non-kroot species undertaken in the center will be more successful and faster than they should be."
400 CP,Sentinel Plans ,X-Men Evolution,"How on earth did you get these? The prototype isn’t meant to finished until almost a year passes. Regardless these are Bolivar Task’s plans to even out the mutant playing field with a mass producible robot. The sentinel as it is called is capable of many things ranging from firing lasers, flight to the atmosphere, and has a gel substance which will trap most mutants. It seems like there are even plans for something called a Super Sentinel but current technology make its almost impossible to complete. Maybe you’ll be the first to bring it in then."
400 CP,Professor T.O. Morrow’s Notes,Young Justice,"These notes detail the creation of the “Red” series of androids, including Red Torpedo, Red Inferno, Red Tornado, and Red Volcano, as well as designs for androids that resemble actual people."
400 CP,Sacred Texts,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"This collection is a comprehensive library of Jedi tomes, containing the entire history of the Jedi Order’s philosophies and training regimens. Armed with such texts, you could master the ancient practices even without a teacher. As a unique property, those you instruct using this book can gain a youngling-level Force Sensitivity. For further growth, they must work hard and train constantly, though with your help the process may be expedited."
400 CP ,The Wayfinder,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Recovering the legacy of an order that has been destroyed, and lost, and deliberately suppressed is no simple task. All the commonly known sources of Jedi lore were plundered by the Empire long ago, and either destroyed or taken to one of Palpatine’s hidden caches. Fortunately, you have this fancy compass. This doesn’t point to one point, but rather to the next step in finding the nearest source of Jedi lore. In future jumps this will instead point the way toward caches of lost or forgotten lore or artifacts. Once you’ve found a location using this device, you can re-attune it to lead you back with a moment of effort."
600 CP,Building Better Worlds ,Aliens vs Predator,"It seems you’ve got a lot of proprietary secrets packed away in that skull of yours; Weyland- Yutani has its fingers in many pies, after all. All of that proprietary technology is resting at your  fingertips: Atmospheric Processing Stations that can turn a barren, unbreathable moon into a world that humans can survive and thrive on. Starship drives that can punch through the speed of light to deliver passengers and cargo from distant worlds in a fraction of the time speed of light transports would take. Androids that are indistinguishable, in appearance and behaviour to humans, yet superior in almost every way. And lastly, genetic experimentation data collected from across inhabited space; enough to get you started should you need to modify a certain newly-discovered breed. All this and more are the tools at your command. Build a better world."
600 CP,The Maw Installation ,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction ,"Congratulations Jumper you’re now the proud owner of a secret research facility in the middle of a cluster of black holes! Beyond being almost unreachable and undetectable due to its location, and therefore one of the most secure locations in the galaxy, this large facility is one of the most advanced in the galaxy and contains everything a Galactic Empire with a virtually bottomless check book could give it. This includes quarters, labs, food production, etc. It is also staffed by a number of loyal follower characters who fulfill various roles in the station ranging from researchers to security. While the researchers will be of higher quality than most, only a few can be expected to match the likes of Qwi Xux and those of her level, though even that’s enough to reproduce things like the Sun Crusher and Death Star."
600 CP,The Black Library ,Generic Warhammer 40k ,"The most obscure corner of the webway and perhaps the greatest source of knowledge within the 40K universe. It contains all of the Eldar vast knowledge including the forbidden knowledge of Chaos. Normally the library itself would protect against anyone who hasn’t tempered the chaos within themselves, but by purchasing it you gain complete access. Be warned much of this knowledge is forbidden for a reason. In addition this library will come with a Harlequin troupe who will serve the master of the library or in this case you. This group will be led by a Solitaire. Should any of them die they will be reborn within the library
"
600 CP,Laboratory,Halo - The Covenant,"Most Huragok have to work in terrible conditions. Either it's constantly on the loud engine, or it's right beneath the most crowded areas in the ship. And let's not forget that your supervisors see you as equipment, not needing such luxuries as personal space, or leisure activities. But not you, for you have the perfect place to work. Completely silent, comes with all the equipment and specimens you need, and of course, it's attached to your warehouse. Comes equipped with a powerful forerunner supercomputer, to test your designs in a simulation that is guaranteed to be accurate, and a few spare, non-sentient Huragok imitators that will carry out your orders as well as droids."
600 CP,Luminary,Halo - The Covenant,"This is a relic most holy indeed- a map to other Forerunner relics throughout your region of the Galaxy. As you consult this relic, it will tell you of the relics nearest you and their nature. These forerunner installations may have extremely capable guardians, be they the automatons of your gods themselves or simply humans, unaware of the divine power beneath their filthy feet. Post-jump, this device shall unfailingly send you to the relics, weapons, and sites of those races that can be considered ancient and unknowably powerful."
600 CP,Gene-Tech Vault,Horus Hersey ,"This vault is the birthplace of the Primarchs in ages past. Its door may only be opened by the psychic signature of the Emperor (or yourself, and potentially anyone who can accurately mimic the Emperor’s psychic signature though of course it gives no indication that is what is required). Though the original incubation chambers are cracked and broken, it contains records of the genetics of every Primarch. From this knowledge you could, in time and with study, recreate the creation of the Primarchs, the Custodes and the Astartes from the genetic legacy kept within. You could even use this knowledge to create some kind of gene-seed production line to mass-produce Astartes, or potentially perhaps even begin vat-growing legionaries en-masse."
600 CP,Full Viltrumite Database,Invincible,"You gain a full Viltrumite Empire database that adapts to be readable on any computer or similar device. Contained in this database is a copy of every piece of information ever developed by the Viltrumites or any of their slave races.

This includes space tech, medical knowledge, history, and even the most classified of military secrets. It even holds the knowledge of how to make tailored super-plagues of killing off specific species  with zero chance of mutation or the plague affecting an undesired species, in addition to the creation of lesser diseases."
600 CP,CADMUS Lab ,Justice League: Unlimited ,"An advanced underground research and development facility filled with high quality equipment for biological research and a cloning lab that can produce both creatures and humanoids. This facility also comes with DNA samples and cloning data for Galatae, the Ultimen, and Doomsday. However while you may be able to produce these individuals fairly easily you’ll need to make sure you have some means of controlling or conditioning them once they’ve matured. Finally there is a digital archive stored in one of the computers here that contains detailed simulations of conflicts between the U.S government and the Justice League, and while most of them result in the whole world being destroyed there a few simulations that result in a government victory, albeit with ""acceptable"" casualties. Clones you create with this facility will not possess the mental link drawback that Galatea had with Supergirl. They will also be completely stable and not experience biological decay unless you program them to."
600 CP,Guide to Super Tech Theory ,Justice League: Unlimited ,"This is some seriously dangerous stuff you're holding on to. These innocent looking books contain detailed information on the final project of the brilliant Professor Ivo, they explain a new type of nanotechnology that seems to combine several different branches of engineering, biology, and various other scientific fields in a way that should be impossible! With some extensive study you can figure out how to replicate this nanotech and create equipment capable of emulating supernatural powers from any source, be it magical, scientific, alien, anything! This science isn't exactly perfect however as you'll have to figure out the power in question before you can copy it, and that’s not taking into account how to implement such a power, but that’s is just the natural progression of super science. If you study hard enough you’ll eventually be able to recreate Ivo’s ultimate achievement, the ever evolving android know as AMAZO, an artificial being capable of instantly replicating the skills, abilities, equipment, and other properties of any living being it scans."
600 CP,Technical Knowledge,Lexx,"All of the scientific and technological knowledge ever possessed by the Divine Order and the League of 20,000 Planets has been safely uploaded into your mind. This information is thoroughly indexed and cross referenced, such that you can always recall the specific piece of information you are looking for instantaneously. Given appropriate tools and resources, you could recreate any of the technology here, up to and including building your own Lexx."
600 CP,Prothean Archive,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"All modern technology was derived from what was left by the Protheans, as such any Prothean artifacts are highly sought after for a number of reasons, ranging from the scientific to the religious. What you have here is the pinnacle
of Prothean artifacts, as this archive contains the sum total of all knowledge from the Prothean's Cycle. An in depth history of each race under their control, every story they've written, each weapon they've ever designed, and everything in between. I would be very careful who you tell about this."
600 CP,Omega Particle Research ,Star Trek - Voyager,"You need to be very careful with this, Jumper. The Omega Particle is a highly unstable molecule hazardous to relativistic space travel and considered so dangerous that Starfleet will disregard even the much-vaunted Prime Directive to destroy Omega wherever it is found. The explosion of a single particle can nullify subspace for light years around it, rendering faster-than-light travel impossible within that area. The Borg refer to it as ‘Particle 010’, and despite losing a large quantity of their vessels to accidents trying to harness it, they are expected to assimilate it at all costs. This might make the Borg a nigh-unstoppable force. You...have viable research that could allow you to figure out how to stabilize it and use it as a potent source of energy in a way that won’t backfire. Or you could weaponize it and doing so to Omega particles this research allows you to eventually produce will have similar ‘stop faster-than-light-travel’ properties in other Jumps. Bear in mind this would affect everything in the area of detonation, including you unless you can come up with some specific protection."
600 CP,Caretaker Array Information,Star Trek - Voyager,"Turns out that vast quantity of scanning the Voyager crew did when they showed up in the Caretaker’s facility actually accomplished something. Though the original ends up getting destroyed, the data here is a good start to being able to build a facility capable of moving ships across an entire galaxy, whether they want to or not. It has a powerful tetryon reactor capable of acting as an energy source for an entire city on a nearby planet, contains medical and holographic facilities, is armed with energy weapons, and has a self-destruct system that won’t malfunction unless you want it to. Useful if you want to stop it falling into the wrong hands. It’s going to take a lot of time and resources to understand and build something like this, though."
600 CP,Strange Datacube,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Well what do we have here? Something the rebels would undoubtedly kill to get their hands on. Taking the shape of a small datacube, this device holds the schematics for all of the technologies used by the Galactic Empire and the Resurgent Dark Empire. This contains every superweapon, warship, droid, etc built by both Empires during their respective lifetimes, even if their use was limited, such as in the case of the Dark Troopers. Imagine what you could do if you plugged this into a World Devastator?

600 CP,The Heart ,Star Wars – Darth Plagueis,"Love. It is not a world customarily used by the Sith, but no word could better describe your unconditional attachment to this place and what it represents for your past and future both. This is an immense laboratory complex, filled with countless biological specimens in various stages of vivisection. To the naked eye their appears little similarity to these species, but should one reach out with the Force, they would realise that all share an unusual relationship with it. Some boast a resistance to its influence, able to deny the Force in an area around them, others can use it in ways not yet possible for the Sith and some are just sapient beings with a strong connection to it that you sought to study to better understand yourself. There are many experiments being conducted in this place, by loyal and secure droids, that would serve any alchemist among the Sith well and you’ll find any such experiments you oversee will produce a wealth of useful data and insights into the relationship between biological life and the Force. A few years spent in
these halls could give rise to all manner of abominations, viable clone life and Force powers over life that could have alluded you for a lifetime without the facility. In future worlds they specimens may be changed or expanded to allow for you to better study similarly abnormal lifeforms appropriate to those worlds, with their own unique relationships to seemingly supernatural phenomena and principles."
600 CP,Jedi Archives ,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"This is the Jedi Order's repository of knowledge with its data stored electronically and holographically, holding information on every society and planet in the galaxy including full maps. This database initially contains every society's view of the force and the basics of how they use it.
"
600 CP,Pre-Fall Science,Warhammer 40k - Commorragh,"
You gain an understanding into the theory and practical applications of some of Commorragh's
shiniest bits. Dark matter, anti-grav, cloning, the works man. If it needs psychic then you won’t find it
here dude. Also this shit is really complex, like seriously bro, even for you it’s tough but it will pay
some massive dividends if you put the time in."
600 CP,Laboratory,Warhammer 40k - Minor Xenos,"This minor laboratory is perfectly set up to study psi-tech, both physical and biological, in a safe and consistent manner, is shielded from external supernatural phenomenon both natural and artificial, and cannot be broken into, damaged, or stolen from by any malicious power, regardless of their intelligence or power. It contains heavily encrypted notes, decrypting them would take the most brilliant mortal minds centuries of uninterrupted, dedicated effort, and the psychic protections mean that such a task cannot be brute forced, automated, or bypassed with precognition. Decryption must be performed manually by a sapient mind. However, the notes themselves are intriguing, some bear illustrations of bipedal silhouettes with pointed ears, some slender and some muscular, some with gaping maws and spiked tails, and one in particular bears a white arch."
600 CP,Gene-Lab,Warhammer 40K - Talons of the Emperor,"The Imperium’s greatest strength does not lie in war machines, despite their vast power- it lies within Humanity itself. And this Lab will help you make Humanity greater still. These labs are guaranteed to produce genetic sequences and abilities without error, so long as they are properly sequenced and used upon a proper recipient, though it can be applied at any time in their lives. Even when used upon adults. This is something beyond even the personal gene-labs of the Emperor Himself. It also houses the extensive equipment needed to create new sequences and reverse engineer sequences from samples, though it will require a highly skilled user for highly advanced sequences. If you load in an improper sequence it simply won’t work- this lab has a zero percent rate of failure and an equal mortality rate in procedures. It has twenty one tubes, each of which can hold a single individual.

It comes with two preloaded sequences- that of blanks, which the Imperium has never managed to successfully bring about with gene-craft, and that of Custodians. Simply shove someone into the proper station and they’ll walk out a veritable super human within a week. The lab can do the work itself once it has the proper information stored within in it, though skilled supervision can speed up even it’s unreal pace.

You may also use your gene-lab to grow subjects from the ground up, should you desire it. A truly, spectacularly, ridiculously overpowered Gellar field is built into the lab’s center. It is inscribed with two words: NUNQUAM ITERUM. The field covers the entirety of the lab, and is guarenteed to never fail. Even should every god and daemon to ever exsist join forces in an attempt to breach it, it will hold."
600 CP,Research Laboratory,Warhammer 40k - Tau,"This Research Laboratory is of similar size to the Custom Factory, and includes all of the most advanced mundane technologies of the T’au, with small sections being dedicated to various subfields in Physics, Materials Science, Chemistry, Biology, Engineering, and Computer Science, while still being modular in design and easily upgradeable or repurposed to various other fields. It will manage itself and churn out research into various mundane technologies on its own, though you can direct it to specific purposes, and will manage its own staffing, though you can hire or fire staff as you please (within limits, don’t expect to hire an entire sept to work for this lab). But moreover, this laboratory has some unique properties. Firstly, no research you perform will result in catastrophic destruction, by accident or by sabotage. No nanobots you research here will result in a Grey Goo scenario, no virus will mutate into a global pandemic, no dinosaurs will be unleashed on the public as a staffer flees with their DNA. If such research would normally result in such an issue, your staff will find that their research just stalls, failing to progress at all but not resulting in harm. And secondly, if you deign to perform research in this laboratory personally, then you, and your staff, will find your research accelerated by an order of magnitude as research cycles blaze by and prototype units roll out of machine shops far more quickly than possible, so long as you personally spend at least 40 man-hours a week performing research of some kind, with lesser boosts available if you spend less time contributing to the labs productivity."
600 CP,Starro-tech Notes,Young Justice,"These notes detail the research Professor Ivo, Brain, and Klarion The Witch Boy took in order to create Starro-tech; a combination of technology, magic, and an ancient alien organism. With time, and some studies of your own, you may be able to apply the principles of Starro-tech to your creations as well, creating technology and creatures that have features of living beings, magic, and technology."
600 CP,Kwa Holocron ,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"An ancient holocron, made by the amphibious Kwa long before the pilgrims who would become the Je’daii first set foot on Tython. It contains their knowledge of the galaxy, the Force, and their Force based technology. While the Kwa can’t measure up to the Celestials, many of their technological wonders remain unmatched by any later individual or civilization.
"
600 CP ,Unending Innovation!,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"Dead ends are a constant problem with science, certain things simply don’t seem to have any further ability to grow and at times that may be correct. For you though it’s no issue, as long as you continue to pursue more advanced and better tech you’ll always be able to find new and creative ways to expand the metaphorical tech tree. Whether its discovering the principles used to breach Hyperspace might yet be applied to other dimensions, though developments of that level are a ways off. "
800 CP,UAC Mars Facility ,Doom 3,"One of the most advanced scientific research stations in the solar system, the UAC's Mars facilities work on everything from energy production and terraforming to Archaeology and teleportation. It is one of the pinnacles of human achievement and now, it is yours. Or at least, a copy of it is - perhaps one far enough away from the original that it's safe from the coming demonic invasion? Coming with a full complement of (mostly) competent staff as well as a wide variety of interesting technologies, the facility now operates under your command. Whether you decide to take a more active hand in their research or simply leave them to their own interests, they're guaranteed to come up with interesting ideas over time - usually in areas involving physics, weapons development, and so on. In future worlds, you'll likewise become the owner of a large, productive center of scientific learning, though it doesn't need to be on Mars as such.
"
800 CP,The Ruins ,Doom 3,"One of the most important fields of research in the UAC Mars base involves physics, dimensional technologies, organic technology, and many more things but it starts with history. Beneath the base lies a vast network of ruins, burial chambers and other structures belonging to the long-dead inhabitants of Mars - a people that some theorize are in fact the ancient progenitors of humanity itself. Though heavily damaged and weathered by the passage of time, many of the devices within still function, and the inscriptions recovered from the Martian dig sites have contained information beyond anything humanity understood - leading to some of the most advanced scientific theories of the modern day. You are now in charge of a sizable dig site working through these ruins, with direct authority over the discoveries made within. In future worlds, you will likewise come into possession of a similarly vast Archaeological site, belonging to a suitably powerful precursor from the setting you are in. Predicting what kind of advances might be realized through investigating these ruins will be difficult but no matter what, results will always be spectacular in some way.
"
800 CP,Forerunner Trove-,Halo - The Covenant,"The actual physical device you receive is unassuming- a physically small data drive. Though it will take decades to pry it open and truly access its secrets, and longer yet to make any sense of them, this time will be well-spent indeed. Inside this are the ancient secrets of the Forerunner empire- the means to create their most powerful weapons and mightiest fortresses. Perhaps you should desire to create a mighty fortress ship, that could take gigatons of explosive damage without its shields breaking? Or perhaps, you would wish to create the shield worlds- the incredible hollow worlds that are the only structures known to be able to withstand the halo array. Perhaps you should seek to recreate the Domain- the galaxy-spanning network of knowledge that all who are of sufficient mental strength can tap into, that they drink from the font that is the collective wisdom of the galaxy. Or perhaps you desire an even darker purpose- the creation of your own halo array, that you may scour untold galaxies clean of life. All of these shall be child's play for you, once you have spent the needed time. And make no mistake- you must spend untold time to truly pry open this shell, and understand its ancient knowledge. It will not be a task that is possible to complete in one universe, but when you stand as master of the heavens, there will be no question as to the worth of this data."
