0 CP,Grog ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"A strong ale brewed from the nutrient-rich algae that is a Squat staple. Technically a couple mugs could substitute for food, but it’s got a kick you probably won’t enjoy on an empty stomach. Each purchase grants one keg that refills nightly."
0 CP,Vault Canteen ,Fallout Series,"One of the promotional items for the Vaults, this blue canteen is marked by a yellow number representing which Vault it was promoting, defaulting to 13. But that's not what makes it special, as this specific canteen never runs out of fresh, clean water. I hope I don't have to explain how valuable this will be in an irradiated wasteland."
0 CP,Royal Honey,Futurama ,"A refilling jar. A single spoonful calms you down and a second causes you to fall asleep but
the third will put up in a state of sleep so deep you will never wake up."
100 CP,Portable Medical Sensor ,Stargate Atlantis,"A palm-sized device with a separate scanner, it's very similar to a life-signs detector, but instead
provides images of a subject's internal organs and data on their biology, injuries and general condition."
100 CP,Data Port,Andromeda,"You can choose to have a data port added to your body to allow direct access with your mind to technology. This does include protections from hackers, and vengeful AIs."
100 CP,Hypospray,Star Trek - Lower Decks,"A medical device used to inject liquids into the body. The system used a noninvasive transport
mechanism of compressed air to transfer the injectant from the device into the subdermal layer
below the skin of the body, or artery without the use of a needle."
100 CP,Stimpack Pouch ,Fallout 3,"Seeing as there is always something looking to kill you around every corner, it would certainly make life easier if you could heal yourself. Luckily you can! This small bag contains twenty five Stimpaks that are replenished weekly. Stimpaks boost the body's own regenerative properties, causing faster healing, though it's not very effective against major wounds."
100 CP,Radiation Kit,Fallout 3,"In case you didn't realize, radiation is a serious concern in the Capital Wasteland. Eventually, you will run into it, and you'll definitely want this around. This small cooler has 25 Radaway and 10 Rad-x which are replenished weekly. Radaway purges your body of radiation, while Rad-x increases your resistance to it."
100 CP,Translator Microbes,Farscape,A box with 8 syringes full of translator microbes. Empty syringes refill over night.
100 CP,Genetics Lab ,XCOM - Enemy Unknown,"A lab dedicated to the genetic and surgical enhancement of soldiers. Can be used for Gene-Mods, and is handy in dissecting and replicating future enhancements."
100 CP,Cybernetics Lab,XCOM - Enemy Unknown,"A lab for the creation of MEC Troopers and the research, development and implantation of any cybernetics."
100 CP,MIU Implant ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Unlike the electro-grafts which transmit information, the mind-impulse unit is designed to transmit
somatic and sensory data between an organic mind and prepared device, usually a vehicle. It allows
for the control of a machine's functions as if they were direct extensions of the adept's body. This
model can be easily programmed to interface with any number of devices, and will allow for
seamless and intuitive control over all standard template construct patterns."
100 CP,Spice Cache ,Dune,"This is 10 decagrams of Spice (1/10th of a kilogram). It’s worth enough to live on for a decade in this universe. It is worth 5,000,000 Solaris or roughly 50,000,000 Dollars US. You get another 10 decagrams every day, and in other universes, you won’t have to convince people that it really is Melange. It is just as addictive and powerful in other universes as it is here. You also gain a plate of 18 freshly baked Spice Cakes, 24 pieces of Spice Candy, and enough Spice Coffee to make 36 cups every morning. Consuming Melange can slow the aging process drastically, enhance intelligence, reflexes, and general awareness. In large doses it can also counter poisoning. Prolonged use turns the eyes blue on blue and using it to excess generation after generation can lead to profound physical mutations and genetically enhanced psychic powers.
"
100 CP,DNA collector,Underworld,A set of syringes that allow you to draw blood or bone marrow from a person. The syringes can’t be broken and there is always trace remains after use allowing you to gain an infinite supply if you know how to make recombinant DNA. 
100 CP,Medi-Gel Kit ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"There comes a time in every man's life when he has been shot full of holes, and can't get to a hospital fast enough. Luckily, there's the always helpful medi-gel, a medicinal salve combining an anaesthetic and clotting agent used by paramedics, EMTs, and military personnel. It heals various wounds and ailments, instantly sealing injuries against infection and allowing for rapid healing by having the gel grip tight to the flesh until subjected to a frequency of ultrasound. You get a replenishing stock of twenty packs each week, along with notes on how to make more."
100 CP,Translator Implant,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Definitely one of the more useful implants, this cranial implant contains a database that perfectly translates any language you hear into your native language, allowing you to actually understand anyone. Doesn't help you with speaking their language, just understanding it."
100 CP,Ocular Implants,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Most species depend on their eyes in order to properly interact with the world around them, so maybe that's why these implants are so popular? You have undergone a procedure that replaced your eyes with these fancy new ones, allowing you to have 20/10 vision, as well as having alternate settings that you can switch to at will, those being night vision and thermal vision."
100 CP,Bone Reinforcement,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"It should come as no surprise that your bones are vital for the structure of your body and the protection of your squishy insides. Having been reinforced by a special titanium alloy, your bones are much more durable than before, if a bit heavier. This makes them harder to break, obviously, and doesn't interfere with your ability to replenish blood."
100 CP,Sacred Hospitaller ,Imperium Nihilus ,"Bleak, brutal, cruel, and yet ultimately necessary. Such is the mandate of an Inquisitor and to ignore that reality is to deny the truth of the world. But while cruelty and brutality both have their place within the galaxy, that does not mean that there is no place for kindness, no place for simple good-old fashioned hospitality. And that is why you’ve taken measures to ensure that you will not forget that fact. Whether you learned from the Orders Hospitaller or even the apothecaries of the Adeptus Astartes, you’ve gained a substantial degree of both medical skill and knowledge. You certainly wouldn’t be out of place within the Voidborne Hospitals of the Imperium. In fact, they would be more than welcome to have you aboard. Be it simple first aid, triage, or even surgery, you’re a certified master at keeping your patients alive from all but the most grievous of wounds. The galaxy may be dark and grim but that’s no excuse to let your fellow men die."
100 CP,Toxiphage ,Imperium Nihilus ,"Rather simple in concept but so very useful nonetheless, a toxiphage is an implant that, when made part of one’s body, serves to neutralize any toxin or drug that enters their system, affecting anything stronger than caffeine, including alcohol. You can see how useful this would be in your line of work. However, it is only right to warn you that while this implant works wonders on ordinary toxins and drugs, its efficacy when utilized against more supernatural attacks is considerably more varied. Still, people would and have killed for something like this."
100 CP,ProziumTM ,Equilibrium,"The Great Nepenthe. This wonderdrug eliminates 85% of a human’s emotional range, leaving them somewhere in the middle of all ranges. It does so without toxicity, without side effects, and without apparent acquired resistance. Every citizen of Libria has an injector that carries 5 ampules of Prozium, dosed specifically for their metabolism. It must be administered 2-4 times daily, by law. It can be resupplied at any of the several dozen Equilibrium Locations placed conveniently around Libria, for
free."
100 CP,Spice Tolerance,Dune,"The Spice expands consciousness, slows aging, enables the Navigators to fold space, the Reverend Mothers to tap into Ancestral Memory, and expands the transhuman computational skills of Mentats. It also turns human eyes blue and mutates the Navigators into inhuman monstrosities... and of course, it is horribly addictive... except to you. You are immune to both the addictive properties of the Spice and the negative aspects of it as well. It will still give you the blue on blue eyes of an addict if you take too much, but in your case, if you stop taking it, the blue on blue will eventually fade. Other addictive drugs (such as the Juice of Sapho and its ruby lips) are similarly unable to fully grip you, providing all their upsides with no downsides.
"
100 CP,Rejuvenation Treatments ,Elitie: Dangerous,"In this universe, there exists a form of engineered cells referred to as Progenitor Cells that can restore damage in older human cells; in effect, these can greatly extend the human lifespan to hundreds if not thousands of years. Whether you’ve undergone some of these miracle treatments, or something else, you are now biologically immortal and ageless; you’ll look the same in a hundred years as you do today."
200 CP,Protein Regenerator ,Lexx,"This advanced medical device is capable of repairing any form of organic matter. A skilled
operator, with knowledge of their subject’s anatomy can repair physical trauma, reattach
severed limbs, and filter out any diseases or toxins. It cannot create biomass out of nothing,
though it can be used to repurpose existing material. While it cannot bring back the dead on
its own, it can restore a corpse to a perfectly pristine condition and regular uses can stave off
decay. This device does not work on inorganic matter, including formerly living tissues that
have been decarbonized."
200 CP,Lusticon,Lexx,"This is the machine that turns humans into Love Slaves. Taking the form of a long table with
straps for holding the subject down during the process, a qualified operator can reshape the
subject’s body into a fit and attractive form, enhance the subject’s libido, brainwash the
subject into falling in love with the first person they see, and install an expiry date. Expiry
dates will cause the subject to drop dead anywhere from a few hours to up to 79 years from
the time the expiry date is installed. Any of these processes can be changed, reset, or
reversed with another use of the Lusticon."
200 CP,Musculature Enhancement,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"By inserting specialized implants meant to reinforce muscle tissues and sinews, as well as increasing the speed of muscle regeneration, you will easily be three times as strong as the peak your species could naturally achieve through training. This reinforcement also means that your musculature is harder to pierce through, offering slightly improved protection."
200 CP,Biotic Implants ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Biotics have changed how many races approach battle, but none can deny their usefulness. If you have biotic abilities, then you will find them moderately increased in scope and power. But should you not be a natural biotic, you will instead have eezo nodules grafted onto your nervous system, turning you into a biotic of decent, if below average, power."
200 CP,Subdermal Armor ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"This option is for when your kinetic shield is down and your armor doesn't cover everything. After an intensive surgery, you now have a nanomesh weave underneath your skin, offering you a great deal of protection. You are now effectively immune to small guns fire, and a shotgun blast will give you some nasty bruises, but you still aren't invulnerable."
200 CP,Medic,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Inevitably, there will be a time when your skills might not be enough, and
those who fight by your side will end up injured. How fortunate for them that you are a
trained combat medic, able to patch up most damage sustained during a fight within a
few seconds. Additionally, any healing items that you administer are twice as effective."
200 CP,Wraith Enzyme ,Stargate Atlantis,"A refrigerated cooler, the type transplant organs are kept in, holding IV packs of the enzyme Wraith use to keep you alive while they leech the life out of you. In its pure form, it's an imperfect super-soldier serum. It amps physical speed, strength, pain tolerance and natural healing - but is addictive, has vicious withdrawal symptoms and seems to affect the subject's brain, making them over-aggressive, overconfident and possibly prone to lapses in judgement. Can be added to food or delivered via injection. Contains just enough to keep a long-term user at their peak for a week, or dose up seven or eight people all at once, and replenishes weekly."
200 CP,Lantean Medical Scanner,Stargate Atlantis,"A bed to lie on with a scanning unit affixed. The Lantean version of an MRI, can quickly provide internal images of a patient's whole body, detecting illnesses, infections, injuries, abnormalities and even nanites, altered brainwaves and genetic anomalies. User friendly."
200 CP,Extremis Formula ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"Another attempt at creating super soldiers, this formula creates a virus that can enhance a person to superhuman strength, reflexes, and endurance. Additionally, normal Extremis users gain the ability to generate extreme amounts of heat through a complex metabolic process, generating heat from their bodies up to several thousand degrees Celsius on any part of the body they desire. When regenerating body parts, the wounds take on the appearance of burning ashes while growing back the lost body part, in a matter of minutes, and cooling into regular skin, flesh, and bone. Be wary however, as this makes you light up on thermal sensors, and should your body heat up too much, you may end up exploding. Keep this in mind.
"
200 CP,Chem Kit ,Fallout 3,"The drugs you'll find around here are much more potent than you'd expect, and have a number of useful applications. With the exceptions of Stimpaks, Radaway, and Rad-x, this cooler contains all drugs found in post-apocalypse America. Jet, med-x, psycho, mentats, buffout, the works."
200 CP,FEV Vats,Fallout 3,"The Capital Wasteland is plagued by the escaped experiments of Vault 87, where they were testing a variant of the Forced Evolutionary Virus. But if you want to continue those experiments, or simply give hope to a doomed people, you will find yourself in possession of five vats of the FEV. They will constantly replenish the green ooze whenever it's used, and can even be modified. Perhaps you could crack the code?"
200 CP,Velocity 6 ,DC - Arrowverse,"A designer drug designed by Harrison Wells of Earth-2 and Caitlin Snow. Wells started the drug design to help Jay Garrick in his battle with Zoom, but the first 5 versions were failures. With help of Snow's biochemistry knowledge they perfected the drug. The drug temporarily enhances a Speedster's connection to the Speed Force or temporarily restore a Speedster's connection to the Speed Force. When taken by a non-Speedster it grants them brief access to the Speed Force, allowing them to run at 100mph but they're unable to pull off Speed Tricks as a true Speedster. Comes with six vials and the formula to make more."
200 CP,Fancy Medical Trainin’ ,Firefly,"You are a trained doctor, top of your class at the MedAcad. You’re trained in thousands of different miraculous medical technologies, and are a top surgeon who never loses a patient. At least, so long as you’re in a properly equipped OR. You can prescribe medicine, and even have a small “emergency stock” with you that would put most backwoods clinics to shame."
200 CP,Krillitane Oil ,Doctor Who,"Some nifty stuff, this. This is Krillitane Oil, highly concentrated and top quality. What it does is that it makes human minds massively, impossibly cleverer. While not close to what you are with Omega-Level Intellect, your learning capacity, retention, general inventiveness and processing abilities are boosted to massive, ridiculous levels all the same, making you, or anyone else you feed it to, a genius second only to someone who can be said to have the above perk. It also kills Krillitanes on contact but that’s a feature, not a bug. Unfortunately, not really useful to you once you leave this setting. You receive a barrel of the stuff, and another every week."
200 CP,Cybernetic Eye ,Deadpool,"Give yourself an upgrade with the Cybernetic Eye. Forget about normal vision—this sucker comes with tactical HUD, thermal imaging, night vision, and X-ray vision. It locks onto targets, scans threats, and highlights weak points. It’s like having a cheat code for everything. Not to mention, it looks pretty badass. If Cable had one, why shouldn’t you?"
200 CP,Drug Glands,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Vat-grown and gene-tailored, these artificial organs release combat drugs into your system with the
proper mental trigger. The hyper-drenalin cocktail boosts strength and reaction time, and
suppresses the feeling of pain. While the glands are also designed to filter out toxins and mitigate
the side-effects of these or any other drugs in your system, using the glands too often and too
quickly risks damage from the buildup of toxic by-products."
200 CP,Rejuvenation Tank ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"This is the rejuvenation tank that was used to keep the original form of General Grievous alive for years despite his incredibly damaged body. This pod is capable of bringing anyone back from the brink of death and even removing severe conditions such as cancers. In addition you will receive the blueprints needed to create more of these tanks as well as other similar types like the standard bacta tank.
"
200 CP,Predator Medkit ,Predator,"In return for a few moments of agonising pain, this medkit stops bleeding, neutralises poison and infection, and the physical handicap the wounds would give you, as well as drawing out shrapnel or embedded bullets. For all intents and purposes, the wound won't bother you any more, though you'll need to rely on your own healing to actually fix your body up."
200 CP,Biomancy,Imperium Nihilus ,"When someone thinks of a psyker, the first image that often pops into their mind is a man hurling forth bolts of lightning from their fingertips. And if you want to be like one of those psykers, it’s best to start off with Biomancy, the art of manipulating the biological energy and processes of themselves and of others. With this, you’ll not only be able to conjure up lightning from your body, but you’d be able to heal yourself and your allies, shape your body to your whims, or turn the flesh of your foes into bloody works of art. The Mechanicus may decry the flesh and its weaknesses but to a powerful Biomancer, the flesh is mightier than any metal."
200 CP,Adamantium Skeleton ,X-Men - The Animated Series,"Like a certain Canadian mutant your bones have been laced with the night-unbreakable metal known as adamantium. While this won’t necessarily prevent you from all harm - Wolverine died at least twice in this period in bad futures and was ripped in half by the Juggernaut- you won’t be suffering from broken bones at least. Perhaps more importantly is that this upgrade also changes your skeleton to have 3 blade-like claws which can extend from the back of each of your hands. Like the rest of your skeleton these claws are coated with adamantium, and deadly sharp, able to cut through most materials with ease."
200 CP,Clone Mania,X-Men - The Animated Series,"You are master of cloning technology, with the right resources you can clone even the unusual mutations, such as those of mutants like the entire X-Men, or possibly, yourself."
200 CP,Healing Factor ,X-Men Evolution,"You possess a high-rate of cellular regeneration with far greater speed and efficiency than a normal human. This healing factor allows you to heal from superficial to deep and serious wounds in a couple seconds along with missing limbs or anything internal in a at most a minute. Even falling from an airplane, landing face first on the ground, and breaking every bone in your body won’t keep you down for more a few seconds. This regeneration also makes you immune to all forms of illnesses, poisons, and diseases. You are nigh-impervious to age & cellular decay via constant cellular regeneration so expect to live a few centuries in your prime before starting to see slimmest glance of aging."
200 CP,Phoenix Gem,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"When Asuryan was laid low by the C’Tan, the mother goddess Isha drew the heat of a hundred suns into a single gemstone to revive the king of the gods. This gem is but a small fragment of that one, yet it retains the power to revive the recently slain."
200 CP,Cupboard full of Bottles,Girl Genius ,"Specifically, an extraordinarily extensive collection of poisons, antivenoms, enhancers and a
whole lot else! You have every venom from the Resplendent Immolation to ‘Aunty Mehabitel’s
Natural Causes’, the entire Movit series of stimulants, and pretty much all the other stimulants,
poisons and antivenoms this world has to offer."
300 CP,Rejuvenation Shower ,Red Dwarf,"Restores the user to the prime of their youth. Will come as a flat pack and CANNOT be used to time travel, regardless how bad you are with an Alan key."
300 CP,Field of Heart-Shaped Herbs,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2),"Out of all the Wakandan secrets that lie within the borders of the reclusive city, this one is the most potent secret of them all. It is also the most dangerous. It is a small but potent field, its soil infused with radiation from the ancient Vibranium meteor when it fell to such an extent that it would affect any plant life growing within it, like these herbs. The herbs are taken and ground up so that it may be imbibed, and when the imbiber is buried under a light covering they will find themselves on a spiritual journey to talk with their ancestors... and then rise a greater warrior. Strength and speed that reaches the lower levels of superhuman, durability to survive explosions with minor injuries. Perfect coordination and balance with agility that far outstrips Olympic athletes. It would not be too farfetched to say that the results of this herb match even the ones derived from the Super Soldier formula that made Captain America... and now you have a small field of these plants. Be very careful
"
300 CP,Cadmus Cloning Projects,Young Justice,"These are outlines of the cloning and other related projects Cadmus has undertaken, including the creation of the Genomorphs, implanting memories/programming, and the creation of Human-Kryptonian Hybrids, as well as the blueprints for the special machinery used. You can apply the same principles to create hybrids of your own. "
300 CP,Goblin Formula,Spider-Man Trilogy,"You’ve gone through the Goblinization process, in which some rather dubious medical experiments were performed upon you in an attempt to create a super soldier. Unlike a certain other individual, this process has not driven you insane, instead the goblin has fused with your consciousness, increasing your willpower and determination greatly. The main benefit of the formula, however, is the increase to your strength and physical attributes. You can easily toss people around, and throwing a certain
web-head through solid brick walls is well within your capability."
300 CP,Health Serum ,Rick and Morty - A Way Back Home,A replenishing supply of serum that can and will heal all physical biological injuries of any biological species over the course of 24 hours.
400 CP,Juvenant Drugs,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"You possess the bio-formula and equipment needed to provide rejuvenant treatments, which are
capable of reducing a human's effective age. You can still produce and administer the treatments
without a full understanding of biological sciences, but this will severely reduce their effectiveness
in the long term and likely introduce complications. A magos with the appropriate skills can apply
these treatments to best effect, extending the life of a normal, un-augmented human to almost five
centuries of age before conventional methods begin to fail."
400 CP,"Clones, Clones and More Clones!",Star Wars - Dark Empire,"This is interesting, is it not? Located in a location of your choice is now a set of twelve cloning tubes, each holding within a perfect, or, to be more precise, as close as one can get, copy of you in your prime within. On their own the vessels are empty of sapience and intent, making them well suited to be used as replacements should your own body falter. Of course, a master of the dark side could certainly find other uses for such superb specimens, I imagine. Naturally, the clones will replenish within a day should they be used."
400 CP,Room of a Thousand Fountains,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"Much like the chamber in the Jedi Temple of Coruscant, this room promotes serenity and deep contemplation to any inside. This purchase goes somewhat beyond the currently existing room however, granting a number of benefits beyond the original. The waters of this room provide purification to any who bathe in them. Sith lords would be brought to the Light, diseases and poisons can be driven from the body and the eternal cynic might come to see the inherent good in others. On top of that, you’ll find any classically ‘light’ powers are increased in magnitude several times over if conducted in or from this room."
400 CP,Divinity Machine ,Doom Eternal,"It is rare for a mortal to be blessed with divine power, even rarer for one to be blessed with the
permission of the Khan Makyr. But there have been extraordinary times before, and thus the Divinity Machine was created. By placing a person within, they are subjected to splicing of Makyr genetics and an infusion of holy energy, which not only ceases aging but grants noticeably enhanced strength and endurance. This kind of imbuement can only be done once, but seeing as it aided the Slayer in his eternal battle against the demons can the results really be argued against?"
400 CP,Operation Rebirth ,X-Men Evolution,This is some dangerous material that you've found. These plans are on the WW2 early gene enhancement that made Captain America. Included are detailed notes on how to create the rebirthing chamber and everything needed to mass create super soldiers on the level of MCU Captain America. The notes even contain a way to not make sure humans do not decay on a cellular level like the original Captain America did along with making sure humans also receive a long life and return to their prime years just like mutants do.
400 CP,V24,The Boys ,"You get a dozen vials of V24 every week. A modified version of Compound V. The serum gives a person 24 hours of superpowers per dose. The power received is random, but is usually on par with the powers of an average member of The Seven. Unlike the version used by Billy and Hughie, this version has no side effects."
400 CP,Lazarus Serum ,Smallville,"The pride of Metron Pharmaceuticals, derived from Clark’s blood, this little serum can cure everything from cancer to chicken pox, heart disease to shingles. If administered to a recently made and relatively intact corpse, they will return to life for twelve hours and then become immune to further doses of the serum. You gain three doses which are replenished weekly."
400 CP,Mirakuru Serum & Cure ,DC - Arrowverse,"A Japanese super-soldier serum created in WWII that causes enhanced physical strength, speed, endurance, toughness, agility, stamina, reflexes, enhanced senses, and an accelerated healing factor once injected. Many of these enhanced physical attributes are beyond normal human capability. The use of the serum is dangerous, as it can easily prove fatal to its subjects if not correctly administered.Other side effects included a reduction in self-control and enhanced aggression, to the point of subject having homicidal tendencies. It can also cause insanity and hallucinations that encourage aggression and homicidal acts in the subject. This comes with the formula to Mirakuru and its cure."
400 CP,Bottled Lazarus Pit Water ,DC - Arrowverse,"This plastic bottle is full of water from the Lazarus Pit, a magical water that brings back the dead and slows the aging. The bottle is enough to change a swimming pool worth of water into a Lazarus Pit. The bottle refills every jump and has no side effect of the crazies. Note that the Lazarus Pit can only bring back the body & memories, a special ritual is needed to bring the soul back. Fortunately for you, the Dummies Guide to Lazarus Pit comes included. The water is free of any pesky extra souls."
400 CP,Alchemist,Farscape,"Your knowledge of plants, animals, and chemicals allows you to mix up all sorts of different compounds. Finding cures to rare diseases, synthesizing fuel, and creating powerful hallucinogens, among other things, is a breeze for you."
400 CP,Regeneration Alcove,Star Trek - Voyager,"This might not be a particular piece of Borg technology unless you need it to be. As various different species might require special conditions to rest, recover, or survive in a universe with laws of physics different from the one they originated in. That shouldn’t be too much of a problem now. Consider this item an adaptive habitat, suitable for a single individual, altering however you need it to allow the recovery and maintain health of anything inside it. If you don’t have any specific requirements, it can
become a bed that allows restful sleep and rapid recovery from any problems that wouldn’t
require treatment from a medical specialist to resolve."
400 CP,Weapon X Serum,Deadpool,"Oh, you’re feeling a little weak? Well, here’s your fix: the Weapon X Serum! Just like the one that made Ajax all super-strong and annoyingly unkillable (until I, you know, killed him). Inject this stuff, and you get super strength, speed, and reflexes. You’ll also be able to take hits like a champ—no healing factor though, so don't go trying to Deadpool yourself out of a decapitation. But hey, now you can punch through walls and not feel it in the morning. Yay for unethical experiments!"
400 CP,Kobra-Venom,Young Justice,"You gain a supply of Kobra-Venom, a neo-steroid that’s capable of granting people and animals superhuman strength and durability at the cost of their normal appearance and size. You have six doses, which replenishes every other month, as well as the formulas for Project Blockbuster and Venom, as well as the knowledge of how to combine them to make Kobra-Venom. "
400 CP,Vial of Yaut'ja blood,Predator,"This small vial of fluorescent green Yaut'ja blood is known to have a strange effect on humans who consume it, causing their aging process to essentially halt – little surprise as Yaut’ja elders are said to live upwards of a thousand years (though few reach that age). Drinking this prevents aging and nearly all age–related health complications (dementia, muscle deterioration, Alzheimer’s, arthritis, heart conditions etc.) for one year. The vial refills every year."
400 CP,Auto-Doc ,Fallout Series,"When you're injured and there isn't a doctor you can afford, this is the best thing to have. Though it may look like a high-tech coffin, the Auto-Doc is a wondrous miracle of pre-War medical technology, capable of performing even the most complex medical procedures without qualified medical personnel. This one can heal all but the most severe wounds, purge the body of radiation, and can even do cosmetic surgery to make you look like someone else completely. It also has a personality chip you can turn on and off."
400 CP,ChanPal SuRecon Center ,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"Your warehouse gains the Surgical Reconstruction Center can be used for perfect surgical augmentations and implement intensive cybernetic enhancement with a 0% chance of complications or the operation failing

Anyone placed within this tank will be in a state of pseudo-immortality as they will not be able to die but may be in a state of unconsciousness depending on their state.
"
400 CP,Antigen ,Underworld,This is a biotech pharmaceutical company well known in certain circles for its innovation and experiments. It is fully staffed with technicians and security willing to do whatever you want. 
400 CP,Jumper Hospital,The One,"Your own private hospital! Well, not really. It’s completely open to the public, and provides care free of charge to anyone who needs it, but still somehow produces all the resources it needs to function and the wages needed to pay its employees (who are all Follower “NPCs” rather than full-fledged people, unless you import one as a companion, at least)—and all without attracting legal attention or impacting the economy. Operations performed in this hospital never have complications, and doctors never encounter either false negatives or false positives in their diagnoses and tests. But more importantly for you, is that whenever you are a patient in this hospital, it is completely impossible for anyone holding negative intentions towards you to figure out where you are. You will always be safe while being treated here."
400 CP,Absolutely Fabius,Emperor's Children Gauntlet,"You have all the skills of the Primogenitor Fabius Bile himself, you are a skilled apothecary certainly but your true specialty is cloning, you are one of the greatest masters of the Genetic Sciences since the Emperor himself."

Clones produced may also be imbued with their progenitor’s personality or one of your own design, better suited to your needs. Do note though that the more powerful a being, the more independent it’ll be and the more DNA you’ll require, unless defects aren’t an issue of course."

600 CP,Gene Seed Vaults,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"The most important organ placed inside a Space Marine is their gene-seed. The gene-seed is an organ used to facilitate the creation of an Astartes endowing them with the strength of their Primarch. This vault contains the gene-seed of all twenty legions and an unique gene-seed that belongs to you. The unique gene-seed will contain lesser versions of the perks and skills you possess allowing you to pass them down to your “children”. You may optionally restrict what is given by this gene-seed should you not wish to pass down your full potential or certain aspects of it. These stores will hold an unlimited supply of gene-seed allowing you to produce as many marines as you have neophytes. The final and most important feature of the gene-seed within the vault is that they have been streamlined removing any defects and ensuring full compatibility. If a neophyte dies it will be due to their weakness, not the incompatibility of their new organs.
