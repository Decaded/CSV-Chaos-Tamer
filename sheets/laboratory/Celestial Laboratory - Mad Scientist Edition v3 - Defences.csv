0 CP,Armor Plating,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 3,"A fortress only lives up to its name if it is durable as the name implies. Otherwise it’s more of a paper castle to be laughed at and toppled over on a sunny day. Fortunately, there’s enough Plasteel and Ceramite around the ruined city to start making bulkhead plating and thick protective layers to ensure that your domicile does not fall prey to the dangers that will arrive. Constructed walls are also included, for the purposes of keeping enemies from simply being able to pile in."

100 CP,Iron Halo​ ,Warhammer 40K -- Adeptus Astartes,"As much of a badge of office and a sign of valor as anything, an Iron Halo is issued to only proven veterans of the Chapter. In addition to signifying a Marine’s valor, it also contains a very powerful Conversion Field generator, making the already durable Astartes even harder to damage, the field capable of taking direct hits from Lascannons before burning out and requiring repairs."
100 CP,M3 Pattern Armor ,Aliens vs Predator,"This is a set of standard USCM armor and combat fatigues. It includes a helmet, comms, biometrics/camera link, greaves, torso armor.

100 CP,Leather Jacket,Fallout Series,"You know what's cooler than cool? You are, especially while wearing this badass leather jacket. It's surprisingly durable and has an emblem of your choice stitched onto the back of it. But the best part is that it's breathable, meaning that you won't be burning up while wearing this in a desert."
100 CP,Lucky Shades ,Fallout Series,"Are you feeling lucky, punk? Well, you should, as that's what these are for. This snazzy pair of shades not only protects your eyes from bright lights, but so long as you wear them, you will be luckier than before. Games of chance go more in your favor, you'll find slightly better loot, that sort of thing. For some reason, these shades will never fall off your face, regardless of how much you move around."
100 CP,Ballistic Weave,Fallout Series,"As good as armor is, sometimes it doesn't have the same flair as a nice suit or dress. You can fix that with this high-quality ballistic weave, granting any clothes pretty good protection from both ballistic damage as well as energy damage. You start off with enough for a three-piece suit, though it does replenish weekly, as well as there being notes on how to make more."

If it absorbs too much it will collapse, leaving the user vulnerable, but after 15 seconds it will regenerate."
100 CP,EVA Suit,Firefly,"You have a simple space-suit for extra- vehicular work, or work where you’re not sure you’ll continue to have a safe atmosphere. It has enough air for an hour or two, a high-rated line to secure you to a ship, and a little bit of armor to prevent you from being holed by contact with a hull, but it’s not something you’d wear to a firefight. Also, better make sure you seal it up properly!"
100 CP,Synskin,Imperium Nihilus ,"The Officio Assassinorum has a wide variety of wondrous devices and weapons for their living killing machines and while they may not be directly associated with the Inquisition at large, they work together often enough that, while difficult, it is not uncommon for someone like you to have access to their armories and reliquaries. You should have no problem with something like synskin, the trademark of the Imperium’s Assassins, for example. What you have is a canister of synskin, one that never seems to run out no matter how much you use. By spraying it onto your skin, it will serve as a bio-reactive bodyglove, one perfectly molded to your physical form. With it on, you’ll be rendered invisible to thermal imaging, night vision and you’ll find stealth to be far easier thanks to your now-silent footsteps. Not only that, but synskin can serve as a form of armor, around a third as effective as carapace armor. It’s easy to see why the Assassins are so terrifying if this is the least of their technology."
100 CP,Ignatus Power Armor,Imperium Nihilus ,"If you are looking for armor symbolic of the Inquisition and its duties, look no further than this particular model. Made and produced by skilled Mechanicus artisans, Ignatus Power Armor is, in many ways, the perfect example of power armor. With this, you’ll never need fear the vast majority of the foes you may encounter, the ceramite plates of your armor turning aside bullets and las-bolts with contemptuous ease. And thanks to the complex systems embedded within, you’ll fight as if you were unencumbered by the weight of the armor and your own strength is bolstered, enough that you could even provide a challenge against one of the Adeptus Astartes. Ignatus Power Armor may not be as advanced as the armor donned by the Space Marines, but it is well worth the price."
100 CP,S.W.A.T. Armor ,The One,"S.W.A.T. armor from the Anubis Universe, which resizes to perfectly fit anyone wearing it, regardless of body shape or size. It’s very useful for stopping blades or bullets... but it wasn’t designed to stop the impact from a super-powered punch."
100 CP,Spectra-Distortion,Warhammer 40k - Talons Of The Emperor ,"Spectra-distortion fields are created by highly sophisticated generators to conceal and protect their wearers. Capable of baffling sensors as well as natural senses, spectra-distortion fields can shift and adapt to show its surroundings, or bleed darkness around its wearer, masking them from view and providing protection from las weaponry as well. Either way, ranged attacks become significantly more difficult against anyone protected by this technology."
100 CP,Grav-Assisted,Warhammer 40k - Talons Of The Emperor ,"Your armor will be fitted with anti-gravity technology, rendering it effectively weightless at your discretion. This will speed you up immensely, and even allow unmodified humans to move around freely within heavy armor- even tactical dreadnought variants."
100 CP,Vranite ,Warhammer 40k - Talons Of The Emperor ,"When a Sister-apirant of the Silent sisterhood takes her final vows, she is presented a suit of this advanced power armor. Built with elements of both the power armor of the Astartes and the silicate mesh of Senelinte void mail, this armor provides significant durability and strength. Impressively, this armor allows its wearers to not only retain their full range of motion but to even enhance their reaction speeds. Traditionally, suits of Vranite armor aren’t environmentally sealed without additional equipment. You may freely assume you have this equipment or have modified your suit to be so."
100 CP,Tau Fio’Tak Principles,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 2,"A common problem with powered armor is that it is heavy. It is very heavy and without the servos and electrical mesh inside that helps aid the movement of the wearer it might as well be a metal coffin. Have no fear, for Stygies VIII has developed an ingenious solution via nano-crystalline metal alloys. Not only will this make your armor more resistant to corrosions, but will also make the armor significantly lighter to improve your speed and movement. Stygies VIII Tech-Priests are not responsible for the Tau making baseless accusations like you stealing their metallurgy secrets, because that is a fabrication."
100 CP,Force Fields ,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 3,"Protective fields are normally placed upon important members of the Ecclesiarchy, or the esteemed veterans of the Adeptus Astartes. They can turn killing blows into mere light shows, and tremendously increase the life expectancy of a warrior. It should come as no surprise then that there are force fields big enough for buildings and bunkers in order to let them weather a greater storm. They only can withstand so much punishment at once before they are overloaded, but any damage spared can be worth it."
100 CP,Void Shield Arrays,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 3,"Yet there is something far greater than a mere force field able to protect your fortress. Something that’s normally utilized to protect the Fortress- Monastaries of the Adeptus Astartes. The Void Shield Array is that very protection, capable of neutralizing very powerful attacks and sending them into the Immaterium to remove any danger. As a bonus, they can be recharged and reactivated when in the middle of combat, making them the very best in protection."
100 CP,Decoy Command Bunkers ,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 3,"You have your regular command bunkers, the places where your tacticians read the situation and relay orders to the grunts in the field. But if it’s assaulted, then it’s very well liable to throw everything into disarray and mayhem. Perhaps it’s time to borrow a page from the Alpha Legionnaire playbook. Using spoofing technology, proxy servers, and camouflaging techniques, you’ve made at least half a dozen false command bunkers that are both heavily defended and quite active on the vox networks. It will at least buy you valuable time as the enemy tries to figure out which one is the real one."
100 CP,Energy shield,Halo- The Covenant,"The Sangheili may throw themselves into enemy fire while screaming of their foolish honor, and the hated Unggoy may cower as they meekly charge the enemy without any proper equipment, but none of this befits a truly noble exemplar of the Kig-yar. This is one of the mainstays of the frontline infantry of your people- a hand-held shield capable of absorbing any and all plasma fire laid upon it- for a brief time, at least, and totally deflecting any of those clumsy human projectiles fired upon it."
100 CP,Command Centre,Horus Heresy - The Primarchs,"Your armour has an extensive array of communications devices and even a controller to be able to personally command mechanical troops while on the battlefield. With this armour you will be constantly fed a supply of information about what your troops are up to, letting you potentially micromanage your entire campaign directly from the front lines. This includes a nuncio-vox, both a beacon and communications device that makes teleportation and orbital landing mishaps near yourself near-impossible as well as letting you give direct feedback to artillery units to greatly improve their targeting accuracy. It also includes a cognis-signum, an advanced device consisting of an array of sensory devices, telemetry arrays, and other cogitator-assisted communications devices that both greatly improve your ability to command even in the thick of a whirling melee and makes it easier to spot hidden soldiers. "
100 CP,Storm Shield ,Warhammer 40k - Grey Knights,"A powerful defensive tool used by the Grey Knights, the Storm Shield can withstand both melee and ranged attacks, including hits from devastating lascannons or super-heavy weaponry. Shaped like the Crux Terminatus or other variations, the shield activates a shimmering energy field that crackles with lightning, effectively absorbing even the most intense blows. It pairs well with a Thunder Hammer for maximum defense and offense."
200 CP,Atlas Mech ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"When there are giant monsters, when one man isn't enough, when all else fails, there will always be giant fighting robots. Okay, that might be an exaggeration, but this machine designed by the human terrorist organization Cerberus is an impressive piece of tech. It combines the deadly armor and firepower of a YMIR mech with the tactical superiority of a trained pilot. Equipped with a powerful rocket launcher and a high-power mass accelerator cannon, powerful kinetic shields and a polycrystalline composite hull, it's sure to be a terror on any battlefield."
200 CP,Beskar Armor ,The Mandalorian,Traditionally worn by Mandalorian's Beskar is noted for it's extreme defensive properties able to block absorb and deflect any blaster fire from a gun smaller than a ships cannon and allowing the user to stop and hold the blades of lightsabers for a short time
200 CP,General Overcoat,Fallout 3,"This winterized overcoat was once worn by General Constantine Chase. Anyone wearing this will find themselves more charismatic, as well as their skill with firearms increased."
200 CP,Noir Suit ,The Boys,"A combat suit similar to what Black Noir wears, composed of Kevlar and a small percentage of titanium; it's bullet-proof and resistant to various types of attack (explosions, impacts, falls, among others). It’s also flame-retardant and insulated. The suit also comes with a pair of daggers that can cut through most Supes."
200 CP,Power Armor,Fallout: New Vegas,"A fine suit of Power Armor with the design (and paint-job) of your choice, a level of protection greater than even a T-51B suit, a huge increase to your physical strength and a tesla drive improving energy based attacks. Comes with basic operational training if you do not take Power Armor Training."
200 CP,"Armored Personnel Unit
",The Matrix,"It's not pretty, but it gets the job done. This bad boy is a hydraulic power battle suit designed for combat, primarily used in the defense of Zion. Its main armaments are two 30mm rapid-fire cannons attached to its arms, with all movement reliant on using the two joysticks in the cockpit. I would try to beef its defenses if I were you, though... it  doesn't have much in the way of pilot protection."
200 CP,Riot Gear ,Fallout Series,"An advanced design fielded in limited quantities before the Great War, this was a specialized model of combat armor used by the United States Marine Corps, Army units in the American West, and select law enforcement agencies. While not the most protective of armors, it certainly makes up for it in a number of ways. The helmet is equipped with a built-in radio, night vision, infra-red, and air filters. It has a kevlar vest protecting the torso, and a black duster covering it all up. So not only does it protect you, you’ll also look cool and isn’t that the most important thing?"
200 CP,Vault-Tec Security Armor,Fallout Seires,"Only those part of the Vault Security Department are authorized to wear these, though I doubt they really care. This padded, puncture-resistant vest is good against low-caliber rounds, and comes with a riot helmet with a hinged, acrylic visor. While wearing this, you'll find your skills with pistols and melee weapons slightly improved."
200 CP,Dark Cloak,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"This dark cloak has a perception filter that when Toggled passively hides your appearance and physical features beyond your general shape, it also conceals your presence so that it can hide any form of unique energy that you give off that could indicate who you are from abilities such as detect alignment or Ki sense.
"
200 CP,Necromonger Mask,Riddick,"A simple mask of your design that inspires a sense of dread and fear in all who see it. Strong willed individuals can still resist the effects of this mask. You may import a mask or helmet into this option, should you wish that chicken costume to scare people then feel free to import the mask into this option."
200 CP,Armour,Underworld,You have a set of modern combat armour made with ballistic spider silk. It can be worn like any other clothing and does not impede your movement. It includes a hood that blurs your face impeding both identification and action reading. 
200 CP,Terminator Armor,Generic Warhammer 40k,"Terminator Armor is advanced power armor typically made for Space Marines. It is even stronger than normal power armor and specializes in sheer combat power rather than maneuverability. Purchasing this will grant you an equivalent set of armor for whatever sub species you are. Meaning you can become probably the only normal human to ever get it 
"
200 CP,Shield,Marvel - What If,"Some symbols persist, even across timelines. Crafted from a unique blend of vibranium, adamantium, and even a little uru, this shield offers unparalleled personal defense. Virtually indestructible, this defense will protect you against physical blows, energy blasts, and even malicious spells that directly target you. Due to its unique composition, the alloy that makes up this shield will absorb a fair amount of energy. Once this reservoir is filled, however, the energy “overflow” and be reflected off the shield. This could let you direct a shockwave from Mjolnir or reflect a repulsor beam, turning your defense into your offense. Just be sure you’re up to carrying this thing. After all, symbols must be strong."
200 CP,Future Armor,Halo Gauntlet ,"Don't want to wait for an upgrade, this perk will instantly grant you the Mark 6 version the the MJOLNIR power armor, the iconic armor used by master chief in Halo's 2, 3 and 4. The mark 6 armor has superior shields, and enhances your physical capabilities much better than the other versions do. The mark 6 version of the armor is also capable of carrying an A.I."
200 CP,Shielded Helm,X-Men - The Animated Series,"This helmet has been specially designed to insulate the wearer’s mind against telepathic effects and sensory. While worn, telepaths (even empowered by the Phoenix) cannot read your mind or enter it against your will, nor can they sense your presence. There are too many telepaths in this world for a good villain to go unprotected."
200 CP,Displacer Field ,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade,"There comes a time when you’ve run into a spot of bad luck. It happens to everyone, it’s nothing to be ashamed of. What is a problem, however, is when said bad luck could potentially be the end of you. Everyone needs to do that part, and you are not allowed to die before your contribution is made. This wondrous device will see to it, immediately teleporting you away should you take a strong enough hit from a weapon to ensure you do not suffer too serious a wound. While the device works automatically, this version will be regularly scanning the area and guarantee you teleport to a place of safety at that moment. If nothing else, you’ll have a superb opportunity to get your wits about you."
200 CP,Tarentian Cloak,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade,"Yet another hallmark from the Dark Age of Technology, this gilded and impeccably soft cloak is one of the finest treasures of Ultramar after it was discovered on the Agri-World Tarentus by the Ultramarines. How lucky for you to have obtained it, then. Using the micro-bio support systems and the energy dispersal veins interwoven in the fabric, this cloak can negate the energy field of force weapons and power fields to reduce their effectiveness while surrounding the wearer in a strange field that accelerates the regeneration of their wounds. If worn with a powerful armor, then the wearer of this cloak would be a very powerful warrior indeed with durability unheard of."
200 CP,Camo Cloak,Imperial Guard Jumpchain,"Camo cloaks are a mesh made from cameoline that is both highly durable and exhibits an optically shifting pattern that makes it blend into the surroundings. With this, it is relatively easy to hide from unwanted attention. It is usually given to infiltration experts, scouts and snipers, though some Imperial Guard regiments are known to make it part of the standard issue kit"
200 CP,Hexxagrammatic Wards ,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 2,"The power of the Immaterium is potent indeed, capable of erasing enemies much like a farmer would harvest wheat. But that power is like an open flame, and it knows no master save whoever is using it at that exact moment. Veterans would tell you  that even then, there is no guarantee. This is the reason one protects themselves, and the Tech- Priests will provide sufficient wards within your armor as needed should you desire such protection. The wards are potent indeed, not only granting significant resistance against psionic attacks against your person but will make your armor protect against psionic strikes twice as effectively as it would have before. When the fire of the gods is used, it is not you who will be burned by it."
200 CP,Tau Self-Repair Systems ,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 2,"The vast majority of technological repairs are done by those who have attained the teachings of the Omnissiah, and it has been this way for millennia. Yet there will unfortunately be times where you do not have access to adepts or Techmarines, and should your armor suffer damage it could bode well. Lucky for you that Stygies VIII have your well-being in mind and have this fantastical gift from the Omnissiah and certainly not from the innards of Tau battlesuits. To imply that would be heresy. What’s not heresy is how this upgrade will detect damage done to the armor and proceed to use its stores of nanomaterials to seal and repair the armor to ensure it is in fighting condition, with the nanomaterial slowly generating over time using the armor’s power systems. Talk about convenient! Convenient and not stolen."
200 CP,Aeldari Holo-Field,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 2,"A good armor is one that ensures when you get hit that it never actually brings harm to you. A better armor is one that ensures you never get hit in the first place, and what a coincidence that Stygies VIII have developed a technology to prevent you from being hit, which was most definitely from their Forge World and not from any Aeldari that they looted after killing them. Using specialized holo-emitters controlled by a sophisticated computer network, it will create a field of distortion around your being that affects both physical and electronic perception to make precision targeting against you all but useless. Stygies VIII will warn you, however, that it is only meant to fool enemies and will not stop someone from saturating the field via battlefield barrage to hit you. They are certainly not speaking from experience, and will assure you of this."
200 CP,Barricades,Halo - The Covenant,"A collection of covenant barricades, guard towers, and other defensive structures sufficient to contain one hundred warriors and protect a pass of 500 meters in width. They can be stored
in your warehouse, should you wish to modify them, or they may exist in a miniature pocket dimension, not truly existing until you call them forth to be deployed. Their manipulation will be extremely easy so long as you are not in battle."
200 CP,Fury Armor,DC - The Fourth World,"If the Mega Rod is the primary tool of choice for the Furies, their armor is the most iconic. This set of armor is durable enough that a New God can withstand punches from an adult Kryptonian, and most bullets and energy weapons are casually deflected off of it. In addition, it is very light on your body and easy to move around in, as well as aesthetically pleasing."
200 CP,Battlesuit,Warhammer 40k - Tau,"You may choose one type of canon T’au battlesuit, ranging in size from the XV25 Stealthsuit to the XV88 Broadside, per purchase of this item, and receive the suit, it’s basic schematics, and a steady supply of ammunition and spare parts for the suit. Moreover, the suit in question will automatically grant you a moderate level of skill in its usage the first time you enter it. Furthermore, as piloting a Battlesuit is a high honor for the Fire Caste, you will be recognized as the legitimate owner and pilot of any suit you purchase here. The weapons loadout may be any standard option available to your suit."
200 CP,Power Armor Training,Fallout: New Vegas,All Brotherhood members are taught in the use of Power Armor but on your body you can really make it sing. You move as one with the armor with no loss of dexterity and instinctively know how best to position yourself to protect any weakspots so that bullets simply glance off you as you charge around as an engine of destruction on the battlefield. Semper Invicta!
200 CP,Auric Armour,Horus Heresy - The Primarchs,"Your armour is fashioned from the same auric-adamantium alloy as the Emperor’s Himself. This makes its construction material even more durable and resistant to damage than adamantium or ceramite, as well as giving it a snazzy natural golden colour, though you of course may choose any other colour to give it instead if for some reason you don’t want a bitchin gold pimp armour."
200 CP,SEP Field ,Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy ,"Someone Else’s Problem Field Generators are even better than stealth fields. An SEP field doesn’t make something difficult or impossible to see... it makes it so that anyone seeing it is likely to think “Eh, that’s someone else’s problem.” Unfortunately, this doesn’t work on people with hero complexes, busybodies, worry warts, or the hypervigilant, but everyone else it works just fine on. While Dumb Computers can’t be fooled, the smarter the AI the easier it is to fool them... unless they’re paranoid. You gain a SEP Field Generator that’s just the right size to cover a person or a personal vehicle, and knowledge of how to make more, and bigger ones."
200 CP,Forcefield Belt,Legion of Superheroes,"You have a belt that functions as a forcefield, capable of surviving blows from Kryptonians without having a dent in it... the ground beneath you, however, might give in if the Kryptonian is relentless with her assault."
300 CP,Conversion Field ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","A device that generates a protective energy field; when struck, this barrier converts the energy of impact into light, making a blinding flash when it stops an attack. The field can even protect against plasma blasts; however, it can only withstand so many attacks at once, so can be overloaded.
"
300 CP,Kull Armor ,Stargate - SG-1,"Become a black-clad juggernaut! Two layers of armor, practically bulletproof, and able to resist most energy weapons, this suit makes everyone realize who's the boss. As a plus it even comes with two energy repeater blasters that are slightly weaker than staff weapons, but able to fire much more rapidly. Be wary though, as kinetic force can still affect you and if fired at a high enough pressure, your suit can still be pierced..."
300 CP,Power Armored,Fallout Series,"There are few things that can make you feel invincible as being clad in power armor. And while walking around in a human-sized tank is great, it could be better. By purchasing this perk, any and all armor you wear is now five times as effective in protecting you and doesn't hinder your movement at all, allowing you to swim just fine even while wearing the humanoid equivalent of a small car. And while that would be well and good on its own, any armor you wear will now fully repair itself within the day. The more complex the armor and the more extensive the damage, the longer it will take to be repaired but it will be repaired all the same."
300 CP,Jakara Mirror Shield ,Imperium Nihilus ,"It’s not just the Caligari Conclave that has a rather curious amount of strange technology. Necromunda certainly won’t be caught lacking in that regard. Often seen as part of the Hunting Rigs favored by their nobility, the Jakara Mirror Shield is quite unique. Shackled around your forearm, this device is a miniature force field generator, one that produces a conversion field on par with that of a Rosarius. Unlike a Rosarius however, the field’s primary purpose is not to deflect incoming blows, even if it does the task very well. Instead, the field absorbs the energy of anything that strikes it and redirects it towards an array of containment devices by the shield around your wrist. Once redirected, you can focus this energy into the shield’s firing chamber and send it straight back at the source in a blinding blast of heat and light."
300 CP,Necron Phase Shifter,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 2,"The loyalty and brilliance of Stygies VIII is unquestioned, ignoring the endless barrage of questions from everyone else in the Imperium. The Tech-Priests will mention that such baseless comments are the product of envy from being incapable of replicating their technological wonders. This device, integrated into the energy generator of the powered armor, is proof of their brilliance. For a few moments the device will render the user hazy and indistinct as they become incorporeal, allowing shots and all forms of damage to harmlessly pass through them. Timed right, it could even let the user pass through walls! Accusations of it being stolen Necron Phase technology will be dismissed as firmly baseless, with the Tech-Priests requesting you do not alert the local Deathwatch group. They don’t want another fight over Imperial Sanctioned technology."
300 CP,Drukhari Shadow Field ,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 2,"Stygies VIII, the most trustworthy and honest Forge World in all the Imperium, would like to remind you of how efficient and capable their honesty has made them by this particular upgrade to your armor that will make you a bona fide terror of the field. This device when activated will create a potent field of energy around you that will not only act as a powerful protective field but also create a thick shadowy cloud that will keep you hidden away from enemy fire. Energy projectiles dissipate, while kinetic weapons lose momentum. Unfortunately, upon the field actually being pierced it will dissipate and require time to recharge, but the Tech-Priests ensure that is to make sure the technology does not break. They will also reassure that any Inquisitor who claims you are using Dark Eldar technology is simply trying to hustle you and that Stygies VIII would never lie when it comes to Imperial Sanctioned Technology."
400 CP,Anti-Telepathy Helmet,X-Men Evolution,This metal helmet comes in a color of your choice that serves a very important function besides looking like a cool ornament. Thanks to the technology wired into the helmet it is capable of blocking out all forms of telepathy. Not even the strongest telepathic attacks will ever get through the helmet and your own psionic abilities are not restricted but enhanced as well due to the tech as well.
400 CP,Ignatus Power Armor,Planetary Governor Jump,"The Ignatus power armour is the ultimate in personal protection, providing its wearer with unparalleled strength, durability, and survivability. Constructed from the finest materials and incorporating the latest in advanced technology, the Ignatus armour is heavily reinforced and virtually impervious to all but the most powerful weapons. It also includes an array of integrated systems and subsystems, such as targeting systems, life support, and environmental controls, all of which are controlled by the wearer's neural interface. The suit also has an integrated energy shield, which can be activated at will to provide additional protection against incoming attacks. With the Ignatus power armour, the wearer can enter even the most dangerous of combat zones with confidence, knowing that they are equipped to handle anything that comes their way."
400 CP,Personal Force-Field Device ,Stargate Atlantis,"A gem-like device that produces a personal force field and inertial dampening effect while still allowing filtered air to pass through it. You could be stabbed, shot, blasted, zatted, thrown off a tall building – none of it would harm you – but it’s basically like walking around in a full-body oven mitt. It doesn't have an air supply so you can still suffocate without compatible air around you, and there’s a trick you have to figure out to eat or drink. The mental trigger that activates it locks it to your biometrics. However, if the shield is left on for too long, absorbs too much damage, or sustains repeated strikes, it will expend its power source and deactivate, unable to be reused until fully charged again."
400 CP,Shiftsuit ,Aliens vs Predator,"An armored suit developed from captured Yautja technology, the shiftsuit provides just as much protection as a full set of USCM combat gear. It also comes equipped with a cloaking device, a helmet with air filtration, as well as a shoulder- mounted laser weapon – not quite as powerful as a plasmacaster, but just as accurate. It’s also got a smaller, pop-out laser concealed in the shoulder guard as a backup weapon or for those times when a sneak attack could come in handy."
400 CP,Medic Power Armor ,Fallout Series,"Scavenged from a set of armor found in the Capital Wasteland as well as other advanced technology, this modified set of T-60 power armor is not only fully upgraded, but it possesses a life support system that would put all others to shame. It offers potent protection from radiation, it’s water tight and has a small supply of clean oxygen, and inner cooling. The most important part is that it will automatically inject the wearer with Stimpaks and Med-X when needed, ensuring that they are always at full combat readiness."
400 CP,Chinese Stealth Armor,Fallout Series,"Developed by the Chinese to counter the American's brute force with subterfuge and deception, the Hēi Gui stealth armor is the ultimate expression of China’s mastery over stealth technology. This suit contains a portable device that generates a modulating field that transmits the reflected light from one side of an object to another. The end result is near-perfect active camouflage, one close to total invisibility. This stealth field can be activated whenever you want. And despite its focus on stealth, it's still adept at protecting its wearer from enemy fire."
400 CP,Mechanist Armor,Fallout Series,"This armor was crafted and worn by the eponymous self-proclaimed superhero, the Mechanist!
The Master of Machines constructed their armor to offer potent defenses, both from ballistic
weapons as well as energy weapons. While the cloth undersuit may seem like a disadvantage,
it is actually made from an advanced ballistic weave, offering just as much protection as
the metallic parts. While wearing this armor, you will find the quality of any machines
you create or repair greatly improved. As an added bonus, it can alter the wearer's voice."
400 CP,Shield Watch,Rick and Morty ,"This watch produces an invisible forcefield around your form capable of withstanding nukes with ease. It can reflect projectiles back into the aggressors, killing them. It can generate holo-clones that distract potential enemies, indicate whether an enemy has a clear shot at your body, fire a weaponry laser beam or shoot a concentrated particle beam that destroys the target on a subatomic level. It is also able to transmit messages from and/or intercept communication lines. And it can tell the time."
400 CP,Shiftshroud of Alanssair,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"A cloak that shifts the wearer slightly out of phase with their plane of existence, rendering them totally invisible. Once one of a dozen such artifacts that Craftworld Altalioc learned to make from a forgotten alien race far older than even they, today only one remains."
400 CP, Red X,Teen Titans (by PsychoAnon),"The kiddies better buckle up, cuz they're in for a hell of a ride. One way or another, you've gotten your hands on the Red X suit Robin created to try to trick Slade. This is one overpowered costume. It can cloak the user to make them invisible, teleport short distances, fire off sticky x shaped projectiles capable of restraining even Starfire, explosive shurikens, a grappling hook, powerful energy blasts, can open x shaped holes in the ground, can disrupt and shut off technology like Cyborg's parts and forcefields with X shaped projectiles and it even has an “X-blade” (no relation). It does take some skill to use all this stuff, but assuming you're good enough to use it, even the Titans would have a bad time trying to put you down. It never runs out of energy either, so no hunting for Zynothium. Nothin’ personal, kids."
400 CP,Honor guard equipment-,Halo - The Covenant,"This equipment, favored son, is such that it gives you great status and honor. To be set among the honor guard of the Hierarchs themselves is no small thing, and those who see you in this armor shall know the power which you herald and treat you with appropriate respect. Of course, it goes without saying that the armor itself is quite powerful, and can deflect glancing blows from even energy swords. The Energy stave that comes with it is also capable of cutting through armor with extreme speed, and has far greater reach than the vast majority of other melee weaponry within the Covenant."
500 CP,Refractor Field,Warhammer 40k - Night Lords,"Okay. All bullshit aside, your masters care about you. You must be the BEST of the damn BEST. Because, after they tore this from an Officer's chest, they gave it to you to stick onto your clothes or whatever you're rocking. A refractor field generator is a small device which projects a  rotective energy field around the user. Its effect is to disperse the energy of an incoming shot or blow over the total area of the field. The field, although less reliable than that of a rosarius, can stop even the powerful projectiles such as lascannon and plasma hits. This'll effectively grant you the protection of Astartes Power Armor... And then some, potentially. Why your masters deemed you worthy of this instead of keeping it for themselves is knowledge only they hold, but consider yourself lucky."
600 CP,War Suit,Justice League Dark Apokolips War Gauntlet," (600/Discounted with The Wrong Human or Neutralized): How else can a man
oppose a God? Or a fallen God stand against a New God? You are now in possession of the
most advanced War Suit Lex Luthor himself has designed. It allows for combat against
powerful superhumans, fires kryptonite infuses missiles and explosive rounds as well as
increasing your striking strength to stand up to Paradooms and even stall the original
Doomsday for a while."
800 CP,Mausoleum of the Arbiter,Halo - The Covenant,"Attatched to your warehouse is a replication of one of the holiest places in all of High charity- the resting place of the greatest, most honorable warriors of all the Covenant. In its center is the set of silver armor that is worn by the Arbiter. It will modify itself to see your needs met- whether this means space capability, or extreme heat survival. It is not, however, as powerful as the price would merit. But you can change that- for every honorable warrior that has fallen in valiant combat against forces other than yourself that you inter in the coffins in the sides of this Mausoleum, it gains more and more power in direct proportion to the total, collective honor in the room at any one given time. Should the walls be covered, ceiling to floor, with the corpses of great heroes, you will gain the power of a titan on the battlefield while you wear this silver armor."
