100 CP,Rad Resistance ,Fallout 3,"Radiation is an insidious enemy, as its invisible fires mutate and twist as much as it does kill. You should consider yourself lucky, as you are now fifty percent resistant to the effects of radiation, and can flush it out of your system more easily than before."
100 CP,Polyglot,Legion of Superheroes,"Most aliens who show up on Earth seem to speak English. Like them, you are incredibly skilled at learning languages. Within a day you can learn an entirely alien language enough to be proficient at it."
100 CP,Perfect Body ,Lexx,"Maybe you went through extensive physical training and conditioning. Maybe you went
through a version of the Lusticon. Whatever the case, your body is now capable of
performing at the absolute peak of human ability, you are in perfect physical health, and look
as good as it is possible for a human being to look."
100 CP,Reaper ,Smallville,"You can kill with a touch, instantly and painlessly. Unlike Tyler, you can control it so you don’t just kill everyone you touch."
100 CP,Livewire ,Smallville,You can shoot lightning blasts from your hands. Your Sith cosplay is now complete.
100 CP,Something wonderful has happened ,Star Wars Movie Compilation - The Skywalker Saga,"You have full control over your fertility and are able to control the general appearance of any children you have including what percentage of each species they are from any of the Alt-Forms of you and your partner they are, what they inherent and what other natural abilities they have.
"
100 CP,Enhanced Vision ,Superman - The Animated Series,Sight beyond sight. You can now perceive the full spectrum of light and possess telescoping x-ray vision that will let you see with perfect clarity through obstacles. This vision is blocked by atoms with a heavy nucleus like lead or depleted uranium.
100 CP,Sensory Deprivation ,Superman - The Animated Series,"With the brush of your hand you can suppress the senses of your foes. While robbing someone of their sight is obviously valuable, this power extends to more uncommon senses like pain or the sense of balance. Requires physical contact to work, ends immediately after contact is broken and can only block one sense at a time."
100 CP,Longevity,The Boys,Your natural life span has been increased so that you can live for decades without showing any signs of aging.
100 CP,Bullseye ,The Boys,"You now possess uncanny aim, only matched by the likes of Gunpowder and Eagle the Archer. While a normal gunsman or an archer may use their weapon to hit the target in the bullseye, you can hit it by making your bullet or arrow bounce off of a water pipe, through a parked car's passenger and driver windows, off a second support beam, which then hit the target."
100 CP,X-Ray Vision,The Boys,"Your vision allows you to see through any solid object or surface, with the exception of objects and surfaces that are lined with zinc. This also gives you the ability to see vast distances when you want to, at least several miles."
100 CP,Know No Fear,Warhammer 40k: Imperium of Man,"It would be a poor Astartes to cower in fear of a Hive Tyrant, no matter how understandable it may be to the common man. Thankfully, you are above such things, your transhuman mind incapable of experiencing fear at all, and you will not hesitate in the face of the actions you must perform to ensure that the mission is complete."
100 CP,Teleportation,X-Men Evolution,"You can teleport and spam it like there is no tomorrow with no danger to telefragging or being telefragged yourself. You can teleport objects along with you so long as you are touching them. The only limit at the beginning is a 2-mile radius and having prior knowledge of your location or sight of it. With time or training you’ll increase your radius, the amount of stuff you can carry, and can remove the line of sight necessity."
100 CP,Phasing,X-Men Evolution,You have the ability to indefinitely phase through matter organic and inorganic alike at will and can solidify your body in an instant. This power can be granted to any object or person so long as you touch the object such as a train phasing it through another one.
100 CP,Super Hearing,The Boys,"You can detect sounds from miles away. You can also use this to filter through sounds enough to detect a single person's heartbeat. You can tell when they are excited or anxious, even detect their blood pressure."
100 CP,Aqua-Form,The Boys,"You can turn your body into water and back to human form very quickly, this could allow you to avoid getting hit from most physical attacks, but you cannot use your body to drown someone unless they are in a tub, or you can fly and go into their lungs."
100 CP,Enhanced Reflexes ,The Boys,"Your reflexes are enhanced and are superior to those of the finest human athlete. You can use this ability to quickly overwhelm foes, dodge incoming attacks, and even react to Supes with super speed."
1000 CP,Last Son,Smallville,"Increasingly untrue as the show goes on, but you know the drill by now. Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Well, eventually that will be you. Like Clark, you’ve got some growing to do. Right now, you can lift a tractor no problem, run across town inside a minute, bullets will leave bruises and a speeding car could wind you. By the end of the decade, you’ll be up to the full Superman package, growing gradually physically and discovering powers
along the way. You should get x-ray and heat vision the first year, flight somewhere in year 5-10, boy that got needlessly complicated in the show. Sometimes a breakthrough can help you get things earlier, Clark discovered super-hearing when blinded, for instance."
1000 CP,Kryptonian Physiology ,Superman - The Animated Series,"You are one of the last Kryptonians, an almost extinct alien species. Kryptonians are virtually identical to human beings in appearance, but physiologically they are completely different. Under the influence of a yellow sun Kryptonians have the following powers: Super Strength, Super Speed, Super Durability, Enhanced Hearing, Flight, Enhanced Vision, Heat Vision, and Frost Breath. Despite the immense power Kryptonians possess, they also have several weaknesses. They lose their abilities under the light of a red sun, if they don’t receive enough yellow sunlight, or if they are exposed to Kryptonite. In fact, Kryptonite is extremely harmful to Kryptonians and prolonged exposure can kill them."
200 CP,Inventory ,Fallout 3,"There are so many neat toys left around now that the majority of those protecting them are dead, but isn't it a shame that you might not have enough space to take them all with you? Well fret no longer, as you can store anything you're able to pick up in a pocket dimension that only you can access. How much this inventory can store scales with how strong you are."
200 CP,Easy Interface ,Lexx,"By touching any control surface or interface port, or by simply being in range of its wireless
signal, you can operate any technological device with nothing but a thought. While this does
not bypass any security such as passwords or biometrics, you will be immediately aware of all
the functions you do have access to. You can also directly read any form of recording media
in your sensory range without needing a separate device, though again this does not bypass
security measures like encryption."
200 CP,The Peak of Ecstasy ,Lexx,"You might think bringing a person to the absolute peak of sexual ecstasy would require some
elaborate setup, or at least involve taking some clothes off, but that’s for amateurs. You can
manage it with nothing more than a really good kiss. You may dial the potency of this perk
anywhere from completely off to full power at will."
200 CP,Xenophile ,Lexx,"You have a kind of natural charisma that doesn’t effect members of your own species, but
draws in alien beings of various sorts. Whether it’s a carnivorous plant monster, a sentient
biotech weapon of mass destruction, or one of the fae, the stranger and more alien a being is
the more it is naturally inclined to like you. This interest can be platonic, but more often than
not it leans toward a romantic interest. This won’t necessarily make them safe to be around,
and it won’t inherently make them inclined to respect your wishes, but you can be assured
they do hold some manner of affection for you in their own way."
200 CP,Cluster Lizard DNA,Lexx,"Somehow your DNA has been spliced with that of an aggressive, predatory reptile known as a
cluster lizard. You have mildly superhuman levels of strength and endurance. You can
survive with some discomfort in hot, arid environments that would kill a normal human within
an hour. With some practice, you can learn to curl yourself into a ball and roll around at
speeds several times faster than you could run without getting dizzy. Finally, in moments of
extreme stress, you can temporarily transform into a full sized cluster lizard, complete with
thick, leathery skin and multi-segmented mouth full of sharp teeth capable of eating a human
alive in seconds. Upon calming down, you will revert to human form."
200 CP,Beyond The End Of Time ,Loki Jump,"Being outside of the conventional flow of time has had some interesting effects, whether it’s due to coming from an entirely different time-space continuum or living after the ‘end’ of time. Specifically, you and your possessions are completely immune to any sort of temporal effects that you don’t want to be affected by.
While others might be trapped in loops, shunted through time or have their age altered, such efforts are entirely ineffective against you or your possessions."
200 CP,Catlike Grace ,Red Dwarf,"You gain a sense of grace and flexibility almost impossible for regular humans to match. You would be the envy of world class contortionists. As well as this your reflexes become almost superhuman, able to react with speed few others can rival."
200 CP,Mind Tricks Don’t Work On Me. Only Money ,Star Wars Movie Compilation - The Skywalker Saga,"Your mind is incredibly durable allowing you to ignore any form of Mind influencing ability or effect while still being aware of what they are supposed to do. This allows you to bypass the effects of Drugs, Jedi mind tricks or even supernaturally induced hallucinations which directly target the mind. 
"
200 CP,Don’t try to grow up too fast ,Star Wars Movie Compilation - The Skywalker Saga,"You are able to actively control your age, the age of your companions or followers and any other willing participant without causing any disorientation or discomfort, so that a fully developed adult can transform into a baby and back again without any issues.
"
200 CP,Shapeshifting,The Boys,"You can change your physical appearance to that of any other human. Your voice changes as well, but your clothes do not."
200 CP,Super Control ,The Boys,"You know why most heroes' powers never go out of control? Neither do I. But don’t worry, for one reason or another you won’t lose control and make embarrassing mistakes like crushing someone’s hand while shaking it, accidentally melting someone’s face off with your heat vision, or running through a girl who wasstanding on the sidewalk."
200 CP,Fish Guy,The Boys,"You are not just a fish guy, You are THE Fish Guy. You are able to breathe underwater, swim at incredible speeds, and psychically communicate with and sense all forms of sea creatures. You can even have full conversations with them. This power can come with fins or not, depending on your wish."
200 CP,Burn In Truth ,The Boys,"You are able to spontaneously emit a large amount of energy from your body, creating a powerful explosion that does not harm you. The explosions can be powerful enough to blow up large buildings with ease."
200 CP,Translucent,The Boys,"Don’t let the name fool you. You can turn fully invisible. But be careful, your clothes cannot turn invisible, so you might wanna take flashing as a hobby."
200 CP,Shapeshifting,The Boys,"You can change your physical appearance to that of any other human. Your voice changes as well, but your clothes do not."
200 CP,Shrinking,The Boys,"You can shrink yourself down to the size of an ant. While shrinking, you’ll retain the strength and durability of your full-sized body."
200 CP,Intangibility,The Boys,"With a mere thought, you can turn yourself intangible, allowing yourself to pass through physical matter. Any inanimate object you are touching also passes through."
200 CP,Electro-Priest,Warhammer 40k - Grey Knights,"As a newly accepted member of the Electro-Priests, you now possess the ability to channel the sacred power of the Motive Force, manifesting as electricity. Your body has been trained and prepared to harness vast amounts of electrical energy without harm. This means you are completely immune to electricity, whether from natural sources or artificially generated currents. Whenever you are exposed to an electrical current, you will harmlessly absorb it, preventing any damage to yourself or those around you. The energy you absorb can be stored in batteries or capacitors for future use, allowing you to stockpile power for later applications. In addition, you can channel discharges of electricity offensively, using it to unleash powerful attacks against your enemies."
200 CP,Mental Fortress ,X-Men - The Animated Series,"There are more telepaths in this world than I bother to count, not to mention a myriad of other ways people have been using to control the minds of others. You now possess a mind that is protected from any form of external influence. However, this protection is not absolute, as the full might of the Dark Phoenix can breach these defenses, provided you are weakened."
200 CP,Vertigo,Young Justice,"Vertigo allows the user to use their mind to alter the senses of others, throwing them off balance and inducing feelings of intense dizziness and even making them think that up is down. "
300 CP,Possession ,Justice League: Unlimited,You're able to jump into humans and other intelligent beings for short periods of time. While you're inhabiting someone's body you'll be able to control their every move and speak with their voice but you can only stay in control over someone for an hour at most and a few minutes at least depending on their willpower. Additionally some magic users or magical individuals may prove resistant or outright immune to this ability.
300 CP,Essence Transfer ,Lexx,"You have the ability abandon your current body and pour your fundamental essence into another. This process requires close proximity with no more than a few inches of separation between you, and that both remain still for the few seconds it takes to complete the transfer. During the transfer, the essence is visible as a black cloud moving from one body to the other. You may transfer your essence into any body capable of housing a sentient consciousness, regardless of whether it’s a different species, an advanced computer, or even some forms of undead. Your previous body will die as you vacate it. The essence you pass on contains your memories and personality, as well as any perks, powers, or other fiat backed abilities you may possess."
300 CP,Obscura ,Smallville,"You can see through other people’s eyes, hear with their ears. Only one person at a time and it takes some practice to get the hang of targeting specific people."
300 CP,Heat Vision ,Smallville,"Your pheromones make you irresistible to anyone interested in your physical sex, people will cheerfully kill or die for you. But not anyone with a different preference, animals, aliens, etc. This can be toggled off."
300 CP,Heat Vision ,The Boys,"Two small, high-intensity beams, roughly the width of human eyes. The beams can be in any color of your choice. These beams are so powerful that they appear to be able to cut through almost anything. They are also capable of melting flesh and bone with ease and causing people to burst into gore."
300 CP,Star Light ,The Boys,"Electricity goes in, blast comes out. You are able to absorb the electricity from around you. And then fire blasts of intensely bright light from your hands which are capable of throwing grown men several feet and blinding anyone who looks directly at them. With enough mastery you can mimic flight by propelling yourself in the air, albeit you will never reach Mach 1 with this alone. You are also able to make your eyes and hands glow on command."
300 CP,Mental Coma,The Boys,"With mere eye contact, you can put a person into a coma and trap them inside a dream created from their own memories. You can free them if you choose to do so, otherwise they will stay trapped until they die."
300 CP,Plasmakinesis,The Boys,"You have the ability to create powerful plasmablasts. By utilizing charged particles, you can produce and manipulate electricity. These can be in the form of electrical discharges that are capable of sending full-grown adults flying backward with enough force to knock them through concrete walls. A sustained blast of energy can even incapacitate supes while inflicting pain."
300 CP,Animal Kingdom ,The Boys,"An Ant, a Gorilla, a Lion, even an Elephant, you can turn into any real life animal. You keep your level of intelligence, while gaining their levels of strength, speed, durability, and any natural weapon or ability
they may possess (ie. flying, breathing underwater, wall crawling, claws, or even teeth)."
300 CP,Teleportation ,The Boys,"Like a certain orphan, you can now teleport. The teleportation is instant, however your range varies and it can be taxing if you try to chain your teleportations. Initially you will only be capable of teleporting to where you see, but with enough training, you can teleport within 10 miles as long as you are aware where you want to go. Also, unlike Hughie,you can bring your clothes with you."
300 CP,Immortal,Young Justice,"Immortal makes the user, well, immortal, meaning they no longer physically age after a certain point, as well as becoming immune to non-magical disease and chronic ailments."
400 CP,Outside the Cycle ,Lexx,"Time here flows in an immutable circle. Everything has happened before and will surely happen again. But it would be incredibly boring to send you someplace where you couldn’t change anything. This perk renders you outside the concepts of fate and destiny. Prophecies and predictions never account for your future actions. Time travelers from the future always remember a timeline unaltered by your actions as if you had vanished at the exact moment of their arrival, or a timeline where you never existed at all if their arrival point was before you inserted into a given jump. Alternately, if you are the time traveler from the future, you arrive in a timeline where your past self vanished at the moment of your arrival. Time travel
mechanisms that rely on closed loops don’t have to have the loops closed to prevent a paradox when you’re involved."
400 CP,EMP ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Society nowadays is so dependent on technology, whatever would they do if all of that was stripped away from them. At will, you can unleash a powerful EMP wave that affects all forms of technology within twenty feet of you, with the exception of yourself, any cybernetics you have, and your gear. This has a ten second cool down, but that should be more than enough time to capitalize on their moment of weakness. Render the droids, weapons, and armor of your enemies obsolete, though I wouldn't recommend using this inside a spaceship."
400 CP,Rush,Smallville,"You’re incredibly fast, even quicker than a Kryptonian in the fullness of their power. You can run up walls, over water, and even eventually vibrate through solid objects!"
400 CP,You have that power too ,Star Wars Movie Compilation - The Skywalker Saga,"You can grant anyone access to a basic package version of any type of power you have access to such as the force, ki, Stands, conduit abilities or magic powers however their version may be different than your own reflecting how it would work if they got it through the normal method.
"
400 CP,Heat Vision ,Superman - The Animated Series,"A Kryptonian’s deadliest weapon. Heat vision is essentially a high-intensity laser that will scorch anything it touches. This laser is extremely precise, and can be used to heat up cold drinks or lobotomize people as necessary."
400 CP,Jinx'd,Teen Titans (by PsychoAnon),"Your enemy's luck has run out. You have the ability to fire off waves of “bad luck”, causing misfortune to whatever's hit, with you having at least some influence over just how this manifests. You could make objects fall apart, or create waves by hitting a body of water, or make a parked bus start rolling downhill rather than just make it fall apart. The limits of this ability are unknown; perhaps if you hit a person you could make their heart stop or make a machine instantly break down regardless of power, but this is unknown. What is known is that you shouldn't be messed with. Your foes will regret crossing your path."
400 CP,Way of the Void Dragon​ ,Warhammer 40k - Necrons,"Technology is but one facet of the Materium, but you are its master. The Void Dragon’s grasp of technology was the very inspiration of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and you retain a similar level of skill. Imperial Guardsmen will flee in terror as their tanks turn against them, the once loyal drones of the Tau will gun down their owners without hesitation, and you will laugh all the while."
400 CP,Kinetic Charging ,X-Men - The Animated Series,"Through skin contact you are able to charge an object causing it to turn (at least some of) its potential energy into kinetic energy in a large explosion. The larger the object the more time and energy from
you needed to charge it, so you’re unlikely to explode the Earth with just this power, with objects like playing cards being somewhat weaker than Energy Blasts, and larger objects like quarterstaffs being a bit stronger; in general if you charge a larger object you get a larger explosion."
400 CP,Force Field Projection,X-Men - The Animated Series,"Through concentration you are able to project a forcefield outwards from around yourself. This field is centered on yourself, though it may contain other people, and requires intense effort and concentration to maintain. It is powerful enough to withstand most energy blasts or withstand blows from a superhuman for a time."
400 CP,Gravity Increase ,X-Men - The Animated Series,"You are able to increase the effect of gravity on an object or creature. The longer you maintain this power the more strain it puts upon your body but you are able to geometrically increase the force upon an object
by gravity. Harold Leland, the canon possessor of this ability, was able to cause Wolverine (already heavy due to his metal skeleton) to break through floors quickly, cause Colossus to become so heavy he began to sink into the ground, and increase his weight to the point that even turning human once more did not save him, hold down the advanced sentinel Nimrod, and decelerate a man launched into the air before
re-accelerating him downwards to hit with the force of a small meteor although the strain killed him. Most likely as a healthy and fit individual, unlike Leland who was substantially overweight to the point of heart issues derived from it, you can do more. Leland was able to with great difficulty extend this power out to a maximum of 4 objects simultaneously."
400 CP,Illusion Casting ,X-Men - The Animated Series,"You are able to project illusions into the minds of others. This can cause them to see, feel, and perceive something as real even if they know it is an illusion. A strong enough mind can overcome this power -
especially when aware of it - and while possible to project the image into more than one mind simultaneously it can miss people when doing so. The power of these illusions is not limitless; someone perceiving a wall might be able to push through it with strength enough to break through a wall, and it’s better used for making a wall than something to hit them with as while they may perceive the force it does not create any actual force."
400 CP,Weather Control ,X-Men Evolution,"Just like the shamans who used witchcraft to control the weather you too have received the ability to control natural forces thanks to a psionic connection to air currents, water vapor, and natural electrical energy. In simple terms this means you are able to manipulate and control all forms of weather on both a large and small scale usually no bigger than a city at the start. You can sustain flight at high speeds in low atmospheres and are immune to greater levels of heat and cold without any ill-effects. Modifying the temperature and humidity of the environment by controlling the air molecules, controlling all forms of precipitation, flash freeze people, forming tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and bringing down lightning are just basic skills you’ll manage and with a bit of creativity can come up with much more."
400 CP,Organic Steel,X-Men Evolution,"You have the ability to transform your entire body into a form of ""organic steel"". In this armored form, your gain superhuman stamina, durability, and strength that is allows you to as toss buses and monster trucks into the air. It’s comparable to even the unstoppable Juggernaut of this universe who stopped a speeding train with a simple slap. While in this state you lack any biological needs of a human like food, sleep, air, etc to sustain yourself, and are extremely resistant to injury. High-impact assaults, large caliber bullets, falling from tremendous heights, extreme temperatures, and electricity no longer phase you. With training armor can be selectively formed over portions of your body instead of all of your body."
400 CP,Magnetism,X-Men Evolution,"You generate and control magnetic fields and various magnetic forces. Metals can be manipulated to levitate or moved in a manner similar to telekinesis and even limited flight can be done by using your own magnetism. As a side effect you generate powerful, electromagnetic pulses capable of shutting down electrical systems around yourself. Things such as manipulating the terrain of a construction site from easily a mile away on the roof of a city skyscraper, levitating multiple military tanks and jeeps, and extending your reaches to the outer edges of the atmosphere to grab hold of satellites are child’s play. Due note that you won’t be reaching the comic’s version of Magneto anytime soon."
400 CP,Telekinesis,X-Men Evolution,"Mind over matter as the saying goes. You have the ability to move objects with your mind. Using this you lift objects such as cars, trains, people, and even yourself to fly. You project a great force with your mind which includes such things as powerful shockwaves and force fields (strong enough to hold back the water flow of a broken dam or contain a massive train explosion). With training or time, you could juggle helicopters with ease and possibly even alter the shape of inorganic materials on the molecular level."
400 CP,Cryokinesis ,X-Men Evolution,"The power of ice is a formidable power once properly used. By manipulating thermal energy to create extreme cold you can freeze anything, create cold winds that freeze things within seconds, and more all while being immune to anything cold related. It’s not just all about freezing though as you can create snow to form barriers, bridges of ice, and other things. The ice you use can form a variety of things from tools, structures, constructs, and even a full-body armor that increases physical stats, but still allows free movement. Lastly since you freeze everything on the atomic level anything you touch with your ice can be made fragile."
500 CP,Prophet of the Underverse,Riddick,"You have seen beyond the threshold and into the Underverse but it did not change you, at least not mentally. You hold within yourself the powers that the current Necromonger Lord Marshal has, this grants you enhanced stamina, strength to lift 10 tons and an incredible boost to durability, enough to match a Furyans. Along with all of this you can detach your soul from your body for short bursts of super speed, your soul cannot be damaged by doing this but can interact with the physical world. However your body will follow slowly behind your soul during this time you must wait for your body to catch up with you before you move your body again. Although the speed it takes to reach your soul is only slow in comparison to the speed your soul can move at."
500 CP,Red Blast ,The Boys,"“Why isn’t she healing?” You are now capable of projecting a nuclear blast from your chest. Capable of controlling its intensity. At full power, the blast is potentially capable of bringing down a city, and even the likes of Homelander. Furthermore, it burns out the Compound V in the body of a Supe, making them a normal human. In future jumps, you can select a certain group of powered individuals (such as Kryptonians, Martians, Mutants, Inhumans, Dragons,etc.), this power has the same effect on them."
500 CP,Self-Duplication ,"The Incredibles","You can multiply like rabbits. More seriously, you have the ability to splitting up into up to five identical copies of yourself. Able to act independently, these copies share all your powers, memories, and even whatever you were wearing when you split yourself up. Once you’re done with whatever you needed the extra hands for, you can also quickly fuse back into a single body again."
500 CP,Controlled Radiation Bursts,"The Incredibles","The ability to create and control these bursts of radiation is now you. You control is extremely precise, allowing you to create low and high intensity bursts that might cause focused radiation burns to people, while leaving bystanders unharmed. But at your worst, when you really push yourself... you could complete disintegrate them. Your maximum range for high intensity bursts will top out at about a hundred meters, with a decidedly sharp intensity falloff beyond that distance."
500 CP,Not Quite the One ,The One,"You’re not the One—not quite—but you’re very close to it. For one reason or another, most versions of you in other universes of this jump have died, and their life energies have concentrated into you. You are stronger, faster, and smarter than a human could possibly reach of their own accord. You can run at fifty miles per hour, use short bursts of super speed where everything appears to go in slow motion, and are strong enough to deform steel with your bare hands... and survive attacks from someone capable of the same. Do make note, however, that despite being tougher than a normal human, this provides little protection against force focused on a small area, such as a bullet. There are only two versions of you still alive, including yourself; the other surviving “you” is fiat-backed to survive the next ten years, but is likewise guaranteed never to leave their home universe or try to kill you. This perk is incompatible with “The One” scenario. In future jumps which operate by different metaphysics, this simply serves as an increase to your abilities, and does not affect any duplicates you may or may not have in parallel universes, if other universes even exist in the jump in the first place."
600 CP,Mind of a Genius,All-Star Superman,"One part of the promise of tomorrow is the advancement of technology, pioneered by great geniuses like the good Dr. Quintum and the many minds working towards the betterment of mankind. Lex Luthor himself could be counted among these, had he focused his energies differently. You are what this world considers a 9th level intellect, able to hold nine simultaneous thought processes seamlessly. In addition, you find it laughably simple to innovate and advance technology, along with possessing an almost omnidisciplinary engineering ability. You could feasibly make things like shrinking devices, robots, artificial intelligence, teleporters, gravity-manipulating guns and even things as outlandish as a storytelling robot that tells literature at such a high speed and sound frequency that it could generate an escape tunnel. And those are just trinkets compared to what you may eventually make with time and resources - the mysteries of the universe are open to you. You just have to reach out and grasp them."
600 CP,Adaptability ,Justice League: Unlimited,"Your enemies will have to think of new tricks anytime they fight you.
Regardless of what it is you can't be beaten the same way twice. Get lobotomized by someone's laser
vision? So long as you can recover from it you'll always be able to shrug off such an attack whenever it
gets used against you again. Adaptations are permanent for the form you're in when you receive
them. Any adaptation you develop will protect you against similar levels of damage in roughly the
same area, so if Superman melted your brain with laser vision your skull would become immune to
energy attacks as strong or weaker than Superman's heat vision, and if you managed to regenerate
from a nuclear explosion your skin would harden to allow you to survive similar attacks in the future.
Also if you you were ever hi by something like a magical fireball then you'd be immune to both regular
and magical fire of the same strength or intensity as whatever spell you were hit by."
600 CP,Memory Absorption,Lexx,"You may take the skills, knowledge, and memories of any sentient being you personally kill.
The process requires a few seconds of concentration at the moment of death and only works
on one person at a time. Memories taken this way do not influence you or alter your
personality."
600 CP,Synthetic Dawn ,Mass Effect - Jumpchain,"Fully reworked to emphasize nothing but your raw, undiluted destructive power, your body is an unimaginably potent artillery piece. Compared to even Subject Zero or an Asari Justicar - you are phenomenal in your biotic abilities. Generally speaking, it would take at least three or four of them, assuming each one was at least as strong as Samara fully leveled up in game along with supporting buffs from Shepard, working in concert to equal you. Your calorie concerns are even massively reduced, meaning you could comfortably use your powers at combat levels for hours, perhaps even days, without needing to stop and eat. The only downside is you’re now an inhuman biotic god with powers beyond that of any other living being. Consider this a significant step towards becoming an energy based being."
600 CP,Subject Zero,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Through experiments done to you, either willingly or not, you are the absolute peak of biotic potential amongst your race. Any supernatural ability you possess, be it biotics or actual magic, is now 20% more effective and much less strenuous to use than before. Let them look upon you and weep, for they know they can never measure up to your power."
600 CP,Anti-Life Immunity ,Superman - The Animated Series,"The most fearsome and terrible power in the universe, the Anti-Life Equation has the power to completely dominate the minds of any and all sentient beings. Except for you. You now have complete and total immunity to anything and everything that would artificially influence or control your mind, body, or soul. This includes mundane things like drugs and supernatural things like telepathy but it has no effect on things that naturally influence you like rhetoric or guilt."
600 CP,Made It To 8th Ed.,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"Your existence cannot be erased, not by reality warpers, time-travelers, malevolent writers. Nothing and no one can deny that you are real, and you matter. So go forth, and fear no darkness."
600 CP,Power Absorption ,X-Men Evolution,"The mac daddy of the superpowers. Why have one superpower when you can have them all? Temporarily of course though. Like a certain Rogue, you too can gain the memories, skills, and powers of beings that you touch by absorbing their life force and weakening them, possibly into a coma if you aren't careful. Those that are stronger than you can resist this up to an extent although if they severely dwarf you in power then there is no absorption. You are able to select specific skills like dancing with a light touch but full on skin to skin contact will result in you getting the whole deal. Longer touching leads to longer usage of powers up to a 24 hour period. If you’ve gone beyond and absorbed a person’s life force to the point of their death then that power is permanently yours for the taking and it can even be improved beyond what the original owner was capable of."
600 CP,Destiny ,X-Men Evolution,"You can see into the future! Obligatory reference out the way you have the power of seeing events weeks, months, and even years before they happen. These visions aren't perfect however as they don't get every detail down but are an extremely accurate guideline for things to come. These visions can be strengthened by reducing the time that you see into the future. The dial can be set forth from seeing months or years into the future to merely seconds. A few days is the average point where you will perfectly experience things as they will always happen if you don't do anything."
