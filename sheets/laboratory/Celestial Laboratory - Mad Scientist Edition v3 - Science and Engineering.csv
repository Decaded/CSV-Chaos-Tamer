0 CP,Lingua-Technis,Warhammer 40K - Mechanicus,"You know the secret language of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and provided that you
have the correct equipment, you can both communicate in and understand the
bursts of binary that make this language. It is a very efficient form of
communication, capable of conveying vast amounts of information in a short
timeframe."
0 CP,Rust-B-Gone,Warhammer 40K - Mechanicus,"As stated by the Tech-Priest Jung, “Our enemies may rest but rust never sleeps.”
Rust is a perpetual threat to the Adeptus Mechanicus, one oft-overlooked in favor
of more immediate and grander problems. Yet, it is a foe you seem to have
vanquished. None of your possessions ever rust, tarnish, or suffer from similar
sorts of passive erosion. Any intentional attempt to make your equipment rust will
be as effective as it would normally be, but accidents and natural exposure?
Never."
0 CP,Tech-Adapting ,Gargoyles  ,"By spending a few moments examining a machine, you can figure out how it's most basic functions work. Driving vehicles you've never encountered and operating strange computers is never outside your ability. Longer times spent studying a device increases your understanding, obviously."
100 CP,Artificer,Warhammer 40k - Grey Knights,"As part of your extensive training with the Adeptus Mechanicus, you are now highly skilled in maintaining, repairing, and upgrading a wide array of advanced equipment used by the Imperium of Man. This includes weapons and armor critical to both the Imperial Guard and Astartes, such as Lasguns, Lascannons, Bolters, Chain Weapons, and Power Armor. Your expertise enables you to keep this equipment in peak condition, ensuring it functions reliably even in the harshest environments. Over time, you are capable of upgrading these items, slowly transforming them into masterwork Artificer-grade equipment. This means your weapons and armor won't just perform at their standard level but will gradually become more powerful, more efficient, and more durable."
100 CP,Artisan,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Unlike many in the machine cult who care not for appearances, your equipment and visible bionics are shelled with precious metals and etched with devotional symbols. Every object you craft or possess for a prolonged period of time acquires a bit of extra flair with no effort and without detriment to their functions. Though seen by many in the cult as wasteful or vain this attention to appearance can endear one to those in the higher ranks of Imperial society who value such affectations. You may choose to suppress this perk entirely or only for specific items."
100 CP,At Least You Should Do Them Properly,Bioshock 2,"The markets of Rapture may have been patient, but its science stood still for nothing. Advancements thought impossible on the surface were made in months instead of decades. All thanks to Andrew Ryan refusing to place any form of control on its practice. Similarly, you were freed of the leashes known as ethics and humanity as well. And you are loath to give up such freedom. Your ability to advance your understanding of science is greatly enhanced whenever you disregard petty hindrances like morality. Simply put, when people suffer for your science, you learn so much more "
100 CP,Attendants ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Choose: A dozen servo skulls, a five-servitor workforce, or a trio of personalized cherubs. All are dull but reliable servants, coming equipped for a variety of tasks. The patterns of each are easy to re-fit for more specialized work.
"
100 CP,Can’t Say I Didn’t Warn You,Flash Gordon,People actually trust your scientific expertise and tend to believe you absent a strong reason not to.
100 CP,Demolitions ,Star Wars – KOTOR,"You gain a natural affinity for explosives. You know everything there is to know about mines, bombs, and grenades. You can easily make and disarm explosives and any explosive weapon you use will deal slightly more damage."
100 CP,Fringe Scientist,Ghostbusters,"You’re as smart as a whip. Your intelligence makes you fully capable of winning the Nobel Prize for physics or mathematics if only those people in the scientific establishment were willing to believe you enough to try and repeat your experiments. This brilliant mind also allows you to design, modify, and build ghostbusting equipment, and otherwise bridge the gap between science and the paranormal."
100 CP,Highly Educated,Short Circuit ,"You are extremely well-educated. You have Doctorates in two related fields of your choice, with appropriate Masters and Bachelors degrees as well. These degrees will always be acknowledged in any future setting and will update to include the appropriate knowledge in such settings. This can be purchased multiple times, with each additional purchase being discounted to 50cp.
"
100 CP,Logical,Star Trek - Enterprise,"You have an excellent memory and great intellect, especially in inductive and deductive reasoning."
100 CP,MacGyver,Andromeda,"You are a natural at fixing and jury rigging things. As long as you have the parts and tools you can fix nearly anything. You also have the capability to build emergency equipment that can help to save your life and the lives of others, but these tend to be one offs given the time crunch you are usually under."
100 CP,Maker Affinity,Warhammer 40k - Grey Knights,"You have a preternatural connection to the concept of making. You rapidly improve in your use of tools and skills. No science or craft field is beyond you. In fact, you absorb the knowledge like a sponge. You may not have perfect memory, but you’re a walking data store of all arts, crafts, and science. Anything new you learn, you never forget. This Affinity endears you to possible romantic partners who fit the maker mold."
100 CP,Mechanical Basics,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"You know how to maintain and repair most common equipment of the day. And with that comes a decent knowledge of chemistry, physics and computer science. It’s the future after all, things are complex."
100 CP,Plowshares from Swords from Plowshares,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"You might have noticed most of the best Squat vehicles and weapons are repurposed mining and industrial equipment. This is no accident, for not only do such things have to be tough, they are intimately familiar to operators and engineers alike. You have a particular genius for weaponizing civilian technology, and finding constructive industrial uses for weapons."
100 CP,Real Rocket Scientist,Flash Gordon,"You understand the science of rocketry, and can do advanced calculus and trigonometry in your head the same way most people can do basic arithmetic."
100 CP,Rites of maintenance,"Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus
","While already designed to be incredibly robust, Imperial equipment inevitably requires maintenance. You can locate and identify problems within a machine in a fraction of the time it would take other adepts. Not knowing how a machine functions does not make fixing it any more difficult so long as you have the proper parts, tools, and rituals to guide your hands."
100 CP,Scientific Method,Star Trek - Enterprise,"Form theory, then testable hypothesis, test it in an experiment, then repeat and publish to avoid error. You are very good at recognizing your own biases or experimental errors that could prejudice your results, thus you are better at arriving at the truth through science."
100 CP,Speciality ,Stargate Atlantis,"Selected for your expertise in one relevant science, you hold at least one Masters degree and a PhD in related science topics of your choice. If you're not from Earth, it's the equivalent knowledge."
100 CP,Tech-Head ,Aliens vs Predator,"The hallmark of human ingenuity, electronic devices abound in the modern age, but without the know-how to operate them, they might as well be alien technology...or magical gifts from the gods. This level of skill is enough to know how to operate any human tech you might encounter in this jump at the most basic level, even if you just dropped in; it’s also packaged with just enough electrical know-how to manually patch a defective comm relay, override airlock safeties, hotwire a skimmer or run a bypass on a locked (but low security) door. This hotwiring
knowledge will function for any the at about the same level of technology or lower."
100 CP,Your Brain Will Not Know The Difference,Total Recall,"You are a fully trained ReKall technician.More than that, you are a fully trained neurologist, with a specialty in memory neurology, and electrical engineer, with a specialty in memory manipulation technology, and all the accreditations and documentation to prove your knowledge. You are also a true artist at programming new memories, blending them in perfectly with existing memories or perfectly replacing those memories entirely."
200 CP,Actually Reads the Data ,Star Trek - Enterprise,"How many times did Phlox scan someone, dismiss the idea anything was wrong, only to find the
problem hours or days later? You never have this problem, fully and completely understanding the contents of every scan, and with any strange anomalies jumping out to your attention."
200 CP,Black Boxing,Warhammer 40k -Squats,"While certain red-robed rats of Mars always trying to get their grubby mechadendrites on your stuff is annoying, messing with them is endlessly entertaining. You can easily tweak your work to be nearly impossible for others to duplicate. If you’re feeling particularly spiteful, you can build in some cross-connections so anyone trying will blow themselves up."
200 CP,Computers ,Star Wars - KOTOR,"Droids, networks, and personal computers are your playthings. You're an expert at manipulating and improving digital devices, and you can cut through most security systems like a lightsaber through butter."
200 CP,Fast Service,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"Some might wonder what place a mechanic has on the battlefield, but they clearly never saw a tank take a crippling hit. Fortunately, your skills are such that you can repair many vehicles and devices that would seem at first glance only good for parts, and in a fifth the normal time."
200 CP,Hardware ,Star Wars - KOTOR,"Gives you training in how to operate, repair and improve machines. You can easily rebuild broken droids from salvaged parts, and you'll even be able to fix starships given enough time and equipment."
200 CP,"Machines, They Just Speak To Me ",Firefly,"You have no formal schooling, but can fine-tune and repair engines with nothing but shoe polish. You don't know what the parts are SUPPOSED to do, but you know how to make them work the way you want. You can diagnose a faulty part in the power core just by listening to the AC cycle, and can fix pretty much anything with naught but a wrench and some duct tape. It may not be pretty, and it may not last long, but it'll work.
"
200 CP,Machinist,Gargoyles  ,"You are an expert mechanic. You can rebuild and improve a helicopter in 12 hours or create a functional motorcycle from spare parts. If honed, this ability will let you make nearly anything from incredibly advanced robots to nanite swarms in only a few months time."
200 CP,Make Do ,Flash Gordon,"Any way you slice it, building a functioning rocket, on your own, is unimaginably impressive. Macgyver could only stare in naked envy at your ability to force regular materials to do things and endure strains they were never meant to, and to work under pressure."
200 CP,Mechanic ,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"Just about everyone know how to tune up a cranky repulsorlift or clean the filters on a moisture vaporator, but it’s another thing entirely when the hyperdrive gives up the ghost and you’re adrift in deep space with just a toolkit and some spare parts. You know how to fix the systems on a starship well as any period astromech droid. As a plus, you know the ins and outs of common technology in this galaxy well enough to build a repulsorlift or fusion plant in your sleep."
200 CP,Polymath,OOC - Dr Doom,"You have a very special talent for melding different branches of science into new, powerful
forms. Examples include mixing mechanics and psychology into a hypnotic machine, mixing
biology and engineering to make plants with mechanical traits. Skies the limit."
200 CP,Technical knock,"Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus
","You have mastered the ancient technical rite of 'if it doesn't work, smack it with a wrench until it does.' Small problems like loose gears can be quickly and permanently fixed with one good whack. When a larger problem impedes a machine's function, continuous pounding and irate prayer can cajole it to miraculously perform one last, brief task, but no more. At that point, this rite will have no more effect until the device receives proper attention."
200 CP,Saboteur,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition.,"People nowadays are very reliant on technology, and it's a weakness that you can exploit. You are a master of  iruses, causing debilitating bugs and glitches in all but the most secure systems. This is extremely useful when you realize that modern guns are effectively more computer parts than the mechanical pieces of the twenty-first century."
200 CP,Skull of Elder Nikola ,Warhammer 40k - Imperium of Man,"An ancient relic, this skull once belonged to an ancient human who lived during the early days of mankind. Should the correct praise-psalm be sung to it, the skull will emit a halo of electric power that expands outwards, scrambling the circuits of enemy war machines."
200 CP,Transportation Tech,Last of the Omega Lords,"You are capable of making sense of technology related to transportation. You can more easily grasp sciences and fields of studies related to things like speed, movement, and transportation, including but far from limited to teleportation."
200 CP,Unusual Specialization ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1,"There are fields of knowledge and advancement that a person is renowned for, and it's usually for a reason. You are now one of those people, a leading expert in something that the world looks to when they have questions regarding it. Whether this is Gamma Radiation, or Wormhole Physics, or Modular Design, or any one field of knowledge you deem fit so long as it would fit in this world. You may take this perk multiple times if you wish.
"
200 CP,You Have to Use Your Hands? ,Back to the Future,"You’re accustomed to the wonders of the 21st Century, and while you couldn’t necessarily whip up a Mr. Fusion by yourself, when it comes to simple future-tech like holograms, computers, or hovercraft you are something else. You’re extremely good at computer programming and hacking as well."
300 CP,Alchemy ,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"During this period, the creation of devices that harness the Force, as well as the imbuement of the Force into both inanimate and living matter is well established. The Rakatans use Force for device power, for navigation, for hyperspace travel, for construction, and for weaponry. The Je’daii use the force in tempering special blades, in transforming beasts for use, for transforming people (though that is frowned on,) and for many other things not specified. Now, you have that same talent. You know how to make the force artefacts of your side, can easily learn the skills of the other side, and with effort you can design new devices of your own, or even learn to imbue other mystic powers you have access to into items."
300 CP,Cyberneticist ,Star Wars - Clone Wars,Your a master at making artificial limbs and organs. You could easily create replacement parts indistinguishable from their originals or save someone from the brink of death by transforming them into a monstrous cyborg similar to General Grievous. You also know how to augment people in ways that won't diminish any supernatural powers or abilities they may possess.
300 CP,Plasmids Are The Paint,Bioshock 2,"ADAM flowed through every vein in Rapture to some degree. Plasmids were a force that could sway the entire economy with each new formula released. Suchong and Tenenbaum were certainly the two spearheading development, but they were not the only ones. There was an entire field of geneticists tinkering in their labs on how best to mix the human genome like a cocktail. You were one of these minds. You have a decade of practical experience playing and modifying genetics, but are particularly skilled when it comes to creating Plasmids and Tonics. While you are by no means a world-changing genius like the two greats previously mentioned, you are more than capable of creating your own ADAM-based products given a lab and supply of the substance. What you do with this knowledge is entirely up to you."
300 CP,Test Subjects ,Spider-Man Trilogy,"When you are performing genetic engineering, armour or weapons testing, or other scientific experiments it can sometimes be hard to find people willing to test them. Not anymore! This application form allows you to always find willing subjects, just fill out the form to specify a few categories for the sort of test subjects you want and generic 'people’ will arrive the next day, ready for testing. They're nothing special, but you'll never run out of volunteers, and nothing will ever come of them going missing, almost as if they didn't exist before arriving at your lab. You'll never need to run tests on yourself with this never ending stack of forms."
300 CP,Xeno-Archaeologist ,Warhammer 40k -Squats,"Let the tech-priests wring their hands over tech-heresy, you know that all xenos and archaeotech works on sound physical principles. They worked before, and can be made to work again. You are a master of figuring out and reverse engineering technology, taking less than a tenth the time it would take a Guild workshop, and about a millionth the time it would take the AdMech."
400 CP,Archmagos ,Warhammer 40k - Imperium of Man,"You have spent centuries researching the ways of the Omnissiah, and have become a true master of technology. Though your understanding of the Imperium’s technology is vast, you truly shine within a certain field. Perhaps you’re a master of weaponry, though you could easily turn it towards a more biological field. The more narrow your chosen field is, the better at it you’ll be. This option may be taken multiple times."
400 CP,Barrel of Jokaero,Warhammer 40k - Minor Xenos,"I’m pretty sure this would be demeaning for any other species, but alas. You have a replenishing supply of Jokaero within this barrel, able to supply any of your technological needs before returning to their refuge. If you somehow lose this container of technologically advanced primates, it will show up in your warehouse the next day good as new."
400 CP,Binaric Weaving,"Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus
","The skills gained during long years plumbing data-vaults as a humble logistican have only improved over time. You excel at writing code, understanding machine-script better than native grammar structures. You can understand simple programs with a mere glance and correct any errors you find within seconds, and scrutinizing longer lines of more complex coding for a single misplaced byte can take mere minutes with your skills. Scrapcode crashes ineffectually against your data-barriers, its transmission doing nothing but opening the offending heretek's systems to a counter-intrusion. Interfacing with a system infested with a daemon or true AI would be unwise, but with your skills emerging unscathed from such an encounter is only highly unlikely rather than completely impossible.
"
400 CP,Chief Mechanic,Star Wars Squadrons v1.1,"You have the necessary knowledge and skill required to maintain, repair, and refit all of the starships found in the starships section. While maintaining a squadron of starfighters is a job that you will be able to manage by yourself, larger vessel like capital ships may require you to instead head a team of engineers, due to the practical issue of only being at a single location at once, and only having so much time in which to get things done. Using the expertise granted by this perk as a base, it wouldn’t be difficult for you to learn to take care of similar kinds of starships in the same manner."
400 CP,Droid Repair,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"You are a mechanical maestro, creating custom robotic creations and pushing existing droids far past their usual lifetime and capabilities. Whether you’re creating cutting-edge assassins or prim and proper protocol droids, there are few, if any, who can match your skill."
400 CP,G.E.C.K.,Fallout Mutants,"Few creations of mankind are as wonderful as the Garden of Eden Creation Kit, a device capable of bringing life to even the most irradiated and barren of places. Using soil and seed supplements, water purifiers, atmospheric chemical stabilizers, cold-fusion generator, and matter-energy replicators, you could bring about a paradise on earth. You can only use this once per month to affect an area roughly
fifteen square miles."
400 CP,Honor the Machine Spirit,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes,"Apothecaries tend to the bodies of the dead, Chaplains to their spirits. Techmarines tend to the spirits of the Machine. You are a skilled salvager. For example, while others might see a destroyed tank, you can see a way to salvage usable parts, perhaps restoring another vehicle to fighting trim or finding a way to save unique weapon systems to be re-used another day. This also gives you a strong grounding in the Rites of Reverse Engineering, able to examine unknown technology and figure out basic functionality by comparing it to devices you are already familiar with. You also have a much broader definition of the word 'damaged', able to restore machinery that others would swear was inoperable or destroyed given enough time and as long as you have enough of the original damaged parts to work with.
"
400 CP,Jack of All Fields,Flash Gordon,"Learning in one field science deepens your understanding of other fields, as nothing is entire self-contained or unrelated. To begin with, this gives you an incredibly broad understanding of most sciences, why should being an astrophysicist stop you from understanding alien biology, after all."
400 CP,Lay Mechanic ,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes,"The Chapter's Techmarines are genius specialists, combining the mental prowess of a Space Marine with the training of the Priests of Mars. However, they are limited in number. You are trained to help take up the slack, and have been enlightened with some of their mysteries. You are capable of helping to maintain and, under their leadership, build the mighty vehicles of war that support the Chapter, from Rhinos to Land Raiders. You can also safely work upon the Chapter's mighty voidships, helping to maintain the fleet, and have a good practical grounding in the various technologies therein. It might not be the esoteric knowledge of a Techpriest or Techmarine, but you know how to keep that plasma reactor from going critical mid-battle, and that's just as important, no?
"
400 CP,Master Mechanic,Star Wars - The Force Unleashed,"Much like Jedi Master Kazdan Paratus you are a wizard when it comes to machines, easily building, repairing, and even designing new ones. The war droids you build would be able to kill Jedi and Sith should you have the resources, and even with subpar scrap as your only option you could construct terrifying technological nightmares capable of tearing through squads of Stormtroopers with ease. Other devices would be similarly brilliant should you put your mind to the task. Though with some tinkering and research you could certainly go further; the secrets of imbuing your machines with the Force and other “supernatural” energies is an avenue you’ll find yourself just as talented in."
400 CP,Modular Designs,Dead Space,"It's always easier to make better things from better materials, and your knowledge of far-future  engineering is top-notch, meaning that all of the things you make are all that much better for it. Aside from being able to upgrade parts, tools, and weapons further, and make better base parts for tools and weapons, you can apply the bonuses of Infinitely Customizable to things other than tools and weapons, breaking anything down into classes of modular parts and swapping them around to your heart's content. This nearly obviates every part of the process of retro-fitting older creations with newer parts, aside from the actual manual labor and time."
400 CP,Plagiarism,Back to the Future,"The ancient art of stealing other people’s hard work, and most profitable for a time-traveler. Given anyopportunity to take something apart and examine the workings you can reverse-engineer pretty much any form of technology, even if it’s a fusion reactor from another century or an anti-gravity drive that breaks the known laws of physics."
400 CP,Dormancy protocols,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Working with unknown technology can be dangerous, so you have inloaded an obscure set of technical protocols that allows you to isolate the individual functions of a machine. The most aggressive probing will never activate connected systems, no matter how closely interlinked. For example, the auspex and detonation systems of a fusion warhead. This includes security systems, which will not log an abnormality or raise an alarm so long as you return everything you examine to exactly the way you found it."
400 CP,Robotics Expert,Fallout 3,"Robots are so much easier to deal with than humans, much less complex. You have an instinctive understanding of robots, finding it easier to predict their movements or next actions. This also helps with building, repairing, or deactivating them, as you know just what they need to be in top form and beyond, or rendering them completely harmless. Hell, you could even build an entire Protectron blindfolded."
400 CP,Rocket Science,Futurama,"You understand the intricacies and mechanics of spaceship travel. You know precisely how to
make a Dark Matter Accelerator to create a vessel capable of moving the universe around it."
400 CP,Tech-Savvy,The Boys,"We live in the age of technology. Lucky for you, you have extensive knowledge about most things mechanical, especially computers. You are able to hack into almost any system and you aren’t so shabby with counter hacking and keeping your data trails hidden either."
400 CP,Technosorcery,Gargoyles  ,Combining magic and technology is a no brainer for you. You can handily blend the two to create amazing effects like broadcasting spells over telephone lines or melding creatures together through sorcerous surgery. Very little in the field of technomagic is beyond your reach with this skill.
500 CP,Master Hacking,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition.,"The digital world is much less chaotic than the actual galaxy you live in, and with those hard rules there are clear ways to exploit it. You are a master hacker and programmer, easily able to hack all but the most heavily encrypted databases from the other side of the planet with a single outdated PC. Additionally, any programs you work on or code yourself will have no bugs or exploits in them."
600 CP,Code Wizard,Mass Effect Andromeda,"Some folks are good at surviving in the jungle, but you are the pro at conquering the Concrete Jungle! Or, well, whatever material your surroundings end up being constructed out of. Towards that end, you can get access to whatever local electronics and/or computer systems are around. Even a completely different programming language or hardware materials science is only a temporary speed bump to someone like you. You can quickly figure out what hardware does what for computer systems, and can interpret the coding language of the systems you encounter. Once you know how to say what you want, it's a simple step to figure out what to say to gain access to the system. SAM Connection: With an AI in your head to quickly handle all the brute work of figuring out the system, you can simply wave your hand to get a foreign technology to do what you want. You still need a bit of time for you and your head-buddy to figure out the system, but once you know the basics, the things you can achieve by just waving your hand at a computer is positively magical. Why, it's almost like technopath
"
600 CP,Comic Book Scientist ,The Boys,"You are a smart cookie, a genius. You can easily recreate almost any technology available in our world, with enough time and resources, you may recreate Compound V, perfect cloning technology, create AIs, etc."
600 CP,Genius Level Intellect,X-Men - The Animated Series,"Many of Xavier’s students possess above average intellect, however you are in the same league as Hank McCoy. Your ability to come up with ideas and invent is nearly unparalleled, and actually building your inventions is child’s play. What’s more, your inventions have a lot more room in terms of following conventional physics; you can create things like inhibition collars, invisible jets, Cerebros and much, much more."
600 CP,Greatest Mind,OOC - Dr Doom,"What kind of scientist would you be if not for a vorpal sharp mind? You can accomplish things
those in your original world would consider impossible and bend the rules of the universe to
serve JUMPER. Spaceships that can be anywhere in an instant. Weapons that could shatter the
world with just their start up. The power is terrifying."
600 CP,Guildmaster,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"You have risen through the ranks to become the seniormost Engineer’s Guild member in a Stronghold. There is nothing about Squat or Imperial technology you do not understand in detail, and you’re brilliant at adapting the principles of one device to another. You’d stand a good chance of fixing the Golden Throne, if they’d ever let a filthy abhuman into the Imperial Presence."
600 CP,Inventor,Futurama,"You are a brilliant (if eccentric) Inventor. You can (within reason) create nearly anything you can
imagine if you put in the time. You have a cabinet full of doomsday devices and would be more than capable of slapping together Reverse Scuba Suits for fish or Death Clocks."
600 CP,Jules Verne,Back to the Future,"An inventor does not thrive merely by copying others. You need to have the imagination to visualize new ways of doing things and the engineering skills to actually make those things a reality. Your sheer scientific talent matches the likes of Emmett Brown, while your imagination is equal to that of Jules Verne, who envisioned phones, submarines, automobiles, helicopters, space travel, video calls, news programs, tasers and solar sails over a century before they became possible. Hell, in several cases we’re still waiting to see if they ever become a thing. Such is your imagination and talent that very little exists that you cannot eventually build. Time machines, flying cars, shrinking rays... if it exists in sci-fi, you’ll get there."
600 CP,Master Mechanic,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Seems like Chewie gots some competition now. You’re a mechanic unparalleled throughout most of the galaxy. Gears, electronics, and machines of all kinds flow together under your careful hands. Delicate electronics and flying rust buckets easily disassembled and rebuilt better than the factory fresh models are your bread and butter, making you an invaluable member of any organization and crew. You might not be much for designing new ships just yet, but you have a knack for upgrades and improvements on existing technology and can make steady improvements on technology in your hands as new ideas flow into your mind."
600 CP,Mechancius outpost Jump-Kappa,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"An airlock connects your warehouse to a Mechanicus outpost orbiting a storm-wracked world and illuminated by a turbulent star. The handful of tech-priests and their servitor workforce are at your service, happy to study or reverse-engineer anything you bring them. The outpost is not equipped for mass-production or the construction of anything as large or complex as a titan, but the adepts can still forge a wide variety of STC designs. They'll work at a slow but steady pace unless you can provide them with extra materials, and they can make use of other warehouse  ttachments to produce larger and more varied items. You do not need to keep your warehouse open for the tech- priests to perform their work. The adepts are not and cannot become companions, but they share  any perks you possess that relate to scientific knowledge, performing research, the refining of materials and forging of items."
600 CP,Miracle Maker ,Short Circuit ,"You are the kind of inventing genius that can advance the state of the art by decades. You could build working, combat-capable robots with practical anti-tank laser weaponry from a base of typical 1980’s technology. Even better, you will often find that your inventions can exceed the limits of your design, if given a bit of a push. For example, a bolt of lightning could turn one of those robots into a true Digital Intelligence. Lucky accidents like that will show up on a frequent basis, though the better your initial design, the more they will benefit. Or you can choose to forgo this possibility for miracles to instead ensure that your designs and inventions have no unnoticed flaws or weaknesses, being created fully at the limits of your skill and knowledge. They will also have a bit of good luck, ensuring they are never damaged or destroyed by accidents or random occurrence. This can be purchased twice for both effects.
"
600 CP,Never Underestimate the Power of Computers ,Superman Jumpchain,"Nor the power of... well, you. You are a complete and utter savant, a shining genius in the field of computer design and operation. Not only is your talent at hacking and network manipulation such that you could have whole corporations at your mercy twenty minutes after meeting a computer connected to them, you have the design chops to build stupidly, unbelievably advanced computers yourself. In future jumps too, your knowledge of computer software and hardware updates itself to the latest languages and design philosophies, ensuring that you’re always capable of designing wonders such as what you can build here."
600 CP,Forged in eternity,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"The most potent and venerated relics wielded by Imperial forces are often the most ancient, artifice beyond what modern adepts can construct...but you are no common adept. What you craft is eternal, never to decay or malfunction from the passage of ages or the most strenuous use. Fate itself seems to conspire that your works are never permanently destroyed unless someone puts forth a dedicated effort to do so. If one of your creations are sundered yet then repaired by someone with sufficient skill, it will be restored to perfect functionality as if it had never been broken at all."
600 CP,Spirits in the Machine,Warhammer 40k - Imperium of Man,"Some may scoff at the idea of Machine Spirits, seeing them as nothing more but figments of a superstitious mind. You know better, as you possess an undeniable connection to these spirits. In any piece of technology, you can manifest Machine Spirits, spiritual entities that will improve the machine’s natural capabilities as well as their durability. Not only that, but they will be rendered highly resistant to both physical and spiritual corruption."
600 CP,Supreme Lord of All Scientists,Flash Gordon,"You’d think visiting a world a thousand years more advanced than your own would pose some problems, but no. In a matter of hours you can productively be doing cutting edge research in the labs of advanced aliens, and in a matter of days you could be teaching them things they didn’t know their technology could accomplish. You could be on a crashing rocket or falling sky-city and invent a new, superior form of levitation technology on the way down."
600 CP,Techno Enclave,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"The First Order didn’t have the numbers or the ideology to rule the galaxy, so how’d they get everyone to listen? Simple. They held a gun to the head of the universe. The technical genius that made the First Order the threat that they are is now yours to claim. You can replicate their greatest accomplishments, from starfighters to superweapons. Everything from miniaturized Death Star tech to cloning research is well within your reach. The shining light of your intellect will illuminate the galaxy... or perhaps burn it to ash."
600 CP,The Great Protectors ,Bioshock 2,"When Rapture sent up the call desiring creations to care for the city so the populous wouldn’t have to, Suchong answered with the Big Daddies. Bouncer models were made to drill rocks and help the city expand while Rosies were given a rivet gun to repair panels and windows. Both were genetically enhanced humans who had their skin and organs physically grafted into their armored suit. Their voice box was also removed for obvious reasons. Now, whether through chance or deliberate scientific espionage, you have discovered the plans, process, and Plasmids necessary to turn an ordinary person into a Big Daddy. You will have to come up with the materials, and the “willing” subjects, yourself, but given both and time you will be able to create them by the dozen. Given a little experimentation and a subject to examine, you might even be able to reproduce the legendary Alpha Series Protectors as well. Though, expect to have trouble controlling those beasts unless you come up with a method to do so."
600 CP,The Mind ,Megamind,"Ah, the good stuff. You arrive from the same planet from Megamind unless you don't. Either way, just like him you are a grade-A, five star genius on a comic book level, unmatchable and brilliant by all. Not only can you create things like invisible vehicles, death rays lasers and illusion generators, you are also a genius of the equal degree in all other fields, finding it just as easy to bioengineer a fish into sapience as to build a huge robot. Moreover, you can do all this on your typical city-level mostly unsuccessful villain's resources. You can get by with even the most limited or inferior resources, even if you might end up making wheels out of bent license plates now and then. You're particularly good at making tech that interacts with superpowers, be it replicating them, recreating them with samples from the holder, or boosting, weakening or even disabling them.

800 CP,Forgemaster,X-Men - The Animated Series,"Like the mutant Forge you have been blessed with the power to invent ‘anything you can think of’. This power has more limits than that, Forge often reminds us that Tony Stark was a better weapons designer than he was, and there are many other characters in these comics whose inventions he cannot replicate (without going into ones who were villains from other series such as Doctor Doom). Still you possess an intuitive skill with technology, granting you a mastery of reverse engineering and invention, able to create such inventions as a gun that neutralizes a mutant’s powers permanently, a battle simulator capable of projecting hard light holograms, or a version of Cerebro capable of being used without telepathic powers. Importantly this power seems to soften physics for your inventions, helping you invent what should be slightly impossible. With the right other boosts to your intelligence and skills you could equal or surpass Tony Stark. In this jump Genius Level Intellect+Forgemaster makes you his equal at least, and a potential match for Doom and Richards at most."
800 CP,I've Modified it to Handle Their Unique Frequency,Ghostbusters,"There’s an order to the universe; Matter is energy, energy cannot be destroyed. This is the fundamental scientific principle of modern ghost busting. As such, by analyzing the energy patterns of any divine, spiritual, demonic, spectral, etc. entity you’re able to modify and recalibrate your ghost busting equipment to handle it. In the worst-case scenario for the most powerful and fearsome beings you will face, you might have to go all out and devise and construct some seriously heavy equipment to handle the job of zapping and trapping them. But even that can be done in a matter of hours with your level of skill. Now go show those spooks who’s in charge!"
