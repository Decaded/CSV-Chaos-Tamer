0 CP,Omni-Tool,Shepard Quest,"This is a standard Omni-tool, a wrist-worn multifunction device. It can provide communications, scans, translations, small-scale basic fabrication, general computation, and device interface as well as combat abilities like EWAR, combat fabrication, and energy blasts. It has enough computing capability to run a “VI” Assistant while still running other apps at full speed. Yours also auto-upgrades to keep up with the best Paragon Industries omni-tools."
0 CP,Restraining Bolt and Caller ,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"This remote control-like device is named a caller, it can produce small, cylindrical devices named Restraining Bolts that respond to signals produced by the caller. When a Restraining Bolt is affixed to a droid it will limit its functions and enforce its obedience. When inserted, a Restraining Bolt restricts the droid from any movement its master did not desire.
"
0 CP,Dataslate,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"This dataslate functions much like you would expect it, being able to store large amounts of data as well as possessing a touch screen. Not only can it connect to any local extranet, but it has downloaded the complete Citadel Codex, the history of this Cycle as presented by the races considered a part of the Citadel."
100 CP,Motion Tracker ,Aliens vs Predator,"A handheld motion tracking unit which uses ultrasonic doppler pulses to trace nearby
movement through air motion. It has a top range in open terrain (optimal conditions) of 1000m,
but inside its max range is only around 20m. Just mind you don’t shoot any friendlies by
mistake. This unit’s nice and light to carry."
100 CP,Hair Nanites,Andromeda,"You have nanotechnology in your hair that allows you to change your hair color at will, and you could also use it to store massive amounts of data covertly. This gives you one dose for yourself and schematics to build more."
100 CP,Power Suppression Collar,Deadpool,"Ah, the old ""make 'em powerless"" trick. This Power Suppression Collar is just like the ones they used in The Ice Box to shut down mutant powers. You slap this bad boy on any superhuman or mutant, and BAM—no more powers. It’s like an ""off"" switch for heroes. You can use it to keep those pesky goody-two-shoes under control, or just laugh as they struggle to take it off. It’s not coming off easy, trust me."
100 CP,Perception Filter Key,Doctor Who,"A key from the TARDIS, this tiny little things has been modified to extend a Perception Filter all around the wearer. A perception filter is a field that, as the name suggests, filters you from people’s perceptions. Unless someone is deliberately looking for you, or you do something to attract attention, you find that people simply don’t care about you all that much. Their eyes pass right over you, dismissing you as part of the scenery. Could be useful, this."
100 CP,Global,Earth Final Conflict,"A global comm, think a futuristic/alien cell phone, with a pull out screen for internet and video calls. Also includes a camera, GPS and a basic scanner. Reaches anywhere in the world, can’t be hacked
or traced, never runs out of power."

It can even play the radio."
100 CP,Neuralyzer​,MIB,"A device about the size of a cigar tube that emits a flash of light that erases the memories of the past minutes, hours, days, months, or years, depending on the chosen settings."
100 CP,Psi Scanner,Red Dwarf,"An auspex that lets the user analyse their surroundings and objects. This machine provides data
about them. May be unreliable at times and require rebooting."
100 CP,Invisibility Belt,Rick and Morty ,"A belt that turns you invisible by pushing the belt-buckle. Yeah, that’s it."
100 CP,Impression Amplifier,Something Unlimited,"You acquire a simple amplifier that can cause just enough of a chemical reaction in the brains of women (or men or even both if you prefer) to give you a bit of an edge, essentially causing them to see you in a slightly better light and to be slightly more attracted to you than they normally would. By
default, this amplifier will be attached to a mundane accessory like a watch, but it can be easily removed and implanted in any outfit you have."
100 CP,Octopus Arms,Spider- Man - The Animated Series,"This metal backpack has four tentacles with graspers attached. A metal circlet will allow you to control them as naturally as if they were your own arms, using nothing but your thoughts. With these, you could perform dangerous experiments at a safe distance, or, hypothetically, go on a crime spree with your four super strong and dangerous new limbs."
100 CP,Neural Suppressing Collar,Star Wars - Darth Bane,"Neural suppressing collars are rather self-explanatory devices. They prohibit higher cognitive functions. Unfortunately they struggle with the ineffable quality of will and often fail on subjects with near inhuman levels of it. They’re all but useless on powerful Force sensitives who can ‘power’ through the cognitive field and then disable the collar. This one is considerable more powerful. In fact, it also disables one’s psychic powers. Be they a Force user, a Psyker or a Psion user, it matters not a dot when this collar is placed around their necks. Only you may take this item off of someone, leaving them otherwise permanently powerless."
100 CP,Subspace Tracking Beacons,Stargate Atlantis,"Eight subspace beacons no bigger than a child’s hand, and available in many types from barbed ones for implanting into Runners to general sensors that react to the presence of specific types of targets. Comes with one person-portable modular scanner to track them. Has a ridiculously impressive range of tens of thousands of light years, but is susceptible to interference (and fibrillators)."
100 CP,VR Stasis Pod,Stargate Atlantis,"Puts a body into suspended animation while the mind is active in a real-time VR simulation. From the
inside, the VR can be indistinguishable from reality, provided those inside don't remember going in or
try to tax the system too badly. Comes with a free selection of preset virtual environments plus
instructions for more."
100 CP,Grappling Hook,The Mandolorian,A staple for bounty hunters and people that need to climb things a small gun that shoots a bolt or bulb connected to a long cord that stick to or wrap around anything they hit allowing the holder to scale a wall or drag a target to themselves
100 CP,Plasma Cutter,"Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus","Easily used by hand or mechadendrite, this humble piece of archaeotech excels at the simple task it
was designed for - cutting and welding metals of almost any type and thickness, from thin wiring to
adamantium plating. It can be used as a deadly weapon in an emergency, but is awkward and
unsuited to such a role. It never seems to run out of fuel."
100 CP,Camo Cloak ,Warhammer 40k - Guardsmen Jump,"The Camo Cloak, also known as Cameleoline Cloak, is a cloak that is coated with a refractive
chemical substance that morphically blends its colouration into the surrounding area to hide its
wearer both from normal vision and thermal scans. The cameleoline is often woven into cloaks and
smocks, or more rarely utilized, as a coating over armour plate (you can use this item to upgrade
your armour to have all these functions). Its properties aid concealment during covert operations.
Unlike the standard variant used by various forces in the Imperium, this cloak provides a limited
radiation resistance and exceptional insulation against electrical attacks, halving their strength. This
CP backed cloak has mesh underlay that provides better protection to its wearer than a Flak Armour."
100 CP,Mimic Beacon,XCOM - Enemy Unknown,"Essentially a small speaker programmed with the same auditory cues aliens have been using in the field. Can be used to lure the invaders to an area, but is unlikely to work twice in a fight, or on aliens already engaged in combat. In future Jumps this becomes a similar lure to a chosen enemy type."
100 CP,Privacy Field Generator,Imperium Nihilus ,"The right to privacy is a right that Inquisitors violate all the time in their quest to track and bring down whatever threatens the sanctity and stability of the Imperium. But even they know that privacy has its time and place in the galaxy. Taken from the reliquary of an executed crime lord, this disc-shaped device—small enough to fit in your hand—can, at the push of a button, generate a dome of shimmering blue light with a ten-foot radius. Anything within cannot be seen nor be eavesdropped upon through purely material means, including devices such as vox- thieves or micro-beads. But it does not offer any protection beyond making it harder for your foes to see you."
100 CP,High-Tech Restraints,The One,"A set of restraints with a digital lock, such as those used by the MVA. They’re made of tough stuff, designed to restrain even people with super strength without suffering any damage. Only people with the correct authorization are capable of opening these locks, as they are unable to be hacked."
100 CP,F-Ray,Futurama,"More powerful than an X-Ray. Looks like a torch, allows you to see inside things (even metal). Strong enough to pop balloons.

100 CP,Lantean Detector,Stargate Atlantis,"Detects life signs and the energy signatures of active tech (and possibly energy beings and biotech), but doesn't distinguish between human and Wraith, or even human and replicator. Also useful for finding the nearest puddle jumper or Stargate if you’ve lost your way."

100 CP,Blacksun Filter ,Warhammer 40k - Freelancer,"Night vision goggles on steroids, gives unhindered sight at any illumination level, includes high-power zoom."
100 CP,Arc Thrower ,XCOM - Enemy Unknown,"This device functions on the basic premise of neurological disruption, emitting a focused electromagnetic pulse capable of confusing and incapacitating targets within a limited range. It's very likely that some aliens will resist the disabling effects of the weapon, in which case it might be more effective to weakenthe enemy first. The Arc Thrower is also constrained by our current power supply
technology, which limits its effectiveness to two shots per deployment"
100 CP,Valet Key,Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy,This is a universal valet key that opens any spaceship or vehicle and allows you to start the engines and take it for a spin.

150 CP,Stealth Boy,Fallout 4,"This is an experimental, rechargeable Stealth Boy that utilizes the same advanced technology that causes Chinese stealth suits to work nearly indefinitely. It works for around an hour; the same amount of time as a regular Stealth Boy, but is capable of recharging over a 24 hour period so that it can be used more than once. It also no longer causes harmful side effects due to prolonged use, making it much safer to use compared to a normal Stealth Boy."
150 CP,Gyrotemporal Vault ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines ","A fist-sized artifact in which a spindle of seemingly perpetual chrono-energy spins. With the correctly applied incantations, temporal energy can be siphoned from its midnight-black surface and projected outward to alter the flow of time, empowering your allies with a burst of incredible speed.
"
200 CP,Microwave Emitter ,Batman - Dark Knight Trilogy,The Wayne Enterprises 47B1 Microwave Emitter is an experimental weapon designed to vaporise large amounts of water using focused microwaves. If you used this on a cities water supply that had been infected with some chemical you could do some real damage.
200 CP,Intangibility Belt,Batman Beyond,"An extremely technologically advanced device that will allow you to control your own molecular density at will. With this device you can pass though any non-supernatural form of matter, allowing you to walk through walls, levitate, and be completely immune to physical attacks, however the belt can only ever be activated for about thirty minutes at a time before needing an hour to recharge."
200 CP,Mother Box ,Justice League: Unlimited,"An alien computer connected to the Source capable of interfacing with a wide array of machinery, projecting holographic images, providing information about topics known to the people of New Genesis or Apokolips, and creating portals between planets vast distances apart. This device is so advanced that it could reprogram a machine on par with Brainiac, but you have to directly attach the Mother Box to whatever it is you want it to interface with in order for it to work."
200 CP,Robot Detector Machine,Loki Jump,"Please confirm to your knowledge that you are not a fully robotic being, were born an organic creature and do in fact possess what many cultures would call a soul. Not sure? Would you like to test this? This archway will scan anything passing through it, determine the nature of the being, presence of features such as a soul, and create a printout of their temporal aura. By default, this device will also proceed to melt the being from the inside out if it is a robot, but your version can switch this feature off if desired. If you wanted to weed out robotic duplicates, Life Model Decoys and other cybernetic infiltrators this might come in handy. Just be prepared to clear up the mess."
200 CP,Submanifold casting stone,Star Trek - Lower Decks,"A submanifold casting stone is a type of rock that allows its users to broadcast their voices over
interstellar distances to other planets, and hear the response in turn."

"
200 CP,Electronic Lock Breaker,Star Wars- New Jedi Order,"You might call this tiny device a key to any door, with it’s sophisticated hacking mechanisms and a magnetic system for latches. I don’t know how it even manages with the living creatures of the
Yuuzhan Vong, but assume any door you slap this device and key your password into will open."

200 CP,Personal Tellyporta ,Warhammer 40k - Freelancer,"If the user sustains an injury, this device will activate and instantly teleport the user up to 1 mile away. It will only teleport the user onto safe ground, but beyond that the results are anyone’s guess."
200 CP,Brazier of the Eternal Flame,Warhammer 40k: Imperium of Man,"This relic of the Ecclesiarchy burns above the faithful, its blazing light driving back the darkness and protecting the true servants of the God-Emperor from sorcery. This effect may be extended to all those who fight alongside you, even if they have strayed from the Emperor’s light."
200 CP,Image Inducer ,X-Men Evolution,This wrist mounted device created by Charles not only is a clock but allows the wearer to form a holographic projection over themselves. As long as it is vaguely human shaped there’s not much that it can’t show or change into. The range is limited to a few feet around the users body so nothing too outlandish can be taken but you have some leeway.
200 CP,Clonefield,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"A specialized device that projects dozens of holographic duplicates, all moving in perfect synchronicity with you. Few foes have the perception, or the time, to pick out the real threat among all the false ones."
200 CP,Eyes of Kurnous ,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"Crystals said to be the eyes of the hunter god Kurnous, turned to crystal, pulled from his skull and dashed by a horrific Slaanesh who objected to being seen in their horrific totality. These shards sharpen the sense allowing one to see further, hear more, and revealing that which would otherwise be invisible."
200 CP,Dehumanizer ,Flash Gordon,"A brainwashing machine, the target must be restrained, but then their memories can be erased and replaced with a preprogrammed set, granting a variety of skills and every reason to be fanatically loyal to the user. May sometimes fail on the exceptionally strong-willed. May be repurposed into a teaching device, but who would ever trust you to use it only for that?"
200 CP,Utility Belt ,Legion of Superheros,"Never leave the house without it. This is a vigilante's best friend. An iconic storage device that allows you to carry all your equipment and gadgets. Which comes with Batman’s most used gadgets, and a shark repellent spray."
200 CP,Utility Mods,Dead Space,"Ah, technology, the best part of the future. The Kinesis Module projects an artificial gravity field from an emitter pad on the palm of the hand it's mounted on. Much like the name might imply, this field allows you to lift objects; smaller objects hover about a foot in front of your palm, whereas larger objects, most of which must be specifically modified to work with it and are typically on tracks or rails, move as close to you as they are able. You can manipulate these objects with your hand, and even throw them with a surprising amount of force, enough to penetrate a body with a bone spike and nail it to a steel wall. Stasis, on the other hand, as its name might imply, creates a temporal stasis field of a certain volume around the targeted object. It affects both organic and inorganic material, including living creatures, and has no problem with irregularly-shaped objects, flowing out around the targeted object."
250 CP,Bio-metric Cut Outs,Firefly,"You have a very fancy set of spectacles. They look slightly creepy, and have an uncomfortable red tint. On the other hand, that’s not what you use them for; they’re actually a complicated set of devices that interfere with most biometric scanning and monitoring technology. Retinal scans fail, your biometric signature is that of a random stranger, and even on-the-spot DNA testing won’t reveal your true identity. Also, they blur most images of your face on camera. However, evidence tested elsewhere (such as DNA left at the scene of a crime) will still match, so they'll only prevent pursuit for so long..."
300 CP,Neutron Bomb,Batman - Dark Knight Trilogy,"This began as a Wayne Enterprises fusion reactor however it had the issue of being easily weaponized. Which this one has been, giving it a five-kiloton yield that could take out an entire city. Careful where you use this."
300 CP,Tavlek Gauntlet,Farscape,"This powerful weapon can shoot energy blasts of varying strength, create an energy shield, and pumps you full of chemicals that make you stronger, faster, and heal quicker. Unfortunately these chemicals increase aggression, are highly addictive, and fuel the weapon so you probably shouldn't use it too often. This gauntlet refills itself once a day."
300 CP,Molecular Destabilizer ,Red Dwarf,A gun that will make solid objects and surfaces act as if they are not there for a very short period of time (top limit of 10 seconds).
300 CP,Mindshackle Scarabs,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","A specialized, smaller form of the Scarab designed to control the lesser species, it buries into the victim’s minds to bypass cerebral functions, effectively turning them into a puppet under your control.

"
300 CP,Stormcaller Stave,Imperium Nihilus ,"Nestled deep within the Segmentum Solar, the Hive World of Necromunda serves as one of the most industrious planets within the Imperium, even when compared by the standards of the Forge Worlds. There are few regiments of the Imperial Guard who have not had the honor of laying their hands upon the works of Necromunda. But for as many weapons of war are produced by the countless factories within the hive cities of the world, there are an equal number of riches and archaeotech relics hidden within the vast and labyrinthian hives and wastelands covering the surface of the planet. The Stormcaller Stave is one such relic. Most often utilized by the shamanic Wy’tari of Necromunda’s Ash Waste Nomads, this stave is responsible for their ability to conjure up and control the dust storms that plague the wastes beyond the hive cities of Necromunda. And now, so can you. With this staff in hand, you will be able to conjure up storms of your own, storms of ash and dust, of thunder and rain, storms that can encompass an entire village in seconds at best and minutes at worst. Finally, should you possess psychic powers, the storms you conjure can become far greater, enveloping cities in their entirety, and even making them unnatural. Something like a rain of fire or a storm of blood is not out of the question."
300 CP,Motherbox ,DC Universe,"A small highly advanced living computer from New Genesis. Capable of scanning and copying sources of information such as books, computers, and even the internet allowing for later viewing of the information. If the user is severely injured it can offer short term medical care to prevent death. It is extremely loyal to you."
300 CP,Invisibility Screen,Flash Gordon,"A cloaking device, this can apply invisibility to an area, hiding a few dozen people in a field for instance, or conceal entire community or rocket ship."
400 CP,Minbari Gravitation Ring,Babylon 5,"An incredibly rare, valuable and dangerous artefact, this small type of device can be worn on the finger like a regular ring. The device can increase local gravity at least five or six times for up to fifteen seconds. It wont allow you to fly since it can't affect anything bigger than a two foot by two foot square, but then again, having a dangerous opponent incapacitated during a fight because his lungs and heart are suddenly inside a zone of hypergravity can be a lifesaver. If the ring is damaged don't expect the Minbari to repair it for you, and get used to the incredibly long charging times, up to two days after a full fifteen second burst."
400 CP,Power Disruptor ,Justice League: Unlimited,"An extremely powerful device that can temporarily remove superhuman abilities. Aliens, metahumans, super-tech, and magical demigods are all vulnerable to the effects of this device and anyone hit with it will completely lose all of their superhuman abilities for several weeks. You could use this weapon to depower the entire Justice League if you wished. Pretty much the only things that won’t be affected by this weapon are creatures with powers comparable to gods."
400 CP,Key ,Lexx,"Inside your body there is a semi-living energy field, similar to the Key to the Lexx. With a
touch, you may attune anything you own to this Key. Anything attuned to this Key cannot be
used by anybody except you without your explicit say-so, which you may explicitly revoke at
any time. Guns will refuse to fire, vehicles will fail to start, doors won’t open, etc. There is no
limit to the number of things you may attune this Key to, though you do need to actually own
it. Any fiat purchased items are attuned to your Key automatically."
400 CP,Anti-Kaylon Device,Orville,"This peculiar device is a weapon that can easily wipe out the Kaylon. It functions by targeting the Kaylon’s synchronization matrix, allowing the safe destruction of the Kaylon with a sufficient power source. A large quantum reactor can enable the device to destroy all Kaylon’s in a 1,000 light year range. However, this device is even more peculiar because it allows the total destruction of any mechanical entity. Do you want to destroy the T-1000s and Skynet from Terminator? No problem, hook the device up to a powerful energy source and fire it up. It can also selectively target different machine entities, such as destroying the Borg, but leaving the Androids like Data unharmed. It can even differentiate between mechanical individuals that you want to selectively destroy, such as the Borg Queen, although you will require detailed scans of the Borg Queen to destroy her only and vice versa. With this device you, a mere meat bag, holds the sword of Damocles over all the races of machine nature. Furthermore, it will return to you if lost or destroyed in one month, and you have
blueprints to create more."
400 CP,Transdimensional Beamer ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","Normally used to get rid of debris or failed experiments, this weapon quite simply shifts the target into another dimension. Without Necron technology, there is no method of returning from this dimension, essentially making it a death sentence.
"
400 CP,Power Chair,Halo - The Covenant,"The floating chair, as it was, has no protective systems. This is entirely unacceptable for one such as yourself. That this may be mended, you have been given a copy of the Chair used by the Holy prophet of Regret- a chair that is not only capable of floating around, but that is capable of using its shielding system to protect it from sustained small arms fire. In addition, it can briefly teleport short distances to avoid combat, and can use its laser focus beam to burn away any heretics that would dare attack such a holy being as yourself."
400 CP,Timesplinter Cloak,Warhammer 40K - Mechanicus,"A defensive tool of the Chronomantic discipline, this cloak encases you in shards of crystallized time; each of these splinters will completely stop any attack not landed during the split-second formed in another moment. Essentially, it requires any attack that would destroy the shard to hit it during a different moment than the attack would normally land, making a defense not only immune to mundane attacks, but also rendering the user unable to be harmed by temporally-altered attacks unless the attacker knows the exact moment in time that the Timesplinter Cloak is keyed to. However, maintaining this defense is highly energy-intensive, and it cannot be kept on at all times."
500 CP,Cosmic Key,Masters of the Universe,"This portable cylinder is covered with buttons which when pressed emit certain tones. When a particular melody is played, the Key will open a portal that will allow you to teleport to the corresponding location bypassing any and all wards, shields barriers or other defenses or even into another time-space merging with your younger selves. Of course you have to know what melody to play, and the device doesn't have an instruction manual. One nice feature, it has a home key that will return you to the planet/general starting location of whatever jump you happen to be in."
500 CP,Inquisitor Cane,Babylon 5 - Crusade,"Vorlon cane, it can project holograms, energy blasts, bright light, and telekinetic lift up to about 200 kilos."
500 CP,Mobius Chair,Justice League Dark Apokolips War Gauntlet,"It may not be a Throne but it is a chair worthy of one of Darkseids most valued servants. Though it is not capable of granting whoever sits on it Omniscience, it does allow for the Observation and holographic communication of anything within the Universe. It is capable of flight and possesses various energy cannons, making it a powerful tool for combat. By using a special Protocol you can activate a program to let it automatically attack any enemies in the vicinity. Its final benefit is however not one for whoever sits on it but instead their master, as the Mobius Chair is capable of powerful torture, subjecting the one placed in it to agony so powerful even someone with the willpower to match the Dark Knight could eventually be broken and subverted into a pawn."
600 CP,Loki’s Scepter ,Age of Ultron,"One of the most dangerous objects in the known Universe. The Scepter itself is capable of bending the will of others to you with a simple touch. Even those with great will power are affected, and only those who possess more power than the Scepter itself, or incredible mental defenses could resist its effects. There seems to be a strange stone inside the Scepter, but I am sure that thing is useless"
600 CP,Phantom Zone Projector ,All-Star Superman,"The Phantom Zone. A deathless, static dimension where there is no aging, no starvation, no physical matter nor rest or release. In Krypton’s time, it was used for capital punishment in place of execution.

Escape is almost unthinkable. What you use this device for, that’s entirely in your own hands."

600 CP,Save Point Device,Rick and Morty ,"You have a device that allows you to save points in time similar to a game. The device has two buttons on it: A red button, which saves the user's place and a blue button, which sends the user back to their save point. To set a new save point, you just push the red button again. Unlike the original one, this actually brings you back to the save point instead of moving you to a new, alternate dimension each time you press the button. If you die with a save point active then you will automatically respawn at your saving spot. This can be merged withany item you own."
600 CP,Portal Gun ,Rick and Morty ,"Imagine doing anything you want, then hop to a timeline where you never did it.Imagine going anywhere, anytime, with nobody able to stop you.That is what this portal gun makes you capable of, allowing you to create a green portal that can allow you and others to travel instantly to any part of the universe, and cross into other dimensions. It is highly intuitive and easy to use, allowing you to find just the right world for your personal specifications in any situation.

To start time again, you simply have to push the button again. This can be any item and can be merged with any item you own. You are protected from Uncertainty and time shattering by using this, and no time police or other similar creatures can catch or notice the time stop."
600 CP,Time Dilation Accelerator,Spider- Man - The Animated Series,"This is quite something you've invented, Jumper. The Time Dilation Accelerator is a small device that opens portals into an alternate dimension. This dimension is empty except for the portals you make with the Accelerator, which are much closer together in their alternate dimension than they are in real life. Thus, you could easily open a portal across town, or inside a bank vault, or even stick one onto your own body so that someone punching your chest will instead have their arm vanish harmlessly through the portal. With further research, you could learn to open portals into different dimensions as well in order to travel the local multiverse."
600 CP,Sceptre of Eternal Glory,"Warhammer 40,000 - Mechanicus","This staff contains within it a shard of the C’tan known as The Burning One… or rather, the Silent King Szarekh’s does. Yours, however, is just as capable of releasing bursts of almighty flame on a grand scale, but is curiously empty—no doubt a trick of your Benefactor. However, if you encounter a being capable of being confined like the C’tan were, and manage to force it into the Sceptre, then you will likewise be able to draw upon its power to your own whim.
"
600 CP,Backup,Futurama,"You have an incredibly advanced backup system that takes a copy of your brain every moment to a
small sturdy hard disk. Even if your body should be destroyed your consciousness will survive in
this hard disk unless that too is destroyed."

Unlike other Infinity Gates, this one doesn’t need a gate at the other end. It can open to any planet in the Star Wars galaxy as long as you can find it. In future jumps it will open to any planet in normal space in the galaxy you are in."
800 CP,Reach Scarab,Young Justice,"You have a Reach Scarab implanted in your spine. It’s special in several ways; for one, it is permanently “off mode”, meaning the Reach cannot take control of the Scarab- and therefore you- in any way. Second, it can be removed from your spine without killing you. Finally, despite being sentient the Scarab does not take up a companion slot as long as it remains in Scarab form. The Scarab grants its host several superhuman abilities: It is capable of constructing objects and shifting shape with nanotechnology, has highly advanced scanners capable of scanning for life forms through buildings and detecting when others are lying, translating seemingly any language, projecting  olographic images, extreme durability, flight, and sonic and plasma weaponry."
