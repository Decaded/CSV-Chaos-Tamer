0 CP,Chapter Serfs/Warband Slaves,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines ","A great deal of manpower is needed to keep a Chapter running efficiently; not only are the battle-brothers too few to keep up with them all, but an Astartes's first priority must always be preparing for, and eventually waging, battle. As such, Chapter serfs are called into service from the Chapter's homeworld population and reside within the fortress-monastery, where they receive better training and education than you can find in most other servants of the Imperium. You receive a number of serfs of your own, enough to maintain all of your properties and to crew your voidcraft. These are “NPCs” with no real mind or personality of their own, although by interacting with them you can cause them to grow beyond this into actual people, potentially allowing you to take them as companions. You additionally have serfs that can craft ammunition for you, repair your vehicles and weaponry, perform maintenance, clean for you, cook for you, perform medical treatment for you, and generally help in all areas in life outside of combat… however, even there they have some use, as it is Chapter serfs who fire the weapons of a voidcraft during battle, and all of your serfs are trained to at least the same level of combat prowess as a properly-trained Guardsman, should the time come that they need to defend your holdings.

0 CP,Varren,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition.,"Native to the planet Tuchanka, these reptilian omnivores are savage survivors, and opportune scavengers. Their fangs and claws are very dangerous to unprotected flesh, and can easily adapt to most environments. This one has been trained, is extremely loyal to you, and acts much like any other dog you'd find on Earth."
0 CP,FENRIS Mech,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition.,"Designed by Hahne-Kedar specifically for security, this robotic canine is very friendly to its owner and their allies, while being a terror to its enemies. Their advanced sensors can detect weapons and narcotics, used in the same manner bomb and drug-sniffing dogs would, and this one is not hackable, meaning that pesky programmers won't be able to turn your beloved pet against you. You may import a pet you already own into this option."
0 CP,Barracks,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 3,"Everyone needs a place to stay. It’s a given, and any base that does not have barracks for the troops is a base that’s going to see itself failing catastrophically the moment a battle becomes a siege. They won’t be the most elegant rooms or the comfiest of beds, but they don’t take up much space and they do what they’re meant to do."
100 CP,Patents,Shepard Quest,"Getting things patented first requires getting your ducks in a row. But this team of lawyers will not only get your ducks in a row, they’ll brush out their feathers and teach them to dance. They’ll automatically take care of patenting anything you want patented, and will advise you on patent issues. In addition, this will also enforce your patents for you, even in regions with no patent laws, or against people who don’t care about patent laws (like the STG, software pirates, and Reapers.) No one will be manufacturing anything without first signing a licensing agreement."

Either they’re attached to a company you own, or you have a retainer with their “private investigator” firm. Either way the payments are already handled. Beyond keeping track of major events across the entire galaxy and providing relevant and insightful summaries, they also use VI programs and their own intuitions to find events relevant to you - even if “the intel suggests the Batarians might have crash-built a carrier or dreadnought in secret somewhere” might not be immediately apparent as to why you in particular should be concerned. They also have the resources to launch in-person investigations of various things around the galaxy, like looking for rogue super-soldiers in the Terminus or going through a secured-by-our-side lab. Only one expedition at a time, unless you add in more resources to grow and maintain a larger team."
100 CP,Mechanized Infantry ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition.,"We have to admit, the LOKI Mech isn't that good on its own compared to some other options. But a hundred of them? That's certainly a daunting prospect. You now control one hundred various mechs, all of which can be controlled from your omni-tool.

If any are destroyed, you'll find a brand new replacement the next day."

100 CP,Watchers in the Dark,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines ","The Watchers are a diminutive, robed race of creatures that now inhabit the fortress monastery of the Dark Angels, but who once lived on Caliban before its destruction. They possess a near-exclusive ability to resist Warp entities to almost the same degree as a Blank, although without nullifying the Warp around them as Blanks do. They communicate with one another through psychic means, and have been trying to guide the Dark Angels against Chaos since even before the Horus Heresy.

You receive a group of 10 Watchers, who will endeavor to aid you—although they will never actively fight for you, they are more than willing to assist you in other ways, even during combat. Not to say that they can’t fight; if attacked, they will defend themselves, and quite ably at that, considering that they once engaged in battle against the Warp-twisted mosnters of Caliban.

In the sheer scale of the war these will make almost no difference, but they will be very useful as guards ."
200 CP,Pet Cluster Lizard,Lexx,"Cluster lizards are large, aggressive, predatory reptiles with limbless, segmented bodies and thick, leathery hides.

They’re of incredible skill and have a wide set of talents and abilities to put to use in their missions ranging from infiltration to hacking. While they are of considerable ability, sending them against powerful Force users is unadvised unless they’re equipped with the correct gear, or a very good plan.

Whatever you choose, while they aren’t particularly mobile or durable, they are convincingly lifelike when undamaged and can be undetectably controlled without any sort of interference from any other time or location of your choice. Even from a place outside of time and space, if you have access to such a location.

She’s a powerful (and sadistic) biotic who wields a heavy shotgun and lethal space magic. On top of that, she’s brought her own Mantis Gunship. Hell, if she likes you, she’ll even sleep with you too. Technically corporate security, Eclipse forces are respectable enough to have with you, even if they’re notorious drug smugglers, gun runners, sentient traffickers, and sometimes even worse."

200 CP, Officio Assassinorum Detatchment,Warhammer 40k - Talons Of The Emperor ,"For those that defy the Imperium, only the Emperor can judge your crimes. Only in death can you receive the Emperor's judgment. When the Malcador the Sigillite first made the Imperial Assassins, he attempted to hide them from the Imperium at large, the space marines, and even the Emperor Himself. They were formed in that manner to give the Emperor plausible deniability over the methods some would call dishonorable- but the Custodes have ever been practical. Before anyone else, they cooperated with Malcador, and they had their help in matters of defense of the Imperial Palace and in the elimination of threats to the Imperium at large.

The Officio Assassinorum has seen fit to assign several execution forces to serve you. You get a few dozen or so from each of the different clades."
200 CP,Sentinel bodyguard,Halo - The Covenant,"Ah, to be thankful for something! In the ancient days, back before your kind was considered gods, and when they were still considered tools, back before your maker's maker lived, back in the days of the forerunners, you were considered essential. Cared for, and worthy of protection. While floating through a forerunner ruin with a team of Covenant soldiers, you drew the attention of a forerunner sentinel, which noted that you were without escort- the soldiers, as far as it was concerned, did not exist. So, this lone forerunner sentinel decided to accompany you on your travels. This display of favor has appeared to make the Covenant far more fanatical about you- perhaps they think you are a saint. If only you could explain the truth to them! Regardless, it is far from sentient, and thus is not considered a companion for the purposes of Jumpchain. But it will give you an added measure of security, should an overzealous Sangheili decide that you are to accompany him into battle."
200 CP,The Best Lawyers ,World of Lewd Superheroes,"Lesser villains go to prison when their enemies defeat them. You? You just pay people instead. You have a permanent contract with a team of the world’s least scrupulous attorneys, the kind that will defend your god-given right to steal candy from babies with a straight face. Far more importantly though they’re really good at their jobs and can convince a judge and jury to acquit you or your allies of just about any charge, no matter how damning the evidence is. All they ask in payment for their service is that you reward them as you would any other faithful servant. It’s probably worth mentioning that these lawyers are all smoking hot examples of your preferred gender. Take care though, as your defense team has much less power to help you outside of a relatively modern court system. If a dictator or an alien warlord decides to have you executed without trial there’s not much they can do to help."

They require no maintenance, fuel, or film, and will follow you around, filming and broadcasting your words and deeds at your discretion while protecting you from harm, perfect for giving thundering speeches from the rostrum and leaving it to the Fire Caste, bleeding out his life’s blood in the snowy wastes, to decide if your policies end in glory or in failure.

300 CP,Vault o’ Bots,Fallout: New Vegas,"Much like the Vault option but instead of people and amenities your vault contains a large army of MK-II securitrons equipped with gatling lasers and grenade launchers.

a dozen who have Best of the Best on top. Maybe they’re Smoke Knights, maybe pirates, or

sparks to help you out with tools, upkeep, and generally into things you can’t be bothered with at
the time. You also have several dozen highly trained engineers, doctors and whatnot, enough to make for several bands of repairmen, or keep mobile hospitals working, keep the test subjects fit and monitor ongoing experiments... everything you need minions and assistante for, basically.

They come with a number of built in tools, and are capable of rapidly self-replicating given available materials. The copies share all the properties of the original,"
400 CP,Elite Guard,Star Wars – Darth Plagueis,"While it is true that few beings exist that could directly challenge a Sith Lord, even should they attack en-masse, the current custodians of the Force may notice should you fail to be circumspect in your use of your powers. That is why you have secured the protection of a company of soldiers akin to the Sun Guard, one hundred and forty four elite warriors utterly loyal to you, each being well provisioned and skilled in countless forms of warfare, sabotage and espionage. To a man they are all exceptional warriors, easily a rival for the infamous Mandalorian clans, and a number of your personal guard are mildly Force Sensitive, not to an extent that they could be Sith but they will possess frightening reflexes, coordination and an intuition for threats beyond any other, and they’ll quickly adapt to perform any task asked of them. They also prove implausibly resistant to interrogation should one be captured, being well inured to torture or methods of mind control, and inevitably finding ways to commit suicide should escape seem unlikely. Should any of your guard die, eager recruits from their ancestral clan will arrive to fill in for their fallen predecessor."
400 CP,Full Strength Regiment,"Warhammer 40k: Ciaphas Cain, Hero of the Imperium","A regiment is the primary organisational unit of the Imperial Guard, and of the Imperial Army ground forces before them.

These are about 100 robots that operate on an electronic hivemind, completely loyal to you and capable of maintaining any and all properties that you own.

400 CP,Canoptek Spyder ,Warhammer 40k - Necrons,"Not all troops in the Necron arsenal were once Necrontyr. The Canoptek constructs bear the distinction of being entirely robotic in nature. One of the most important of these constructs is the Canoptek Spyder, meant to oversee Necron tombs while its inhabitants sleep. To aid in this purpose, the Canoptek Spyders are able to manufacture swarms of Canoptek Scarabs and direct them towards intruders, ripping them to shreds before they even have a chance to scream. Additionally, they are capable of repairing Necrons who are damaged beyond even Necrodermis' ability to repair.
"
400 CP,Lychguard,Warhammer 40k - Necrons,"The Lychguards of the Necrons are some of the most dedicated and incorruptible bodyguards in the galaxy.

400 CP,Vargard’s Spirit ​,Warhammer 40k - Necrons,"While most of your Necron minions will be non-sapient and fully dedicated to following every last order, there are still several Necrons below you who retain their free will. The Lycheguards, Deathmarks, and Vassal Lords can prove far less pliable than the average Warrior. Now you need not worry about any form of betrayal, as your minions are loyal to the point of death and beyond. They will never betray you through their own will, and hacking, brainwashing, or outright possession are off the cards as well. Do note that this does not protect you if you force them into a position to defend themselves."

Should he fall in the line of duty, rest assured that he will be restored the very next day."
400 CP,Wraiths ,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"Because sometimes the real weapon is the friends you made along the way. Here are a dozen commandos equivalent to Wraith Squadron for followers. Give them detailed instructions and they’ll do as you ask in an ordinary fashion. But give them just a mission objective, and they’ll go off the walls on a crazy plan that shouldn’t work, yet probably will."
400 CP,Purge Trooper Droid,Star Wars - The Orginal Trilogy,A prototype Dark-Trooper primarily designed to combat Jedi. This 2.5 meter tall behemoth can create shock waves by punching the ground and send men flying several feet with a single punch.

At 7ft tall, these imposing droids are practically immune to hand-held blaster fire and strong enough to single-handedly punch through a heavy blast-door. Built-in rocket thrusters allow each droid to deploy from a hovering spacecraft, conduct their mission, and return with blazing mobility. Networked for combat, these droids can coordinate with each other for deadly effectiveness. They are relentless, ruthless, and fearless, but lack the creativity and learning capabilities of organics. This  purchase comes with a bivouac bay to house the platoon, which can be attached to your warehouse or starship. It also comes with a power source that can bring them to combat readiness in 5 minutes and allow for up to a full day of sustained operations before a recharge was necessary. Even a singleof these droids would be a match for a fabled Mandalorian, and only a master Jedi could threaten the unit as a group. A fireteam of these Darktroopers couldconquer small towns. Imagine what you could do with a full platoon!"
