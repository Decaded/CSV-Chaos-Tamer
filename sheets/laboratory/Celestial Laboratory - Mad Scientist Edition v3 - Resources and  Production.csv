will take some time, but this factory will boom again."

These delicacies are sure to impress even the most discerning of connoisseurs, and are the perfect accompaniment to a lavish dinner or social event. Restocks itself monthly"
0 CP,Shrine to the Machine God,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus,"Plasma candles and sweet incense frame this small shrine. Items blessed by the devout upon the micro-altar feel surer in hand and swifter in use against those things anathema to the Machine God. But should your soul and intentions be profane, blessings will still be granted even as the altar slowly grows dark and rusted, an ugly asymmetry forming in the eight-toothed cog that now frames the Opus Machina..."
0 CP,Filling Meal,Warhammer 40k - Guardsmen Jump,"This filling meal can restore drained morale, uplift the mood, give energy, warmth and bring a small
amount of happiness to the bloody everyday life of a soldier. By taking this item you will be given a
satchel that is always warm to the touch (not appear on thermal scans). Within it you will find 2 different food boxes and 2 flasks. Each food box holds one dish of your choice that is enough to fill the stomach of a hungry Ogryn (it is more than enough for 4 grown men). Before you open the box, you can decide what will be in it, but it must be something you already ate at least once and they must be non-magical meals. The food will always be at the perfect temperature. One of the two flasks holds a non-alcoholic common drink of your choice (water, juice, milk, tea, coffee, etc), while the other one is filled with a weak alcoholic beverage of your choice (beer, ale, wine, cider, but no hard liquor). The flask can hold 2 liters of beverages each. The satchel can only be used twice per day, but you must wait at least three hours between two uses."

"
100 CP,Deeply and Greedily,Dead Space ,"There's gold in them thar hills! Also titanium, iron, copper, tin, zinc, and other metals, along various crystal or gemstone strata, maybe some coal or oil to smelt that metal with, or even some fuel-grade unstable materials like uranium. It's all so damn useful, too. Even more useful, now, considering that, whenever you actually go after a pre-existing vein of material, it'll always have a yield about a quarter more of the yield it might otherwise have, same with smelting metals that other people, or automated systems you build, dig up for you. Very useful if you're a do-it-yourselfer that likes to make things out of raw materials."
100 CP,Supply Rooms,Dead Space ,"No matter where you go, from the far-flung future to the distant past, you always manage to find these weirdly out of place, locked, barred, or otherwise sealed rooms. But, hey, they’re always worth
it. Well, almost always at any rate. They have a specific item that they need to be opened; in this universe, depending on where you are, it’s either power nodes or torque bars. In other universes, it might be a type of key, a puzzle door, or maybe a specially-prepared stone, or hell, it might just be an explosive. Whatever it is, it gets the door open, and inside, there’ll be loot; usually money, ammo, a slim chance of a weapon schematic(or a weapon, where applicable), and an even slimmer change of recouping the resource you used to get the door open. Sometimes, though, it is so, so not worth the time spent opening it, with extremely slim pickings, the bare minimum of what little you do manage to find available."
100 CP,Mining,Elite: Dangerous,"You’re a natural at this mining thing; you know just where to cut into an asteroid so you get all of the resource with none of the fuss, and you can place depth charges like a pro. You can work any of the mining equipment in this universe like you’ve been using it for years, and even new equipment wouldn’t take you very long to figure out.
"
100 CP,Nuka Cola Vending Machine,Fallout: New Vegas,"What the hell are you talking about, cowpoke? This here’s sarsaparilla country. If you do have a taste for the second biggest soft drink in the region this vending machine is never short of them and doesn’t charge a cap. Occasionally you’ll even get one of the special edition nuka colas. Still has that slightly radioactive taste but won’t do you any harm."
100 CP,Beginner’s Chest,Generic Minecraft,"Whenever you start a new Jump, including this one, you’ll gain the bare necessities to live for a day or two and some tools to help you integrate into society or build a place to live in. For this Jump, it would be some leather armour, a stack of torches, some iron equipment and a book detailing the basics of Minecraft."
100 CP,Repair Bay,Halo - UNSC ,"Sending soldiers and vehicles out to complete objectives and stop the enemy from completing theirs is just common sense. You win the war by denying the enemy their win. But the constant battles and struggles will cause some wear and tear on your equipment, to say nothing of the damages that can be accrued by your ship. You need to keep it in order. This installation into your vessel gives a rather substantial repair center so that you can repair and salvage various parts of both vehicle and personal equipment, while having a supply of spare parts for the ship on hand if you needed to lick your wounds after a battle with the Covenant."
100 CP,Hydrogen Power Cells ,Halo Termination,Advanced power cells that can generate a large amount of energy for hundreds of years. A pair of these cells can keep a T-850L fully operational for almost 600 years and they can also come handy as an improvised explosive that can detonate with the power of a miniature Hydrogen bomb if damaged or set up to detonate. They can be used to provide energy for a lot of electronic devices or can be used to serve as a power source for electric vehicles. With a single purchase you will be given a pair of these power cells and an adapter that can link up the cells and any electronic device you want to power with them and they can be used as a power pack for phased plasma weapons which will give a hundredfold increase in ammo capacity for man portable PPWs.

Regardless of which form you are in, you gain a regular supply of meals that would fulfill all of your body’s nutritional needs, is actually appealing to you in taste, and has enough in it to satisfy you. The meals will change in small ways from each other, and will have a nice liquid for you to consume with it.

You also gain whatever utensils you may need/desire for it, and the detritus of your Ration will disappear once you are finished eating."
100 CP,Element Zero ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"With how important Element Zero, more commonly known as Eezo, is to the technology here, it would be disappointing if you could make use of that tech in the future because you were missing this component. As such, by purchasing this you will receive a specialized container filled with fifty pounds of pure Eezo every month"
100 CP,Weapon Modification Kit,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"So many weapons, so many options. And that's not just talking about how many there are, as there are just as many modifications you can add to them. This workstation is chock full of various weapon modifications for numerous kinds of weapons, as well as the tools needed to manufacture your own. If you want to give your favorite rifle a powerful scope, or increase the spread of your  shotgun, this is the choice for you."
100 CP,Power Source,Megamind,"A trinket of some sort that you can easily hold in your hand. It seems innocuous enough, aside from the glowing, but it’s actually a perpetual source of energy and an excellent focus for devices that project energy. The only issue is that it doesn’t provide that much energy, only enough for tools and personal equipment, nowhere near enough to support a whole lair…let alone an empire.
"
100 CP,Matter Synthesis,Orville,"This is a device that allows for the dematerialization of matter and rematerialization of that matter as something else. This device allows it to reproduce nearly any amount of inorganic material when requested and has an advanced computer to allow for new materials to be reproduced with new instructions. The Synthesizer can create any inorganic material and even organic material such as food or beverages at virtually no cost, but cannot create power sources or fuel such as Dysonium as that entails a net energy loss. For example, you could use this device to create the structure and frame of something such as a smartphone, but the power for that smartphone must come from somewhere else as powering it using the Synthesizer will result in a net energy loss. This comes with blueprints to make more Matter Synthesizers."
100 CP,Trophy Cleaning Kit,Predators,"A kit to preserve and clean the skulls (or other body parts) of prey. The process is
very fast with the given tools, and works on any corpse (or parts of corpses).
Portable enough to take into the field with you."
100 CP,Kryptonite ,Smallville,"A few kilos of glowing green rock a week. In some conditions, they can induce powers in those with a metagene. Besides, the Kryptonians used the stuff as a power source for millennia and if there’s one thing Krypton is famous for, it’s nothing bad happening to it. Ever."
100 CP,Trellium-D ,Star Trek - Enterprise,"A handy material that proofs your ship against spatial distortions, as are common in the Delphic Expanse. Also insulates against other exotic effects that might warp, distort, dimensionally shift or corrupt your ship. Unfortunately addictive to Vulcans and can turn them into rage zombies. Thirty barrels, refills weekly."
100 CP,Hydroponics Containers ,Star Trek - Voyager,"These could be put into a bay specialised for that purpose, or just kept somewhere for yourself. They contain a variety of flowers and insects, which won’t escape or cause a mess. Feel free to use them for experiments, decoration, or potentially as food if you or a friend develops odd cravings. Surprisingly, they’re perfectly alright for any species to eat with no complications."
100 CP,Electronics ,Star Wars - KOTOR,"A large supply of computer spikes and repair parts that can be used with nearly any modern machine in the galaxy.

100 CP,Misplaced Munitorum Munitions​ ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Astartes","Well, the Munitorum is the Munitorum... This large shipping crate was probably originally intended for an Imperial Guard regiment. Instead, somehow, it has ended up in your armory. Inside is a selection of basic weaponry suitable for equipping several squads of Imperial Guardsmen. 30 Lasguns, 30 Laspistols, 3 Long-Las Marksman Weapons, power-packs, 30 suits of flak armor, and 30 comm-beads plus a long-range vox backpack. It’s not a patch on what the average Space Marine wields in battle, but it could be useful, yes? The crate is refilled once a month when nobody's looking. Curious."
100 CP,Nightweave Silk,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade,"There are many treasures to be found among the Halo Stars in the Koronus Expanse, recovered by traders who brave the unknown for untold riches and power that can be found so long as one seeks it out. One treasure is this opulent fabric woven from a crystalline material, shimmering with a spectrum of soft inner light when it is worn in twilight or darkness. Psykers will claim to detect the faintest echoes of suffering and something inhuman, but many human lords highly praise it for its effect and great beauty akin to a night sky... as well as the bragging rights that come with its rarity. You may choose to either have a supply of the fabric on hand or implement it into an outfit you possess to gain its properties."
100 CP,Rare Earths,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"A crate, refilling nightly, of any rare or exotic material that may be found in the Warhammer 40K universe, since the rulebook isn’t terribly clear on just what it is the Squats mine so much of."

His ships, his armor, his weapons- and that of the Custodes as well.

Resistant to nearly every type of energy and impact you care to name, this material has myriad uses. You will receive shipments equal to any project you care to use it for. Simply order it, and within a day it will appear, either in your warehouse or at a location of your choosing."
100 CP,Tool Kit,Warhammer 40K -- Adeptus Astartes,"A rather nice set of tools from the grim darkness of the 41st Millennium. Durable, this comprehensive (if a bit basic) set of tools is just about anything you need to poke, prod, and tinker with the the technology of this universe. Of course, if you lack the actual skills to do so, it’s just a nice set of paperweights."
100 CP,Elerium,XCOM - Enemy Unknown,"A nightly refilling crate of Elerium, the power source for enemy UFOs. Very handy for alien tech and general power generation."
100 CP,Foundry,XCOM - Enemy Unknown,A dedicated facility for designing new weapons and improving on existing technologies. Ideas flow fast and free in this experimental space.

200 CP,Crafting Stations,Fallout 4,"You have each of the main crafting stations (capable of making armor, weapons, and chems) in your Warehouse; each one greatly simplifies the process of crafting or modifying items. In addition, each one also seems to have the filler items that you'd need; the various chemicals and parts that aren't a significant or expensive part of whatever you're crafting. They can't provide anything supernatural or rare, but small amounts of metal for a new gun mod or some dye is fine.
"
200 CP,Fusion Core,Fallout 4,"An extremely powerful, nuclear powered battery capable of charging a single large building for hundreds of years or a suit of Power Armor for a similar amount of time."
200 CP,Alchemy Workshop,Generic Minecraft,"This small room has only a single alchemical worktable and a chest that holds a miscellany of reagents and alchemy supplies. But the chest will provide a small but steady supply of glass bottles, pure water, and nether wart, which is the basis of all useful potions are made from. From time to time, you’ll also gain a stock of redstone, gunpowder and glowstone dust which are secondary ingredients."
200 CP,Crafting Bench,Generic Minecraft,"This crafting bench, although seemingly blank and lacking tools, will instantly assemble anything up to one cubic meter in size, provided you supply all the materials and know how to make the object in question. Strangely enough, it seems that items made this way are as though you’ve made it yourself the hard way and has the benefits of every perk you have related to crafting, though you can selectively toggle some off if you wish of course."
200 CP,Slush Fund ,Invincible,"You now have access to a slush fund, all of the money in this fund is yours, and as far as any government or other organization is concerned fully above board with all pertinent taxes paid. This fund contains 2 billion American Dollars in buying power circa 2017. All money in this fund can perfectly convert into whatever the local currency is.

This fund has an additional 2 billion added once per year at midnight on New Year’s Eve. This fund can be accessed through whatever the standard is for your locale."
200 CP,Nth Metal Deposits,Justice League: Unlimited,With an atomic number of 676 it's a useful material that can defy gravity and conduct incredible amounts of electricity. It's great at disrupting magical energies so I would advise against using it in magitech outside of as a limiter/disruptor. This deposit gets you enough refined pure Nth metal to make equipment for a whole platoon of soldiers. Plenty enough to work with right? It replenishes its supply once every month.
200 CP,Vibranium Sample,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1),"Vibranium is an extremely rare element that possesses unique attributes. In a pure mass, vibranium forms a solid metal that is stronger than steel, but only a third of the weight, as well as being completely vibration absorbent. This means it can absorb the impacts of a great deal of attacks, but bear in mind high-energy attacks WILL do damage... especially if it is consistent. Purchasing this gets you a container a foot in length with some Wakandan Vibranium shards that will replenish itself every month."
200 CP,Box of Resources,Mass Effect - Andromeda,"Have a box full of the Heleus cluster’s resources! Great for all your crafting needs, and ensures that you can always use your Andromeda gear. Omni-gel canisters, eezo, angaran meditation crystals, kett alloys, remnant polymers, eiroch fluid sacs, remnant cores, renderable plates, scale fibers, shell filaments, soft chitin.

This box is as big as the shipping container for the Nomad, is equally divided amongst the 11 resources, and will refill itself once a week."
200 CP,Mods & Augments ,Mass Effect - Andromeda,"Sometimes you just need to coax a bit more performance out of your tools. And sometimes, you just need them to do something else entirely. You now have both a full collection of weapon mods and augmentations, as well as the blueprints to produce more. The mods are usable on any weapon of the matching category, even in future settings. And the augmentations are fantastic when you want to change how a gun performs. Maybe you want an assault rifle that can never run out of ammo, or a shotgun that spits lightning bolts? Or maybe you simply want to change the firing options you have available? If you can break down and build a piece of gear, you can integrate an augmentation into it. And the better skilled you are at building that item, the more augments you can put into it. Keep in mind that some augments have different effects if they are on a weapon versus a piece of armor.
"
200 CP,Trade Goods ,Mass Effect - Andromeda,"When you are a foreigner in a new place, your money may not always be good there. Now you will have a stockpile of trade goods that you can use for barter. The trade goods will be appropriate for whatever race or culture you are dealing with, and will vary between luxury goods, rare materials, cultural goods, and so on. There isn’t necessarily a price that’s equivalent, but all the goods will be something valuable to the race/culture you are dealing with. For example, gold to some people is extremely valuable, while to others, it’s just a pretty rock. But with these goods, you will almost always be able to make a positive first impression. After all, everyone likes getting gifts. Your stockpile of trade goods is in some sort of container, such as a crate or locker. The stockpile refills on a twice weekly basis, and will also adjust itself to the target market every time you open it."

Gold, cultural relics and land leave the hands of the native population and enters into those of a new elite. You may not have been involved with the planetary conquest itself, but you’ve certainly profited from it. Enough valuable metals, gemstones and priceless artifacts to buy you a continent or two should you ever wish to retire to a verdant garden world. Beyond such obscenely expensive purchases this is quite hard to use or shift, what with it being a small hill of riches that weigh several hundred thousand metric tonnes"
200 CP,Toolkit,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,A portable kit that happens to contain whatever you need for nonviolent use. From the most sophisticated of first aid kits to a hydrospanner to a delicate artisans tool.
200 CP,Naquadah Stash ,Stargate - SG-1,"A super-heavy mineral of unknown composition, this superconductive material is the building block of Goa'uld and Ancient technology. Purchasing this perk gets you a small burlap sack's worth of unrefined Naquadah, but I'm sure you'll find a way to make good use of it."
200 CP,Mk I Naquadah Generator,Stargate Atlantis,"This device is portable by one person and generates the equivalent of a submarine's nuclear reactor. Unfortunately the larger Lantean or Wraith devices require far more power than this is capable of generating, but it might be possible to support them for brief periods, and is more than enough for something like a military outpost. It can be set to overload, giving roughly the same kilotonne yield as the Fat Man bomb. Comes with a lifetime supply of Naquadah fuel,"
200 CP,Mandalorian Forge,The Mandolorian,"A special forge hidden under a city and powered by Magma, the Mandalorian forge has flames hot enough to melt any metal in minutes and has the full set of designs for any traditional Mandalorian armor and weapons used throughout history and all the tools needed to shape any of then"

200 CP,Astartes Supply Cache​ ,"Warhammer 40,000 - Adeptus Astartes","This large armored vault is gene-locked to your genetic code and other biometrics, and is durable enough to survive being dropped from orbit on its own without damaging the contents. Inside, you can find a large amount of spare supplies suitable  for Astartes use. There are numerous spare parts for Power Armor in good condition, usually consisting of newer suits such as Mark VI or VII, allowing you to cobble together a full suit or two per month. There will also be times when you will find numerous damaged components of older models of Power Armor that might be repairable. Even more rarely, the occasional component or part of a suit of Terminator Armor may be found in the Cache, allowing you to have enough spare parts to build a single suit of Tactical Dreadnaught Armor once per year. Finally, there will also be large supplies of basic ammunition and replacement parts for weapons you own, both from this Jump and others, as well as five spare bolt pistols and bolters whenever the Cache is refilled. The Cache is resupplied once a month when nobody is paying attention to it."
200 CP,Adamantium ,X-Men Evolution,You receive a case of liquid adamantium which is the hardest material in this world. This nigh-indestructible metal once solidified in anything won’t be melted and is practically impossible to destroy.

300 CP,Tribute Chest,Fallout 4,"This large trunk, decorated with various raider adornments, is perfect for storing your loot, seeming to have much more space than it actually does. Additionally, you’ll occasionally find minor items inside of it that you haven’t placed there; ammunition, canned food, maybe some interesting scraps. Occasionally, you’ll get something more substantial; maybe a weapon or a piece of armor. It’s probably just the rest of your gang trying to keep you happy... but even after you leave, things will occasionally show up. "
400 CP,Precious Materials ,40K Necron Jump,"Plying their trade requires that a Cryptek have access to the needed materials and resources to perform their technological miracles, a need which often has them lured to a Lord or Overlord’s service with promise of first pickings from what a Tomb World has available. With this you no longer have to worry about such things. You now have a limitless supply of all the resources a Cryptek would requires. While this won’t include things that are truly unique in this universe anything else you have in limitless supplies.

The first cache contains a large amount of mechanical and electronic parts that can be used build or repair a wide array of weapons, gadgets, equipment, and cybernetics similar to what Batman and his enemies use. The second cache is filled with an incredible amount of chemicals, compounds and other substances that can be used to create things like biological mutagens, steroids, drugs, and deadly toxins.
"
400 CP,Asteroid Belt ,Elite: Dangerous,"Your very own collection of resource-rich asteroids, numbering in the hundreds; not all of them are winners, of course, but there’s still several dozen that would be worth millions to the right buyer. These even update in future jumps with resources from those jumps, and a handful of them will have rare and special resources like vibranium or element zero. You can import them into future jumps or leave them as a Warehouse attachment, but either way they’re sure to be incredibly useful."
400 CP,Junkyard ,Mass Effect - Andromeda,"Junk to some is treasure to others. You get a doorway that leads to a small pocket universe that is filled with the local area’s lost, broken and/or discarded items. You might find broken gear, ruined vehicles, or maybe a pristine limited edition item that someone just forgot about. Everything in here will be somewhat useful to you, but you get to decide if it’s use is as a source of resources, or if something is worth fixing. The doorway takes the appearance of an expandable hula hoop that opens a portal to the pocket universe. The pocket universe will refill with junk as you travel, or as the local area around you generates junk that will be siphoned off."
400 CP,Mining Facility,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Sometimes, civilizations are held back by the need for more resources, which they can only find by leaving their homeworld. What you have here is extremely useful, as this asteroid-based mining facility will deliver large amounts of resources straight to your Warehouse. From aluminium to titanium to even uranium, these monthly shipments are filled with enough resources that you should have enough to build a frigate within three months. Of course, the rarer materials will be in a lower amount than the more common ones, and you'll need to purchase something else in order to get Eezo."
400 CP,Universal Dysonium Fuel ,Orville,"Across the massive breath of the multiverse making up the Jump chain there exists hundreds of thousands of different Faster Than Light drives that all break Einstein’s rules in different ways. However, some of those drives require specialized fuels to either power the drive as no reactor has the power density to break the speed of light or the FTL drive requires a unique property of that fuel to operate, such as Tylium. The UDF or Universal Dysonium Fuel has you covered then, as this is a universal fuel that allows it to substitute all other possible fuels for every single FTL type drive or device. Dysonium is a transuranic element that can be naturally mined or artificially created either way, when you refine Dysonium into fuel every possible FTL drive will operate regardless of any other requirements. Your Battlestar ran out of Tylium? No problem, just use UDF, which only requires the energy of the Quantum Reactor equipped on the Orville or another equivalent to artificially produce it in bulk quantities. Also comes, with an ingredients list detailing how to produce this refined Dysonium fuel so that your allies or companions or NPCs can create it by themselves, so long as they have a power source equal to that of the reactor on the Orville. Additionally, there is another set of instructions to make solid Dysonium crystals, which can be used to create material specific FTL drives. So if your Jump Drive cannot operate without Handwavium or something else that is fictional, just replace it with solid Dysonium."
400 CP,Microverse battery,Rick and Morty,"The Microverse Battery contains a miniature universe with a solar system inhabited by intelligent life. These lifeforms produce electricity by merely existing, which is extracted by this battery to power whatever you want it to power.It will always produce enough power to fuel whatever you connect to it, and will never stop producing power. It can be connected to whatever you want, somehow being able to connect with any device. The people of this world consider
you their God, and can be whatever you want them to be. If you want an entire universe filled with catgirls and bunnygirls that worship you, go ahead. Or if you merely want them to be an autonomous hive mind then so be it. Time moves slower inside this universe."
400 CP,Replicator Technology,Star Trek - Voyager,"A replicator or molecular synthesizer was a device that used matter-energy conversion technology similar to a transporter to produce almost anything from existing replicator reserves, from fresh food to a variety of inorganic components to complex devices. While there’s nothing preventing other examples of this technology from being reverse-engineered, purchase of this Item provides your own personal replicator as well as data on its use and construction, with the guarantee that this and any replicator technology based on it won’t have unfortunate accidents or errors that tend to occur in Star Trek. Your personal one won’t keep logs of its use if you don’t want it to, and it’s not bound by legal or regulatory requirements that others might have. While this comes with a replication patterns for anything you’d plausibly be able to get from replicators you might find on Voyager, you’re free to add to this with things like specific recipes or duplications of complex items. Anything made via this sort of technology doesn’t have the same Fiat- Backed protection that Items purchased in Jump Documents have, though strictly speaking there’s nothing preventing you adding that protection if the means to do so are available. If you try replicating something like the One Ring, you’re just going to get a mundane golden ring rather than another with the same powers and capacities, with the same limitations extending to other Fiat Backed objects. On the plus side, it is genuinely impossible to notice any difference in taste or quality from food produced by this and those produced by other means."
400 CP,Mining World ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"In order to produce droids a large amount of materials must be gathered continuously. To deal with this issue the Separatist sought out planets with large amounts of materials. This is one of those worlds, it is filled with numerous large mines that ship out materials for production. This planet will be able to produce an unlimited amount of different materials however you will need to harvest them. Lastly you may choose the exact composition of the planet. For example you could choose for the planet to be made of adamantium.

400 CP,Nanite Fabrication Table,Stargate Atlantis,"This table has an indented, flat surface roughly the size of a coffin. It is specifically designed to assemble and program/reprogram nanite-based technology without needing clean-room conditions; if you have the right designs it could easily produce something like a nanite plague or medical nanites, and eventually produce self-replicating nanites which became the Asuran-form Replicators. However, the knowledge you will need to design and program any of these constructs must be sought elsewhere: this is merely the tool, not the craftsman."
400 CP,Factory ,The Batman,"You have your own factory that can mass produce anything you have made, if it is magical in nature or has exotic materials within it, it won’t be possible unless you upgrade the machinery within, it does have infinite common resources within it, and uses machines to build things more or less endlessly."
400 CP,Nth Metal source,The Batman,"A half a meter sized rock which contains enough Nth Metal to create armor out of. Nth metal in this universe has anti-gravity effects, you can load up a gun with dust of this metal and use it to cause things to simply float, or fly endlessly into the air. Thanagarians use this metal with all of their technology, so it is incredibly strong, and light. The nth metal regenerates after use."
400 CP,Workshop,The Batman,"You own a small workshop inside a building you own, if you don’t own a building this exists in your warehouse instead. You have common materials that regenerate daily, as well as the best equipment possible, which do upgrade per world."
400 CP,Moebian Steel and Prismata Crystals.,Warhammer 40k - Darktide,"A weekly restocking supply of Moebian Steel and Prismata Crystals. This is the good stuff. The really, really good stuff. A particular steel alloy of which the proper method of forging has long been lost and the modern alloy providing worse results, true Moebian Steel is far more durable than mundane steel allowing for better protection at similar weight, or similar protection at lower weight. Prismata Crystals, on the other hand, are used to make heavy-duty, large las weaponry. They’re pretty rare and highly sought after for military applications. Ten ingots of Moebian Steel and a small crate of Prismata Crystals come to you per week, and you can either use them to forge your own items or barter with various individuals to get better deals or special prices. Or you can just sell them. That’s also an option."
500 CP,Dwarven Forge ,Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2,"There is a place called Nidavellir. A place that has contained a dying neutron star, it was known for creating some of the most powerful weapons to exist in all of the Nine Realms. Forges were heated eternally from the heat of this star, strong enough to kill even the greatest of Asgardians were it not for one of the weapons forged in this very place. The mythical Uru springs from this place, metal that is used in the weapons of the gods. Such a place would cause untold prosperity or ruin depending on who held this place. Mayhaps the dwarves who controlled such a place realized the dangers of only having one, so there is a second structure that has been hidden away in the event Nidavellir was attacked. Maybe call it Myrkheim? Regardless, the heart of a dying star is yours to use in these mythical forges. Great works shall be created in these halls. Terrible, but great. Just don't get in the way of the focusing lens. It could kill you.
"
500 CP,Stargate Network Factory,Stargate Atlantis,"All the plans you need to build your very own stargate network, with an automated gate-building
factory that can be seamlessly integrated into a starship you own – though it may look very odd on a
small one. Either way, post-chain this gains an extra chevron for inter-universal travel (how you put a
destination gate there in the first place is your problem)."
600 CP,Centerpoint Station,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"This was never designed to be a weapon, being the Celestial equivalent of construction equipment. However, the sheer amount of power this immobile space station can harness beggars the imagination. The station operates by using an immensely powerful hyperspace tractor beam to safely move anything from moons to solar systems and even black holes on a galactic scale. This one has an incredible range covering somewhere around half the galaxy. However, this isn’t just a free superweapon or stellar construction device. You’ll have to decipher how to control it on its own and given that it was designed by the Celestials that’ll be quite the task, though it will provide quite a bit of information about Celestial technology."
600 CP,Forge Of The Gods ,Justice League: Unlimtied,"Hidden deep within an active volcano, this is a fully stocked blacksmith's forge filled with tools and a replenishing stock of magic metal and other materials. This equipment will allow any sufficiently skilled craftsmen to forge weapons, armor, and other items powerful enough to destroy all manner of men and monsters, and even combat the ancient greek gods. Anything you make here with the forge’s divine metal will be completely immune to damage from anything except anti-magic weaponry or sufficiently powerful magic. If worked by a blacksmith on par with Hephaestus this forge could reproduce things like the Annihilator and Wonder Woman’s mystic armor, but items such as that may also require the creator to possess some fairly powerful magic of their own..."
600 CP,Droid Production Plants,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"The bulk of the Separatist and Sith armies are made up of Droids. These forces range from the simple B1 battle droids all the way to the massive Vulture Droids that function as their main space fighters. This is a planet filled with numerous factories as well as space ports to construct new ships. These facilities will be capable of constructing any droid or ship that have the blueprints for. This facility will come with the blueprints for every piece of machinery used by the Sith. Aside from this the planet will come with a defense fleet on par with the ones used to guard any of the other major production centers. 
"
800 CP,Star Forge,Star Wars - Dawn of the Jedi,"The Star Forge doesn’t actually appear in the Dawn of the Jedi series, but it’s the ultimate war resource of the Rakatan Infinite Empire. Using the power of the Dark Side, and matter drawn from a star it can churn out endless numbers of warships and war machines. Your copy has been altered like so many of the items here so it will work using any supernatural power you possess and will not corrupt people unless you want it to."
