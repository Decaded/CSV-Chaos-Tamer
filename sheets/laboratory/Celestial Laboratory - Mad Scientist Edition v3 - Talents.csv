0 CP,G-Force ,Elite: Dangerous,"Humans aren’t built for anything outside of the range of Earth’s gravity; studies have shown that zero-gravity environments can cause issues such as muscle atrophy in humans over long periods of time, and that would likely only get worse if you spend ten years inside a starship with no artificial gravity. Luckily for you, you don’t have to worry about that; your body won’t experience any adverse effects from gravity, whether it’s too weak or too strong. Of course, you can still float away in low gravity, and you can be crushed to a paste in high gravity, but you won’t have to worry about your brain deteriorating because the gravity is too high for your heart to pump blood up to it or anything like that."
0 CP,Call me Mr. Necron,Warhammer 40k - Necrons,"One thing you have to admit about the Necrons is, the names are pretty damned cool. Trazyn the Infinite, Imotekh the Stormlord... there’s a panache to them. Now you get your own Necron name, complete with epithet. You may insist everyone use it whenever they address you or refer to you in the future, and people will do so regardless of what it may exactly be. If you ever get tired of it, you can select a new name and epithet and people will start referring to you by that instead. Your name also invokes an emotion of your choice in people, such as awe or fear."
0 CP,Basic Piloting Skills,Star Wars Squadrons v1.1,"This perk grants you the necessary knowledge and skill to pilot any of the starships you have

100 CP,This Should Be Spectacular!,Doctor Who,"Now, any idiot can put together a plan. It takes real talent to do things with style. Maybe you’re a quietly terrifying figure of dread when you enact your plans, or perhaps you’d prefer to ham it up ridiculously, instead... and yet still be taken entirely seriously. You now have the ability to bring a sense of style, a certain dark grandeur, to all your doings regardless of how important or petty they might be. In short, this perk makes you very good at presentation and generally being seen as charismatic and impressive, just like a proper supervillain should be. It also gives you an excellent poker face, one that only extremely perceptive people who know you very well have the slightest hope of seeing past.

100 CP,Fair Traders ,Stargate Atlantis,"You have a knack for bartering goods. You seem to haggle slightly more out of an exchange than others, and leave the other guy with the impression they got a good deal too. You can even work out fair (or unfair) deals when the goods or currencies are highly unusual – weighing the value of information against years of someone’s life, for example."
100 CP,Kindly Couple ,Superman - The Animated Series,"Raising a child isn’t for everyone. Children require constant attention, need rigorous structure, and some rambunctious kids manage to give even the best parents headaches. But you’ll get there. When it comes to children you have the patience of a saint, the discipline of a headmistress, and eyes in the back of your head (figuratively [well, maybe literally. I don’t know you]). You might not be the best parent in the world, but you’re definitely in the top one hundred."
100 CP,Administration ,Superman - The Animated Series,"You know exactly how to run a business. From speaking to the press to managing employees to attracting shareholders, you know how to do it all. Any company under your leadership is guaranteed to become an industry lead in an amazingly short amount of time. You can talk the talk and walk the walk. Furthermore, people know it. Your administrative excellence is so obvious that you’ll naturally climb the corporate ladder at a breakneck pace."
100 CP,Archaeology,"Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus","All Explorators worth the name know how to run a dig. How to choose a site, how to mark, search and lay out a site, how to carefully sift obstructions and prevent contamination of sensitive environments. Though most of the work is performed by servitors, some tasks are too delicate even for specialized models. Every Explorators can personally perform these tasks with both speed and care, and most prefer to."
100 CP,Imperial Ecologist ,Dune,"It took Pardot Kynes (the first Imperial Planetologist of Arrakis) less than two years to analyze the environment of Dune and less than two decades to figure out not only how Melange was produced (including the entire lifecycle of the Sandworms, but how to transform the planet into a green and lush world. That’s how in tune with ecology you are. Your ability to understand planetwide ecosystems verges on the supernatural, and your knowledge of the sciences of ecology and terraforming is second to none. Wherever you go, your connection to the planetary gestalt provides you with an extreme awareness of the ins and outs of the local planetary ecosystem, including any disruption to it, and a sense of how you can repair it... or exploit the disruption for your own ends"

100 CP,Whispers in the Wind ,Imperium Nihilus ,"Inquisitors will often be tasked with rooting out all manners of cults and secret organizations. Because of this, many Inquisitors have devoted a lifetime or more to the art of investigation and detective work. It is a difficult task that requires both copious amounts of skill, experience, and no small amount of luck. And while you may not yet have the skill, you are certainly luckier than most. Whenever you stay in a locale for some time, be it in some sort of Planetary Governor’s Hive World or a rundown Forge World, information has a helpful habit of finding its way into your ears. Whether it be workplace gossip in a factory or the sordid stories of the criminal underworld, you’ll hear it all. And though many of these pieces of information can be rather exaggerated, you have a knack for figuring out which ones hold a grain of truth.

Many are taught the culinary arts, the fastest way to a man's heart is through is stomach after all. the dedication to which a sister of the Adeptus Sororitas throws herself into her occupation is intense, and even the mundane skills of homemaking are no exception.

100 CP,A Craft Of Your Own,Emperor's Children Gauntlet,"All of the Emperor’s Children have a particular path to perfection they pursue, a skill that is the focus of their semi-eternal life. You may now select any skill from swordsmanship to painting, you will gain a prodigious talent in that skill."
100 CP,Not the Sanctioned Use,Imperial Guard Jumpchain,"Did you know a lasgun can be turned into a crudebut-effective grenade? By overcharging the power pack and throwing the lasgun at someone, it can produce a blast capable of breaking open the frontal armour of a Chaos Dreadnought. You are highly skilled at figuring out similar extra uses for any equipment you own, and in heated combat are quick to come up with unorthodox but highly effective applications of anything you have at hand."
100 CP,Master Haggler,Dead Space ,"You're good. Regardless of the situation, whatever you're buying, selling, or, hell, even digging up, you always just seem to find more than anyone and everyone else would. When you're trying to buy things from someone willing to haggle, you get about more headway in your direction. When you're selling things, you get that extra little bit as about one-and-a-quarter the money the person you’re dealing with would otherwise be willing to give you. Hell, if you find a loot cache somewhere, you'll find the same amount of extra money and/or equivalent trade goods in it, so long as you're the one digging it up and opening it. This could be great if you're trying to build a base of capital for a business or some other high-risk venture."
100 CP,Scrap Hound,Dead Space ,"You build. Of course, you need parts to build, and, of course, you need materials, usually scrap metal or leftover electronic bits and bobs, to make parts. Whenever you go looking for scrap parts to use as materials, you always find more than you would otherwise, five instead of four, twenty-five instead of twenty, whatever. When you build parts from materials or scrap, you always find you need less materials, on the same order as that bonus, to put those parts together. Really, really useful if you plan to build electronically-based weapons, armor, etc, or extensively modify your own, pre-existing, equipment through similar means."

You start to get a feel for “talking the talk.” Your lies get better as you tell them. As you speak with someone, you can reach a point where you two achieve an equilibrium where you start to understand each other’s meanings without having to spell it out. As you spend more time with an audience, you eventually figure out which words you need to say to sway them the way you want. This Affinity will endear you to possible romantic partners if they fit the mold of an orator."

200 CP,Junk Rounds,Fallout: New Vegas,With a reloading bench at your hands you can make ammunition with any old tat really.

200 CP,Weapon Mastery,Lexx,"There are some strange weapons in this world, and plenty of them aren’t straightforward to
use. But you can use them and use them well. Whether it’s a simple knife, a fire axe, a
military assault rifle, an alien designed disintegrator weapon, or a wrist mounted grappling
hook, you can wield any personal weapon like a master who’d trained with it all their life."

200 CP,Reclaimer,"Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus","Rare is the heretek with wealth or connections enough to acquire the resources to pursue innovation without raising suspicion. Most must make do with whatever they can scavenge or build for themselves, and fortune seems to often favor them when harvesting useful components from wrecked machines.

"
200 CP,Bounty Hunter ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"One way for a lone Squat to make a living, I guess. You are an expert in tracking people down, using means both primitive and highly sophisticated, from the jungle to the depths of the largest hives."
200 CP,Fair Wages For Fair Work ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"It’s a rough galaxy, and if you see someone without any guarding their back, you could take them for an easy mark. Never you though. Whether through the reputation Squats have through vengeance or your own demeanor, people always pay you a fair price for your work, and never try to skip out by killing you. Sure, they may try and kill you for other reasons, but such is life in these times."
200 CP,Programmer,Stargate Atlantis,"You're seriously competent at the art of programming, even to the extent of adapting programs to run on alien computer architecture. You could debug kernel code in your sleep (and maybe you have). If you can (or learn to) read Lantean or Wraith this includes programming in their software languages.
"

If combined with Infinite Improbability, someone will always, eventually, show up to give you a ride... somehow."
200 CP,Ordo Xenos,Warhammer 40k - Grey Knights,"Through some questionable decisions by the Inquisition, you and your Grey Knight brothers have been manipulated into fighting xenos for over a century, often under the pretense that these alien species have succumbed to the influence of Chaos or possess dangerous artifacts tied to it. Whether these claims were genuine or fabricated matters little now. The fact remains that this prolonged exposure to xenos combat has made you a veteran at facing non-human enemies. This experience has sharpened your skills, allowing you to adapt your combat style to effectively deal with xenos threats. Whether you face the insectoid Tyranids, the technologically advanced T’au, or the brutal Orks, you now possess a heightened understanding of their tactics, strengths, and weaknesses.

Your mind is fortified against the madness that surrounds you, allowing you to recognize the absurdity in the decisions and ideologies that others follow blindly. This clarity of thought helps you resist the charismatic pull of others, even in the face of seemingly inspiring or fanatical leaders. You have the ability to see through their ideas, weigh them critically, and understand just how foolish they may truly be.

You can withdraw from combat at will, evading retaliation and follow-up attacks effortlessly, leaving your opponents frustrated and unable to keep up. This ability allows you to dictate the flow of battle, striking only when the moment is perfect and retreating before the enemy can mount a meaningful defense.

250 CP,"Everything Shiny, Captain!",Firefly,"You have uncanny luck in junkyards, and have amassed a supply of useful parts. You’ve got at least three Compression Coils, and have Port-Side Grav-Boots and Catalytic Converters aplenty. You’ve usually got whatever parts are needed to fix problems with your ship, or with most other technology of an equal or lesser tech level. You can’t build a ship out of spare parts, but you have enough to fix whatever’s broken this time. Of course, the skills to do the repairs might be a separate issue… But you gotta start somewhere!"
300 CP,Manipulative ,Lexx,"Thanks to an exhaustive knowledge of human psychology, the ability to lie without any tells,
and flawless vocal mimicry skills, you are a master at manipulating others. This isn’t mind
control, so don’t expect to manage things like making people to betray their closest friends
without some serious leverage. That said, you are perceptive enough to recognize that
leverage when you do get your hands on it, and to know just how far you can push things
before people start to pick up on what you’re doing."
300 CP,Bounce Back,Lexx,"You recover easily and completely from even the most traumatic experiences. No amount of
suffering, torture, or humiliation will leave lasting mental or emotional scars. You could be

nothing happened within the hour after you’re rescued."
300 CP,Ace ,Stargate Atlantis,"Pilot human vehicles, puddle jumpers, F302's and even Wraith darts with surprising skill if you can get at the controls, pulling maneuvers and surviving furballs that even professionals would balk at. Your talents include enough multitasking and situational awareness to not even need a copilot or gunner in a fighter craft (so long as the controls allow for it)."
300 CP,A Presence in the Shadows ,Imperium Nihilus ,"For every Inquisitor in the galaxy, there are legions of men and women standing behind them, ensuring that they have all the assets and resources they need to succeed in their missions. Whether they be young or old, an Inquisitor cannot succeed without the plethora of manpower and resources they have at their backs. You are no exception and you’ve made it your goal to ensure that you will always have access to the most important resource in the galaxy. Knowledge. What this means for you is that you are now capable of forming and creating intricate networks of spies and informants across cities, worlds, or even entire sectors of the galaxy. From the downtrodden folks deep in the underhives to the common soldier to the servants of kings, you’ll have people feeding you information about the world around them, even if they aren’t entirely aware of what they’re doing. You’ll learn of the crimes within a world, the depravities of nobility, the extent of your enemy’s forces, and more. With information, a battle can be won without even a single shot. With knowledge, a war can end without even a drop of blood."
300 CP,Renaissance Man,Imperium Nihilus ,"The Inquisition is perhaps the most varied and diverse organization you may find within the Imperium. Every member is unique in their own special way, coming from backgrounds as humble as a simple orphan from a war- torn world to the sons and daughters of the richest and mightiest families in the galaxy. There are Inquisitors with a talent for technology, Inquisitors who are psykers, and Inquisitors with truly exceptional charisma. Truly the Inquisition runs the gamut when it comes to its members. For you, what makes you stand out amongst the rest of your compatriots is your mind. With your mind, you are what could be called a natural autodidact. To you, knowledge and information might as well be water and you are the sponge. There is no subject that you cannot learn on your own, no field of study that you cannot master. Whether it be economics, tactics, or something more creative, you’ll be making massive strides in them, years of practice and training jammed into months or weeks, even without any tutors or instructors."
400 CP,Can Stop The Signal,Firefly,"You are a master hacker, a ghost in the Cortex. You can, given the appropriate equipment, edit security logs while on the way to the server, preventing people from knowing you were ever there, or implicate Members of Parliament in scandals involving underage hookers. Even with the cheap Cortex-access pads you can get on a street corner, rewriting transponder codes and forging landing permits are child’s play. The world of data is your world to rule. "
400 CP,Master Jailer,Smallville,"For whatever reason, you are really, really good at designing cells and traps meant to hold superpowered people, with even a vague idea of what they can do. Just try not to leave anyone unsupervised in your death traps, yes?"
400 CP,Love Democracy ,Star Wars – Darth Plagueis,"For all that fatalists talk of corruption and conspiracies steering the Republic, it is equally true that the well chosen words of a senator can unravel those very plots and redirect the course of galactic politics. Those cynics would no doubt say that such instances of honest statesmanship are the exception to the trend, but then they haven’t met you. A cunning linguist, master debater and historic orator; your voice cuts through the din of debate and dismissal like a lightsaber through the air, as your words have a deepened impact on the minds of others and invariably force them to think on what you have said. Even when you speak as an otherwise uninvested party, your words have a strong influence beyond that of most of those involved but it is when you have a stake in the subject that your speeches become truly profound. When those you represent or a cause you’ve long championed is the focus of plight or policy, then you alone can stop previously certain acts and set whole new precedents in galactic politics."
400 CP,Perfect Publicity ,Superman - The Animated Series,"Sometimes politicians seem to get away with murder. Those amateurs have nothing on you. You have an incredible knack for getting away with just about anything and still end up being adored by the public. Illegally dumping nuclear waste in public parks? A corporate rival is murdered? Someone matching your description stole forty pies from a school bakery? They’ll find that those were actually done by a maverick ex-employee trying to discredit your sterling reputation or some other equally plausible excuse. This won’t work if you admit to any wrongdoing or against anyone that actually sees you commit the crime, though video evidence will always turn out too blurry to actually determine who the perpetrator was. It will also fail to work against any actual law enforcement, although they won’t have any evidence that would hold up in court."
400 CP,Genius of Zahndrekh​ ,Warhammer 40k - Necrons,"The Nemesors are the mightiest commanders of the Necron forces, capable of waging campaigns with such genius that mortal commanders would drive themselves to the point of madness trying to comprehend it. This genius is now yours. Your mastery of tactics, strategy, and logistics can only be compared to such luminaries as Zahndrekh and the human General Creed. You will be able to run rings around all but the greatest military minds without them even comprehending what is going on."
400 CP,Sinister Scheming ,X-Men - The Animated Series,"All villains scheme, especially those who’d be classified as schemers, but some are better at doing it unnoticed. Now you, too, are highly skilled in keeping your covert schemes unnoticed until the moment that you strike. You find your mind brimming with ideas as to how to perform a plot where none would be the wiser, even under the noses of powerful telepaths."
400 CP,Weapon Mastery ,X-Men - The Animated Series,"You are capable of using any kind of weapon that is designed to be used by a humanoid. This allows you to use even the future weapons you have never seen before. However, weapons made to be used by concepts such as Phoenix can still be unusable by you."
400 CP,Resource Efficiency,Mass Effect - Andromeda,"It's nice being efficient. It lets you make more with less, stretching out vital supplies even further. With this perk, any time you are crafting something, you can make it for half the materials. Just don't ask how you got a full cake from half the amount of ingredients. In addition, anytime you break down an item, you get the full amount of resources that went into it. So, breaking down a gun you made for 50% resources would give you those 50% resources, compared to a gun made by someone else who used the full amount in the construction, and thus giving you the total amount.

400 CP,Bespin Charm,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"Every rebellion needs two things; an inspiring speech and a fallback plan. With this purchase, you’ve got the former covered. A charismatic dog like you will have no trouble drumming up support for your cause or rallying your troops against long odds. This power will grow with your legend, matching your exploits and yielding greater returns. Who knows; topple an empire or two and you could lead a galactic fleet of civilians in a heroic charge."
400 CP,Snoke Protocol,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"Some people are too important to die. Now that someone is you. Once every 10 years, you can avert death. Regardless of your demise, your soul will be implanted in a clone grown by loyal followers. The new body will possess all of your memories and abilities, and will be guarded with zealous passion."
400 CP,Chain of Command,Firefly,"You have a certain charisma about you. You just kinda become the leader in a crisis, without anyone electing you; you’re just the one who takes charge and does what needs to be done. You almost never have to prove your superiority; people just start taking your orders when the bullets start flying, even if they hate your guts. Further, if you lead a suicidal charge, expect every one of your allies to come with you (even if you’d rather they stayed safe). "
400 CP,Mostly Harmless ,Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy,"Something about you makes people underestimate you... repeatedly. People will generally consider you to be harmless unless they are actively being believably threatened by you... and will default to assuming you’re not nearly as dangerous as they believed you to be before once you stop being an active threat to someone. Extremely smart people will prove to be somewhat resistant to this, but the average individual can be lulled into believing that you are mostly harmless a theoretically infinite number of times. Essentially, as long as you’re not doing the equivalent of pointing a loaded gun at them, they’ll assume you’re not a threat."
400 CP,Guardian of the Code ,Warhammer 40k - Grey Knights,"You embody the essence of the Grey Knights' martial discipline. This perk allows you to fight with unmatched skill in single combat, making you almost unbeatable in one-on-one duels. Whenever you engage a single enemy in melee combat, your reaction times are increased, allowing you to parry, riposte, and counterattack with supreme efficiency. You are a master of honor-bound combat and can hold your ground against even the most fearsome opponents."
400 CP,Invisible Webs ,Warhammer 30k - Primarch GF,"Anywhere you go, you have a finger on the pulse of whatever network of information is in place, talking to the right people, you can figure out who to ask if they know who the right person you have to go to who will direct you where you need to go. All the while, you can build your own robust information network effortlessly, and ferreting out promises and favors is as easy as calling up and saying “Hello.” Just be sure you can handle the price."
400 CP,Didn’t Match the Bullet ,Back to the Future,"You’d think someone like you would be in a jail cell, but no. Whether it’s bribes, threats or incompetence, it’s astonishingly difficult to connect you to any crimes. Witnesses fall silent; evidence goes missing. You’re not completely untouchable, but if there’s any chain of events that will lead to you escaping justice, that’s what’ll happen."
400 CP,Hidden ,Flash Gordon,"You are a master of stealth, able to disappear into the bush, or the smallest dip in the ground, to prowl the corridors of the Imperial Palace unseen. You also understand how best to hide things, whether a rocket or entire communities."
500 CP,Battlemaster,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition.,"Much like the Krogan Battlemaster, you are easily worth ten other soldiers, maybe even more. You've gotten the science of combat down to an art form, wasting no movement in order to maximize the damage you can do to your enemies. Additionally, you seem to have an odd proficiency with seamlessly combining both your physical and supernatural abilities in order to make you an absolute terror in combat, especially when you're close enough to see the whites of your enemy's eyes."
500 CP,Hellfire Sophistication ,X-Men - The Animated Series,"There is a limit to how much one can plot purely from the shadows. You need resources, and to get resources you often need to interact with others in more overt ways. So it’s a good thing that you’re skilled at such things as well. You possess the skills of a politician, and CEO, able to easily navigate the enemy infested waters of high society, both in the world of legitimate business and politics and in the shady underground world of backroom deals, blackmail, and white collar crime."
600 CP,Warlord ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"You are the heir to a Stronghold Lord, and thus have been groomed to take over and to
lead the forces of your Brotherhood in the field. You are a superlative tactician, administrator and leader, who inspires real loyalty from your subordinates."
600 CP,One Of Your Reputation,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"Whether you’re a former Republic Drop Troop, ex-Death Trooper, or even a fully trained Mandalorian, you’re a one-person army. You know how to fight, and have a storied past to match. You’re easily the equal of a dozen untrained thugs, and with just a little time to prepare, you could take down a score of expert soldiers. With more like you? Who knows what you could accomplish. Those impossible missions, legendary heists, and daring rescues might not be so impossible after all."
600 CP,Crown of Organa,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"Some leaders are forged in conflict, and some are naturally gifted, but the best are both. You’ve got the political skill and strategic mind to be Leia’s equal. A once-in-a-generation mind like yours could do a lot of things to shape the galaxy. Found a burgeoning government, balance the logistics of planetary kingdoms, and still have the political skill to run a covert resistance movement on the side."
