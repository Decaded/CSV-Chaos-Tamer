0 CP,M274 Mongoose ,Halo - UNSC,"Some vehicles just weren’t designed for combat in mind... at least that’s what one would think upon seeing an all-terrain vehicle like this. Being designed to go over nearly any terrain without much difficulty and able to carry an additional passenger on the back in a pinch, the Mongoose is one of the fastest land vehicles in the UNSC. It’s highly effective in regards to rapid transportation, reconnaissance and swift tactical versatility. The downsides? Its light mass and lack of armor means it can be unwieldy at times and can be taken out rather easily."
0 CP,Arvus Lighter,Imperium Nihilus ,"You’ll be getting a few of these for free upon purchase of any ship, dependent upon the size of the ship you bought. And trust me, you will want it, and so will your crew. Unless you want to find a landing spot on every planet or rely on what can sometimes be a dangerous teleportation trip, you’ll want a lighter to ferry you from orbit to planet-side. An Arvus Lighter is a small, general-purpose cargo hauler. Nicknamed “the Hog”, “the Little Pig”, and “the Onager” for reasons lost to time, this shuttle is a personal favorite of the Imperial Navy. Equipped with two powerful engines, this little vessel is void-capable and capable of carrying a few tons of cargo with every trip, along with a dozen passengers, a lot more if you’re willing to squeeze them in. Unfortunately, the Arvus Lighter is bereft of weapons, unless you count the Chaff Launchers. It may be durable but try not to stay on the battlefield too long."
0 CP,Flight Suit,Star Wars Squadrons v1.1,"A flight suit and helmet, which comfortably fits you. If you have taken a background that aligns you with the Empire, New Republic, or Rebellion, then you receive a flight suit and helmet appropriate to that faction. If you are unaligned, or a Drop In, you instead receive a ‘generic’ flight suit and helmet. Your flight suit and helmet are self-cleaning and self-repairing, allowing you to wear them as often as you like. If either is lost or destroyed, a replacement will appear in your Warehouse after 24 hours."
0 CP,Hangar Bays/Landing Pads ,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 3,"You may have fighters, you may have bombers, or even transport ships that managed to get through the war-filled skies to deliver reinforcements or supplies. But you need somewhere for them to land as a result. These large pads for supply ships will be heavily defended by whatever defenses and weapons you may have purchased, and the hangar bays will be built into the walls and underground for aircraft to fly into and out of with enough room to let them build up enough speed."
100 CP,Slipfighter ,Andromeda,"You get a Slipfighter of your choosing, there are 4 main variants: the Phoenix is a dogfighter, the Shrike focuses on anti-starship, the Centaur is an escort, and the Arc Light is a bomber."
100 CP,Bat Car,Batman - The Dark Knight Trilogy,"This is the tumbler, a prototype armoured tank. The vehicle contains twin forward-firing machine guns, a rocket launcher, explosive mines that can be deployed from the back of the vehicle, a vector-controlled jet engine in the back that can be used for quick boosts or ramp less jumps and a landing hook. Both front wheels can also eject to form the Batpod; an auxiliary motorbike with dual front mounted cannons, machine guns and grappling hooks. You also gain a remote control for the vehicle small enough to fit into your pocket. And yes it comes in black."
100 CP,Aero-Disc ,DC - The Fourth World,"A favorite method of locomotion in New Genesis, these two circular discs are meant to carry one foot each of the one riding it, allowing them to fly through the air. Keeping balance with them requires some effort, but after some practice, it’s just like riding a bike...a bike that can fly, at least."
100 CP,Crashed Spaceship ,DC Multiverse - Earth 11,"The vessel that first carried you to this planet, hidden in a secure and isolated location to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. There’s some old technology from your homeworld in here, including traditional clothing and recorded messages from your loved ones. The ship itself isn’t spaceworthy anymore thanks to the damage from the crash, and the engine can only handle short flights before burning out, but the framework and machinery are still present. If you have the know-how and some decent materials you might be able to get it working again."
100 CP,Vehicle Storage ,Fallout Series,"There aren't very many methods of travel left for the common man beyond walking and brahmin
wagons, so what you do have needs to be taken care of real well. You now have a dedicated
area just for this, storing and maintaining any vehicles that come into your possession."
100 CP,Vertibird,Fallout: New Vegas,"A craft similar to a helicopter with two propellers. This one has gatling lasers, missile racks, does not run out of fuel and is well armored and shielded enough to resist more than a few missiles and even an EMP. It’s even got a small stock of mini-nukes that replenish daily."
100 CP,Ghost,Halo - The Covenant,"A light, sleek one person scouting vehicle with 2 vicious plasma autocannons on the front. Similar to a motorbike in how it leaves the canopy exposed, this vehicle floats just above the ground, like most covenant vehicles, and has a broad front to allow for optimal ramming ability. Can turbo boost at 100 mph indefinitely at the expense of using its guns. Somewhat vulnerable due to its exposed plasma tank and blind spot, but far faster than any other covenant ground vehicle."
100 CP,Drop Pod ,Halo - UNSC,"More formally known as the Single Occupant Exoatmospheric Insertion Vehicle, this device has one purpose in mind: Get a human from high orbit down to the ground. Within the pod is an array of communications equipment, space for weapons, a crash seat, and rudimentary controls to direct the pod as it’s falling down to its intended destination. The reason these single-occupant craft exist is so that should there be anti-air fire, each craft destroyed is only a single fighter lost rather than an entire group. As the pod falls and the ceramic skin burns away, the temperature inside the pod will climb to high levels, hence the nickname of ‘Helljumpers’. While there’s brake chutes so it slows down upon getting close enough, just be careful when using them. This item comes with blueprints to make more."
100 CP,M12 Warthog,Halo - UNSC,"There are some things that are just so reliable that any upgrades you make are just variants of the basic vehicle in question. Reliability that is needed in a war of survival. That reliability comes in the form of this four-wheeled ground vehicle that boasts impressive speed, traction, and torque at both the high end and low end. Using hydrogen-injected ICE I/C plant and a Graf/Hauptman Solar/Saline Actuator, this thing can go for four hundred and ninety miles before needing a refill and could use twelve liters from any fresh, brackish, or salt water to turn into more hydrogen on the fly. While the default variant comes with a light machine gun turret that can be wielded by a third person, you may take the machine gun out for four extra seats for troop transport instead."
100 CP,XRP12 Gremlin ,Halo - UNSC,"In the early days of the Insurrection, there were concerns about what would happen if they were able to get ahold of nuclear weapons. After all, the war was problematic enough without them detonating weapons of mass destruction. After the Human-Covenant war began to break out, this vehicle was repurposed. The Gremlin is a six-wheeled vehicle that has considerable speed and maneuverability, and while it has no armor to speak of it does contain a powerful tool: The X23 Non- Nuclear Electromagnetic Pulse Cannon. Think of it as a focused EMP burst, being able to knock out powerful devices such as Covenant power generators and other relaying stations. Naturally, this means it’s dangerous against vehicles."
100 CP,Sentinel,Imperial Guard Jumpchain,"The Sentinel is a two-legged walker, commonly used as a scout vehicle or for mobile fire support. It can mount a chainsaw and either a heavy flamer, autocannon, missile launcher, lascannon or plasma cannon. Comes in Scout and Armoured variants, with the Armoured variant able to mount heavier armour at the cost of significantly reduced mobility."
100 CP,Taurox Prime,Imperium Nihilus ,"Do you know what the last four vehicles have in common? They’re all small and because of that, you can’t exactly pack a whole lot of weaponry onto them. Not only that, but that same size makes it so that they’re not usually as durable as a bigger vehicle. It doesn’t help that all four of them leave the rider exposed. Luckily for you, there’s a reason that mankind’s built all sorts of APCs and tanks. And the Taurox Prime is a great vehicle for anyone who wants something a little more durable. While not as fast as motorcycles and jetbikes, nor is it even as close to agile as Sentinels and Ironstriders, it more than makes up for its size, durability, and the weaponry it carries into battle. Whether it be in a hive, a jungle, or on the open plains, the Taurox can carry you and a dozen soldiers to your destination with ease, even while under enemy fire. And with the weapons mounted onto it—from Hotshot Volley Guns to Battle Cannons to Gatling Cannons to Cannons to Missile Launchers and more—you’re more than capable of firing back and killing more than your fair share of enemy combatants."
100 CP,Air Car ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"One of the finest on the market, this is the kind of car you'd find in the garages of the rich and powerful. It's easy to drive, can reach altitudes of 50 miles, has four luxurious seats, bulletproof windows, a trunk large enough to hold a body, and many more amenities that you'd expect a vehicle like this to. Best part is, you never have to worry about fuel or recharging again."
100 CP,Krill Marauder Class Fighter ,Orville,"A Krill Marauder class fighter is a small well armed fighter craft capable of high maneuverability. It is capable of FTL travel and has 2 forward facing weapons to engage and destroy enemies. Furthermore, it will return to you if lost or destroyed in one day, and you have blueprints to create more."
100 CP,XJ-6 Airspeeder,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"This custom-built airspeeder uses exotic materials and incorporated advanced systems into its design, it was fashioned for quick and comfortable movements. The vehicle includes an inertial compensator normally reserved for spacecrafts, two oversized turbofan engines, an electrogravitic gyro flywheel that allows the craft to make abrupt turns without traction.
"
100 CP,F-302 Fighter ,Stargate Atlantis,"Two-person aerospace fighter with dual railguns, naquadah-enhanced missiles and a special payload bay, built by Earthlings. Has a hyperdrive for in-system hops but doesn’t fit through a Stargate unless disassembled first (which it is designed for). Can be operated by one person if necessary."
100 CP,Puddle Jumper,Stargate Atlantis,"Your very own no-frills flying Ancient ATV, this spacecraft is a bit smaller than a bus and designed to go through the Stargate. Looks a bit like a truncated cylinder, internally segmented into front and rear sealed compartments for crew and cargo. It has extensive sensors, an armament of 8 drones, a very zippy sublight engine, surprisingly good shielding, a cloaking device and amazing inertial dampeners. However, it has no hyperdrive or any kind of plumbing, so it's best for short trips only (well, for certain definitions of short, since it can cross an entire solar system in under 24 hours)."
100 CP,Armored Limousine,"The Incredibles","You get the keys to a stylish limousine, parked just out of sight. It’s been discreetly enhanced with superhero-grade armor plating, which is completely undetectable without stripping it apart or trying to shoot it."
100 CP,Astartes Warbike,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade,"Soldiers run. You are not a soldier. You ride. This Assault Bike is a testament to that, blessed by the Emperor to serve as your personal steed. Capable of some very impressive speeds and strong enough to drive through a solid rockrete wall at full speed with no harm, it is also responsive enough to perform a full range of death-defying combat maneuvers that would put any stunt driver to shame. Even better, it will alter itself in response to your loyalty to Mankind in order to look as sleek or as outrageous as you deem necessary. Perhaps one day, even the heretical Doomrider will look upon your ride and be interested enough to race you before you slay him."
100 CP,BTLS3 Y Wing,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"A relic of the Clone Wars, this baseline Y-wing served as the Rebel Alliance’s dedicated bomber. This craft is best suited to deep strikes and hit-and-run tactics using it’s wide variety of torpedoes. However, it’s quite fragile. Better not get hit."
200 CP,Quinjet ,Age of Ultron,The small jet capable of transferring the group of Avengers in relative comfort over long distances in a short amount of time. You are now in possession of one of these jet
200 CP,Prowler,Farscape,"This ship is a standard Peacekeeper starfighter. Prowlers are highly maneuverable and capable of interstellar travel, but are poorly armored and ineffective against more heavily armored targets."
200 CP,Centaur,Gears of War,"The COG needed an APC that could also function as a light tank, in order to deliver troops around while keeping them safe. This vehicle was successful enough that they kept it even during the war against the Locust. It is equipped with large wheels in the place of tracks and has four-wheel drive and steering. It’s also armed with a single, high velocity main cannon that fires deadly high explosive shells, which is capable of holding up to six shells in its internal magazine at a time, which is mounted on the turret. As a bonus, it also has a high infantry carrying capacity,allowing troop deployment.Of course if you like, you could instead acquire an Armadillo, which replaces the cannon for multiple machine gun turrets and grenade launchers, while having six wheels instead."
200 CP,King Raven Gunship,Gears of War,"The Locust are not the only ones who are competing to be rulers of the skies. As an all-around, multi-purpose air transport/assault aircraft, the King Raven helicopter is mainly used to transport and deploy soldiers and can carry up to twelve personnel. This particular helicopter has been modified with a larger fuel tank, more durable armor than any helicopter should rightfully have, and multiple machine guns/rocket pods that could lay waste to the likes of Brumaks. The attached wing stubs grants extra weapon hardpoints for even more firepower, ensuring that anyone seeking to take the sky away from you is going to have a hard time. If you wish, you can instead pick a King Raven Mk. 2 from the Swarm Wars, which has more lifting capacity and has significantly greater armor."
200 CP,Super-Cycle,Generic Young Justice Fanfic,"A vehicle of New Genesis, goes just about anywhere and folds up into a neat little Sphere when not in use."
200 CP,Spirit,Halo - The Covenant,"A light U-shaped covenant dropship, this ship is just barely space- capable, and can carry up to 30 passengers in 2 cramped troop bays along the branches of its U, and 2 ghosts -or one wraith- between them. It is lightly armed and heavily armored, with only one heavy turret located beneath the pilot's seat. Nonetheless, it is extremely protective, and can sustain fire from enemy main battle tanks, though the turret may be destroyed. It has a gravity lift that can carry personnel into the dropship, as well. It has a maximum speed of 700 Miles per hour."
200 CP,Space Racer’s Bike ,Invincible,"You have received a perfect copy of Space Racer’s space motorcycle. It is a flying motorcycle that can fly extremely quickly, fast enough to keep up with a young Viltrumite, and is able to go FTL at the speed of full on capital ships."
200 CP,War Wheel,Justice League: Unlimited,"One of the Nazi superweapons invented by Vandal Savage in WW2. A giant monowheel tank covered in spikes and armed with two heavy cannons. This thing will tear through even modern tanks and vehicles, but most superpowered individuals won't have any problem taking this thing down."
200 CP,Kodiak Shuttle ,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"Often called the ""Combat Cockroach"" by the Human Alliance, the government that made and primarily uses it, this is a durable personnel carrier capable of planetary flight and limited FTL. It can carry up to 14 people, including the pilots and a VI, and can withstand hard vacuums, high pressure, and temperatures from near-absolute zero to over 900 degrees Celsius."
200 CP,M35 Mako,Mass Effect - Legendary Edition,"This vehicle was designed by the Human Alliance for their frigates, made for rapid deployment, and can be deployed on virtually any world. It's armor is tough enough to withstand high drops, extreme heat and cold and rough terrain, with the suspension and propulsion system allowing the vehicle to adapt to various terrain. It's not unarmed either, as it is in possession of a 155mm mass accelerator and a mounted machine gun, it's perfect for both travel and combat."
200 CP,Union Shuttle ,Orville,"A standard issue shuttle craft used by the Planetary Union to transport cargo as well as personnel. It has seats for 6 human sized people including 2 for the pilots, but at maximum capacity can carry 32 human sized people. It is capable of travel at faster than light with its Quantum Drive and has a food synthesizer to create food, a cloaking device for stealth, deflector screens for protection which can also be used to protect the occupants from extremely strong gravity and a versatile docking port to allow for docking several different ports. If you don’t like the shoe shaped shuttle, then you can opt for the 3rd season redesign. Furthermore, it will return to you if lost or destroyed in one hour, and you have blueprints to create more."
200 CP,THE CHOPPER ,Predator,"Waving your hands in the air summons this Huey helicopter to pick you up. It'll take you anywhere on the same planet. The pilot and co–pilot will provide commentary in flight, but are functionally part of the chopper. Should it be destroyed, it will become available within 24 hours."
200 CP,Dark Force Cage,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Sometimes you just want to transport a powerful prisoner without all the hassle of building a strong enough cage to contain them. That’s where this comes in, the Dark Force Cage serves as a solution to this age-old dark lord problem. Prisoners placed within its crackling confines will find all their abilities simply cease to function; the Force refuses to answer, and so on, and so forth. Makes for a handy and portable solution given its ability to transport itself. "
200 CP,The Millenium Falcon,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Not the actual ship but a copy of the famous heavily modified YT-1300 Freighter that’ll serve you just as well, if not better given it lacks the constant maintenance issues the real one has and plague Han and Chewie so much. Should you desire you may pick a similar freighter type from this time period to instead gain.
"
200 CP,X-Wing,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"A trusty craft, scarred by innumerable battles, but still ready for more, this T-65 X-Wing has served you well over the years despite its age. You’ll find it easy to upgrade over the coming years and even without upgrades it’ll do curiously well against the advancing technologies of the galaxy. Should you desire, one can exchange this for a differing fighter used by the Republic during this time period.
"
200 CP,Pod Racer ,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"This high tech, high speed vehicle has been built with top of the line engines and top of the line Safety Systems that make this racer virtually crash proof even when going at mach speeds.
"
200 CP,T-47 Snowspeeder,Star Wars Movies Compilation - The Star Wars Saga,"This light airspeeder is equipped with a specialized tow cable that allows it perfect accuracy when firing to grapple onto a target. This airspeeder has also been equipped with a specialized temperature shield that allows it to negate any external temperature variants and function in any environment.
"
200 CP,Imperial Knight,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"The Imperial Knights are small to medium sized walkers used by forces throughout the Imperium. They are predominantly used by the so-called Knight Houses and the Freeblades. The Knights are all smaller and considered to be less dangerous than any Titans. The primary difference in the various types of Knights depends on the main armaments. You may use this option to purchase any Imperial Knight or Chaos Knight variant that you desire. Lastly these Knights will already be bonded to you, so you don’t have to perform the Ritual of Becoming to earn the respect of the machine spirit.
"
200 CP,Private Yacht,Superman - The Animated Series,"Enjoy the finer things in life. Like this massive luxury yacht. It comes complete with all the amenities such as a full bar, an indoor swimming pool, an outdoor swimming pool, a casino, a personal theater, a small library, a conference center, a fully stocked kitchen, numerous bedrooms, and a virtual intelligence that controls and automates everything."
200 CP,Super Bike ,Teen Titans,"Your very own custom motorcycle. This bike comes equipped with an anti-collision system, auto-pilot, automatic stabilizer, holographic computer, self-diagnostic system, wireless communicator, a small rear cargo space and two front weapon mounts. It's Powered by a high capacity electric engine and can travel up to 200 mph."
200 CP,Private Jet,The Boys,"Isn't this something. You own a private jet. This jet has been made so that no one can track it once it takes off, not even the Homelander."
200 CP,Jumpercycle,"The Incredibles","A sleek electric jet-powered super-motor bike with quite a torque on it. The dashboard is fitted with a small computer console that monitors police reports and works as a phone amongst other things. One of the other key features on the bike is that it can break up into two unicycles, with each wheel having its own motor to allow them to move independently. Additionally, it comes in whatever color you would like and has a bright glowing insignia matching your super suit on the sides."
200 CP,Nightwing,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"This aircraft, a fighter-interceptor designed for speed and maneuverability, is first and foremost a dogfighter, taking on other aircraft with ease. Moreover, in order to protect it from enemy fire, the Nightwing is equipped with twin-linked Shuriken Cannons and a holo-field that blurs its movements."
200 CP,Fury Interceptor ,Warhammer 40k - Navy Jump,"Primarily serving in void combat, the Fury can also serve as a very heavy attack craft in atmospheric actions. There it is intimidatingly powerful, with a turreted twin linked long barreled lascannon, 2 long barreled lascannon banks with 5 linked lascannons each, and 12 void capable missiles. It has a crew of 4, with a pilot, copilot, forward gunner/crew chief, and tech-priest enginseer, and moves at a cruising speed of 2,500 kph. Still, for all it's impressive might, it's unlikely to do any significant damage to a warp capable void ship. Instead, Interceptors are used defensively to pick off enemy small craft and torpedoes, and offensively to suppress the enemies anti-small craft turrets to allow assault boats and bomber to make their attacks."
200 CP,Starhawk Bomber ,Warhammer 40k - Navy Jump,"To many within and without the navy, the idea of a craft slightly smaller than an assault boat posing a credible threat to a capital ship can seem laughable. Those laughing have generally not been on the receiving end of a bombing run. They may be slow for void small craft, with a cruising speed of a 'mere' 1,800 kph, and are less armored as well, but they can pack a punch that can cripple far larger ships under the right circumstances if well handled. It carries a Pilot, Copilot, 5 Gunners, a Bombardier, & a Tech-Priest Enginseer. As secondary anti-small craft weapons it carries a Twin Linked Lascannon, 2 Twin Linked long-barreled multilaser turrets, and 2 remote twin linked heavy bolter turrets. For it's main weapons it carries 10 anti-voidship missiles and 40 plasma bombs."
200 CP,Venerable Land Raider,Warhammer 40K - Talons of the Emperor,"These battle tanks cum transports are some of the most versatile vehicles deployed by the Imperium, and the Venerable masterworks deployed by the Talons are the most potent of them. Molded from auramite and adamantine, these hyper resilient vehicles possess machine spirits of incredible potency, which are fully capable of controlling both the auto-repair protocols and imparting incredible accuracy to the weapon systems of the land raider. There exists more than one account of a venerable land raider’s bold and aggressive machine spirit wreaking bloody vengeance upon foes that have slain its crew. The land raider posses significant armaments: a twin heavy bolter, two twin lascannons, a pintle mounted storm bolter, a hunter killer missile, and smoke launchers. There are few foes capable of enduring this fury, and fewer still capable of damaging its heavy armor."
200 CP,Scout Salamander ,"Warhammer 40k: Ciaphas Cain, Hero of the Imperium","Unfortunately this does not give you a Space Marine pal, but you get the next best thing: a car with a big gun. The Salamander is a small reconnaissance vehicle used by the Imperial Guard and based on the Chimera chassis. It is designed primarily for reconnaissance duties and is lightly armed and armoured but very fast. It possesses an Autocannon to defend itself and the engine can be overcharged if some extra speed is needed."
200 CP,TIE/fo Space Superiority Fighter ,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"The workhorse of the First Order, the TIE/fo improves on the older Imperial TIE fighter by incorporating deflector shields and a more efficient power plant. However, this new TIE still lacks a hyperdrive, making the pilot reliant on carrier vessels. Alternatively, you can choose to purchase a TIE/sf, a two-seater version that adds a rear-facing gun turret."
"200 CP
",Airship ,Girl Genius,"A Hero who can’t get places wouldn’t be very useful, would they? On the other hand, this might
be a bit much... While nowhere close to Castle Wulfenbach, this is nonetheless a giant airship,
with room for hundreds of people to live in obscene luxury, several sets of extensive labs and
kitchens, and an NPC crew to manage everything. Also moves really fast through the air, and has a full military complement more than enough to fight off most everyday combatants it may be expected to face."
300 CP,Bioship ,Generic Young Justice Fanfic,"A Martian techno-organic starship. Capable of radical reconfiguration and impressive stealth, but unarmed as a default."
300 CP,M808B Scorpion,Halo - UNSC,"Sometimes you just need to murder everything around you. Sometimes you just need to prove that it’s Humanity that has the right to live among the stars, not some genocidal aliens who think their gods told them to kill everyone. That’s when you need this large battle tank covered in a ceramic-titanium hull and equipped with an M231 Medium Machine Gun and a beautiful M512 90mm cannon that shoots tungsten armor-piercing ballistic capped rounds. Along with an autoloader so that you only need one pilot, you’ll be annihilating even the mighty Mgalekgolo with a single hit."
300 CP,Leman Russ,Imperial Guard Jumpchain,"The Leman Russ is the standard heavy tank of the Imperial Guard. It is not particularly fast, but it is extremely heavily armed and armoured. It carries a large calibre Battle Cannon in the turret and either a heavy bolter or a heavy flamer in the hull. "
300 CP,Valkyrie,Imperial Guard Jumpchain,"A Valkyrie is both a troop transport and a gunship. It carries enough space for a dozen men, a multi-laser, and either Hellstrike missiles (which are designed to knock out vehicles) or rocket pods (which are designed to take on groups of infantry at once) "
300 CP,Goblin Glider,Spider-Man Trilogy,"Surprisingly fast and agile, this one person aircraft has just enough oomph to carry a second person without penalty. Optionally available as a Hover-board, it comes equipped with a veritable arsenal of weapons. This includes a flamethrower and  missiles, retractable blades, and a small horde of vaguely pumpkin styled bombs in fragmentation, smoke, and incendiary varieties."
300 CP,Basilisk War Droid,Star Wars - KOTOR,"A heavily armored large bearlike battle droid equipped with laser cannons, missile launchers, and jet boosters. The user controls it by riding it's back. It can survive atmospheric re-entry. Cannot be stored in starfighters. Highly illegal to own."
300 CP,Firestorm ,XCOM - Enemy Unknown,"An advanced aircraft built using the materials and knowledge gained from the alien UFOs. Power and navigational systems in particular were adapted right in, while alien materials science allows for a lightweight, but incredibly strong airframe. Armed with a Fusion Lance."
300 CP,D77-TC Pelican ,Halo - UNSC,"A tried and true vehicle, ever since 2393 when it was first introduced and utilized by the UNSC and has been prized for its cargo capacity ever since. While it can carry ten people in its compartment normally with five additional people standing, it can also do this while carrying seventy tons on its back tail... which can include a Warthog, resupply canisters, a deployment pod to increase its passenger count to forty-six, or even a large tank. It’s not to say this vehicle is unarmed either, being equipped with twin-linked M370 70mm autocannons and two air-to-surface missile pods, while the passenger bay can be equipped with an AIE-486H Heavy Machine Gun to give some covering fire. Along with the ability to go into space, it’s almost the perfect dropship. If you seek an upgrade from this, you can pay an additional +100CP to a powerful G79H-TC Pelican variant, which also adds an M8C Nonlinear Cannon as a larger version of the M6 Spartan Laser on its nose and a 90mm gun turret on the back of the Pelican along with a railgun turret on each side."
300 CP,Razor Crest Mandalorian Gunship ,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"Designed as a patrol craft for small security forces, this gunship has been converted to be a fighter, troop transport, and mobile home all-in-one. The lower through-deck maximizes cargo space, whether you’re hauling cargo or soldiers, and even features a mobile carbonite freezer. The upper deck is split between the cockpit, your quarters, an escape pod, and the ship’s powerplant. Rugged, useful, and powerful, the Razor Crest is perfect for the solitary hero."
400 CP,Javelin,DC Universe,"A ship capable of traveling underwater and into deep space. Has enough room to seat 6
comfortably. Lightly armored, armed with advanced laser weapons, and equipped with a wormhole
generator. "
400 CP,Alien Recon Craft,Fallout Series,"This is one ride that's out of this world. Though it may look a bit small, and can only fit four people, this spacecraft is well worth it. It requires no refueling, it can fly faster and is more agile than any vertibird and comes equipped with a set of energy weapons that can fire out the front. It even comes with an air purifier and is vacuum sealed, allowing you to fly through the empty vastness of space."
400 CP,Assault Derrick,Gears of War,"THE name in deployment vehicles, and further proof that anything can be weaponized if someone is creative enough. The Derrick carries out a number of different roles, including troop and supply transport worth up to several squads, and grindlift deployment which sends troops to an underground area via drill pods. It is also obscenely armored, and provides all the protection and systems you would expect out of a refitted mining vehicle. It also has numerous sensors to detect ground composition for thousands of meters, and is also able to detect traps and explosives in its path to alert others. It sports a single chain gun for protection, but you can easily modify it to become a bastion of firepower."
400 CP,Meditation Sphere ,Generic Star Wars Fanfiction,"Now this is a strange looking starship, looking something like a floating eye with sails on it. This ship doesn’t look all that powerful at first but, unsurprisingly, looks can be deceiving. This ancient (depending on your time period) ship is perhaps one of the most dangerous creations of the ancient Sith Empire: within it is a Sith Meditation Chamber which once entered allows the abilities and powers of the user to be greatly amplified, enough so that mere illusions could become like a vast armada and act as physical beings able to interact with the world, and this is over great distances on a galactic scale. The ship also is equipped with laser cannons and a magnetic accelerator, meaning that depending on the period an upgrade may be needed. You also have one final guarantee: that this one can’t be dominated by a sufficiently powerful force user like Ship was by Abeloth."
400 CP,Runabout ,Star Trek - TNG & DS9,"A small warp-capable ship slightly larger than a shuttle. It comes equipped with a living quarters, a food replicator, a transporter, 4 phaser arrays, a torpedo launcher, and deflector shields. This is should be able to keep you safe against bandits and pirates, but it'll be almost completely useless against a military ship. You hold all the necessary documents to prove you own this vessel, and you'll be able to fly it regardless of your piloting experience. "
