0 CP,Psychic Nullifier,Fallout Mutants,"A strange headpiece with a chin strap to hold it in place. When wearing this, you will find your psychic abilities weakened or nullified, depending on what you need at the moment. It’s quite useful for those who have difficulty with controlling their abilities."
100 CP,Ashen Skull,Imperium Nihilus ,"You’ve heard of the Halo Devices, you’ve heard of the Halo Stars, and so I’m sure that you’ve surmised that those things are far from the only treasures and horrors to be found in within those dark and terrifying reaches of the galaxy. Take this skull for example. One of many rare relics found within the Halo Stars, skulls like these were said to be a potent form of protection against the many dangers of the Immaterium. And it seems that such sayings ring true. So long as the preserved skull of one of the Black Priests of Maccabeus lies in your possession, your soul shall be strengthened, shielding you from psychic powers and unnatural mental influence. It is not a perfect defense, but it doesn’t have to be. After all, besides sheltering your soul, the ashen skull shall give you insight on those who assault you in such ways, telling you of their nature, their location, their intent and perhaps, even their very thoughts, the ones they keep on the surface of their mind."
100 CP,Babel Fish,Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy,This is a small fish that goes in your ear. It can convert any spoken language into something you can understand. It looks like a goldfish and is so staggeringly useful that it (probably) disproves the existence of god. You get a breeding pair.
100 CP,Better Criticals,Fallout Mutants,"You've got some talent with manipulating chance itself, though granted it isn't much right now. This manifests as you landing those lucky hits much more often than normal, which end up helping you greatly in fights. Maybe you manage to hit their elbow on their dominant arm, or manage a shot that unveils a robot's power source, or maybe you just end up hitting them through the eye and into the brain."
100 CP,Blaster Manipulation,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"Who brings a sword to a gunfight? Someone who can ignore bullets. You may now use the Force to deflect or even halt blaster bolts in midair, nullifying the ranged weapons of your enemies. Once a bolt is frozen, it requires minimal concentration to keep suspended, though if you walk away it will continue on it’s path. This power is less effective on kinetic projectiles and non-energy based weaponry, but dedicated practice may change that."
100 CP,Body of the Force,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"Tapping into the cosmic energy field carries some pretty awesome fringe benefits. Suffused with the power of the Force, your body can accomplish great feats of strength and speed. Your reaction time reflects your universal awareness, allowing you to dodge blaster fire and counter expert opponents. Your physical capabilities now edge slightly beyond the greatest potential of your species, making you truly supernatural. Even greater feats may be achieved when coupled with your other powers, such as using telekinesis to leap great heights."
100 CP,Brain Power,Warhammer 40k - Tyranids,"Psykers in this world rarely enjoy the use of their powers and for Tyranids it is even worse. To channel the psychic force of the hivemind through a single mind, it’s no wonder the damage and even death that the Zoanthropes and other psychic organisms often undergo when pushed too far. You are not immune to this force but you do find yourself with a certain degree of protection. Your mental functions and abilities, whether long nights of waiting in ambush in total focus or the use of psychic powers, will never fatigue you or cause you pain, though you will suffer the end results eventually. No matter how you use your mind, you will always be free of headaches, migraines and loss of focus. You can eventually fall unconscious from lack of energy or even die from using too much psionic power but until that point your performance will not be negatively affected. You are also aware of how much fatigue and pain you should be feeling, even as you bypass the effects of it."
100 CP,Emperor’s Tarot ,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade,"Although the Emperor lies upon the Golden Throne for the good of all Humanity, there are times when his voice must reach you to ensure the survival of his people. Fortunately, this deck will ensure his voice will never waver. A pack of seventy-eight psycho- active liquid-crystal wafers, the cards are often used as a form of divination to hear what the Emperor has to say in this grim, dark future. The deck is even linked to his thoughts, and so when you do a reading you are peering into his grand vision to see what dangers may be approaching you. In times of peace, they are also excellent tools for a card game."
100 CP,Force Barrier ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"The Force barrier is a simple, but incredibly useful power. This ability allows the user to generate a shield of pure Force energy around their bodies. This shield is capable of protecting you from various amounts of damage based on the strength of the user. For example a youngling could probably block one blaster bolt, but Yoda could block a blast from the main gun of a heavy tank.
"
100 CP,Force Weapon ,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade,"The power of the Psyker is deadly indeed, even before the training that must take place to hone their abilities. A Psyker with a Force Weapon to attune their psychic prowess and use it as an extension of their powers are tremendously more dangerous as a result. Using a Force Weapon can act as a conduit for one’s powers, allowing them to focus and channel their powers to strike even the mightiest of foes with force unheard of... and this is not including how much more effective it is on supernatural entities such as Daemons."
100 CP,Forecast ,Fallout Mutants,"One of the more common abilities that Psykers possess, should such a term be used for them, is that known as the Sight. With this, you are capable of getting glimpses into the future, often in vague yet helpful forms. You could improve this for a time through the use of chems, but then you'd run the risk of addiction. Still, that would be but a small price to pay to gaze upon the currents of time."
100 CP,Fortune’s Favor,Imperium Nihilus ,"For psykers, especially those lower on the totem pole of power, one of the many ways their powers will manifest is through luck. Be it a good hand in a game of cards or a fortunate find somewhere within the labyrinthine hive cities, psykers are generally luckier than most folk, at least when it comes to more trivial matters. You on the other hand? You take it to a whole new level. While you may not be luckier than most, what you can do is share that luck around, bestowing it upon your allies. As everyone knows, even a little bit of luck can be enough to turn the tides and the more powerful you become, the more of your allies you can bestow your fortune upon."
100 CP,Lightsaber ,Star Wars – Darth Plagueis,"The traditional weapon of the Sith and Jedi, lightsabers are weighty handles that emit a blade of superheated plasma in a magnetic containment field. This ‘blade’ is circular and its cut is omnidirectional, able to instantly sear through most materials in the galaxy in an instant and slowly melt through the few heat resistant enough to bare their edge. That magnetic fields makes the lightsaber a surprisingly versatile weapon, for it repels the ubiquitous blaster weapons used by most sapients and when used in conjunction with the prophetic powers of a Sith Lord the weapon can intercept and redirect ranged fire back at an attacker. As a Sith you have constructed your own lightsaber, with an artificial crystal in its hilt that produces the distinctive crimson blade favoured by your order, and have at least enough competence with it to use it in battle without injuring yourself."
100 CP,Mind Flash ,Destroy All Humans,"Temporarily paralyzes any nearby people, rendering them vulnerable for a short time."
100 CP,Psi-Lance,XCOM - Enemy Unknown,"A bolt of pure, destructive psionic energy. This does tremendous damage, even more to targets with a low willpower. Can work on robots."
100 CP,Psychic Hood,Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes,"The Psychic Hood is an ancient device, dating back to the Great Crusade. Consisting of a set of crystals set into a metallic hood, it both amplifies a user’s own powers as well as helping to nullify the effect of other Psykers upon the Warp, although the defense it provides is not perfect."
100 CP,Second Sight ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"The first power developed by most Squats, long before they are considered an Ancestor. You can see through the illusions and sorcerous stealth favored by your enemies, Slaaneshi and Tzeenchians in particular, and your dreams sometimes contain portents of things to come, or notable events in history. After this Jump, this applies to similar illusions and invisibility."
100 CP,Soulblade ,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"Ancient close combat weapons channeling the power of the world spirits, Soulblades cleave easily through any armor."
100 CP,Witchblade,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"No, not the fancy glove, that’s only in comic books. This psychically attuned sword
serves as a focus of your psychic powers, enhancing your physical might and letting you cleave tanks in two and split Terminator armor with ease."
150 CP,Psyker,"Warhammer 40,000 - Space Marines","You are a psyker, capable of using psychic powers born from your connection to the Warp; however, such powers are dangerous, and there is always risk of being possessed by an entity of Chaos, or even having your own skull turned into a portal to the Warp. In future settings, you will experience no danger from your psychic powers, and you will still be able to use them despite the Warp not existing in other settings.
"
200 CP,All the Voices in Your Head,Star Wars - Sequel Triology,"Do Jedi really die projecting themselves? No wonder the Sith are so much cooler, they don’t have to worry about such small problems. No matter how far, on how many, or for how long you’re attempting to use your abilities, whether telekinesis, astral projection, or telepathy, it won’t cost more than the normal action would just for a short amount of time. Meaning you could snap someone’s neck through a holo video even if they’re a galaxy away, puppet a clone from your pleasure planet, or troll some kid through telepathy while you’re not even there. If it wouldn’t be too much for you to do once in person, you can do it at any distance, for as long as you feel like it to as many people as you can either see or sense. After all it wouldn’t do for you to just... Die while trolling your nephew."
200 CP,Dark Saber,The Mandalorian,"Because it really just isn't star wars without a lightsaber this Lightsaber was forged by the only Mandalorian Jedi, it's known for its blocky hilt and black angular blade that looks more like a traditional sword than a normal Lightsaber, traditionally held by the leader of the Mandalorian people
"
200 CP,Empath ,Babylon 5 - Crusade,"While most telepathy focuses on reading and controlling thought, empaths are able to alter emotion. Where telepaths require extensive mental probing and rewrites to convince someone they are best friends, an empath can do so with just a word. Through subtle manipulation, the suggestions of empaths are hard to resist."
200 CP,Force Blade,Warhammer 40k - Freelancer,"In the hands of most people this would be a normal, if rather elegant, blade. But in the hands of a psyker this becomes a powerful focus, channeling the user’s power into every swing."
200 CP,Force Speak,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"By connecting all life, the Force can serve as a conduit for communication, regardless of distance. With this power, you now speak into the mind of someone you are familiar with. You must have met your target individual before to familiarize yourself with their Force presence, and the deeper your understanding of this individual, the farther you can reach with this power. A passing acquaintance could be reached from any point on the same planet, while a close friend or family member might be contacted from across the galaxy. Your target is guaranteed to understand you, even if you don’t share a language, and you may communicate images and even real-time visions of yourself with practice."
200 CP,Holocron,Star Wars – Dark Empire,"Perhaps you wish to leave a legacy behind? Or simply create an archive of your knowledge of the Force. Regardless this empty holocron can serve either purpose, as you gather knowledge, this cubical or pyramidal storage device records it within itself unless you command it not to. Once accessed a holographic version of yourself will greet you and act as a guide for the device allowing you to easily find anything you wish inside. Finally, while you can access it freely others must either have your permission to access it or for you to have allowed it to open to any it deems ‘worthy’ by a set of rules based on your beliefs, etc.  
"
200 CP,Kyber Crystal Mine,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40K,"Kyber crystals are one of the main components required to construct a lightsaber. These crystals grow on various planets across the galaxy and are attuned to the Force. This mine is filled with kyber crystals that can be harvested to produce lightsabers. This mine will always contain more crystals allowing you to easily supply your own force with lightsabers.
"
200 CP,Legacy Lightsaber,Star Wars - Sequel Trilogy,"A lightsaber from a past Jedi or Sith. Whether Mace Windu’s old Lightsaber, Vader’s own weapon, or Obi-Wan’s. How do you have it? That’s a story for another time. All that you need to know is that sometimes when you touch it in a non combat situation, or when it wouldn't kill you, you can get Force visions of past events in the universe you’re in. They’re fractured, but they’ll give you some insight into the important people around, reveal great secrets, or just clear up some confusion. Easily fixable, even when it’s completely trashed."
200 CP,Meditation Chamber,Star Wars - Darth Bane,"Both the Jedi and the Sith seem to share a love of meditating. The particularities of how they do it vary yes, but it’s well known that immersing oneself in the Force when alone has a plethora of benefits associated with it. This is your meditation chamber, a room for solitude and reflection. Mediation here brings with it great clarity of thought and the necessary rest sleep would otherwise bring to you."
200 CP,Mind Intrusion,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"A darker application of the Force’s connection, wielders of this power may pierce the minds of those nearby to retrieve information, relive memories, or simply erode their mental faculties. This power requires you to be in the same room as your target, and will cause them significant pain if resisted. Those with strong wills may resist this effect, and might even reverse the connection, glancing into your mind instead. Better make sure they’re not more powerful than you."
200 CP,Psi-blast,Destroy All Humans,"A unique ability only known to be used by the human Psi-mutants, this power unleashes a directed psi energy blast that temporarily disables the target's psi abilities as well as knocking them back and inflicting a small amount of damage. You can also unleash a smaller ranged omnidirectional blast centered on yourself."
200 CP,Psionic Boosters,Warhammer 40k - Black Crusade 2,"And yet, that fire could be more than just that. You might be the one who carries the embers, but the power of science is enough that one could turn it into an inferno. Controlling it is another matter, but the additional power is nothing to scoff at. The Tech-Priests, nervous as they are with such things, will nonetheless acquiesce and install these internal crystalline machines within your armor to aid in channeling and augmenting your psionic prowess to a noticeable level than you are used to. Hopefully you will not be consumed by your own power, for it would be a shame after seeing how much stronger your psionics are with this upgrade."
200 CP,Psycannon,Imperium Nihilus ,"The Psycannon is the perfect bolter for any Inquisitor expecting to battle against psykers, daemons and heretics. Lined with silver and inscribed with anti-daemonic symbols, every bolt fired from a Psycannon is one impregnated with negative psychic energy. Beyond being even more damaging to those touched by the Immaterium or born from it, it shall also deliver a devastating blow to their psyches. To be struck by a Psycannon’s bolts is to find oneself frayed apart at the seams, the negative psychic energy tearing apart their mind, body and soul. It is no wonder that weapons like these are a personal favorite of many in the Ordo Malleus and the Grey Knights."
200 CP,Psychic Locus,Warhammer 40k - Grey Knights,"Your presence on the battlefield now serves as a powerful amplifier for the psychic might of your fellow Grey Knights. With your elevated status and mastery over psychic energies, any psychic ability cast by you or your battle-brothers is now enhanced, with its effective range doubled. This increase in range allows your forces to reach enemies or allies who would otherwise be out of range, enabling more strategic use of powers like teleportation, smite, or other psychic attacks and buffs. This enhancement not only magnifies your personal influence but also strengthens the entire squad's combat effectiveness, making your presence a force multiplier in every engagement."
200 CP,Psychic Paper,Doctor Who,"Ah, now this is a bit more tricky. You now have a notebook’s worth of Psychic Paper, a Time Lord device that can tap the mental impressions of the reader to make him see an illusion of whatever
document they’ve been told to expect seeing. Very handy for convincing people you really do have valid identification, or signed permission to be let in the building, or a contract as the latest consultant to their secret project, or whatever else you can think of. It doesn’t matter how many sheets of paper you tear out of your notebook, it will always have more. Even works on electronics... somehow. Exactly where the money comes from when you use it as a Credit Card is unknown, but you can. Unless you start drawing attention, that is. Besides that, this serves in place of biometrics, electric IDs, the lot. Since the Psychic Paper has to be able to read the subject’s mind in order to pull off the illusion, people who are particularly strong-willed or highly intelligent or possess sufficient psionic defenses can potentially see through it. Still, it should work handily enough on the vast majority of everyone you could reasonably expect to encounter."
200 CP,Pyromancy,Imperium Nihilus ,"It is fire that has been mankind’s greatest tool. It is fire that has seen them rise above the myriad beasts and creatures of ancient Terra and it is fire that has taken humanity to the stars. And so, even the greatest of psykers must acknowledge the gift of the flame. And so too shall your foes. With the might of Pyromancy, rarely will you ever be caught lacking in firepower. It may be a simple thing but for Pyromancers of the greatest kind, the flames they bring forth shall cast ablaze entire worlds with the blazing heat of a roaring star."
200 CP,Pyromaniac,Fallout Mutants,"You may be crazy about fire, or maybe just plain crazy in general, but that won’t change what you’re capable of now, will it? You possess the ability of pyrokinesis, capable of conjuring and controlling flames to burn your enemies on par with a military-grade flamethrower. You could dial this back, making just enough fire to light a cigarette, but where’s the fun in that?"
200 CP,Spirit Stone,Generic Warhammer 40k,"A Spirit Stone, also known as a Waystone, Dreamstone and a Tear of Isha, is a small, seemingly precious gem carried in a variety of different aesthetically-pleasing settings on a Craftworld Aeldari's chest, used to save their souls from consumption after death within the Immaterium by Slaanesh. It works like a horcrux and holds your soul on death. This soul stone will work regardless of what race you are. It will also give you an opportunity to undergo rebirth if you have enough time and the ability to do so. You also will be given the blueprints needed to create a Spirit Stone for any race out of mundane materials.
"
200 CP,Umbramancy ,Imperium Nihilus ,"Fire may have been mankind’s oldest ally, but it was the darkness and those that lurked within that humanity knew and feared above all else in those primal days. And as the ages have gone, this fear has never truly left. It is always there, lurking deep within, waiting to come bubbling up to the surface once more. Now, in this tumultuous time, fear of the dark and of the unknown grips at the hearts of men everywhere you go. Yet, there is wisdom to be found in embracing your fears and in doing so, learning to use the darkness against your foes. A specialty of the Raven Guard Space Marines, Umbramancy is a unique and useful discipline of psychic abilities. For starters, novices in the art will start off being able to cloak themselves in darkness, shielding them from the sights of their enemies and letting them pull off ambushes worthy of any Raven Guard. But as the Umbramancer grows in both power and skill, they will be capable of so much more. From enveloping foes in a veil of darkness to drowning them within a shadow whirlpool to turning even their own shadows against them, the enemies of an Umbramancer shall learn to fear the dark once more, no matter who they may be."
200 CP,Webway Seeds ,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"A bag of twenty-six wraithbone seeds, replenished monthly. When planted, they grow overnight into a webway gate large enough for people to pass through. The visible growth is just a fraction of the true expansion into the twilight between the Materium and Immaterium, linking up with the existing Webway. If you do not define an area, it will continue expand to a scale to move vehicles, armies and starships. In future Jumps, you can use this to build your own Webway network. "
200 CP,Force Sensitivity,Star Wars - Dark Empire,"Not everyone can claim to be a favored child of the force, but you can. At base this is a level equal to the standard affinity of a Jedi affinity; nothing impressive compared to the greats of the galaxy, but still something."
300 CP,Ardent Blade,Adepta Sororitas,"A powerful weapon wielded by one of the founding saints of the Sororitas. Blessed by the Emperor's vengeance, this weapon is more effective against abominations and daemons. The power of the Astronomican builds up in it periodically and can be released in a wave of purifying fire that burns those untouched by the emperor's light."
300 CP,Electrifying ,Fallout Mutants,"Well, this is certainly a shocking turn of events, finding out you are capable of this. You are now capable of conjuring and controlling electricity, allowing you to fire off lightning bolts at anyone who gets in your way. Not only is this useful for fighting enemies or charging whatever machine you’re working on, but you can also release an electromagnetic pulse, one that is especially harmful to robotic enemies and those wearing power armor."
300 CP,Gollop Chamber,XCOM - Enemy Unknown,"The Ethereals themselves utilize a psychic network. This chamber allows you to access it, for those who want to try and skip to the end, and also serves broadly as a psychic enhancer."
300 CP,Psychestone,Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar,"While a Seer's knowledge of the future is vital, visions are not always clear. In this respect, the Psychestone acts as something of a lens, through which the Seer in question – usually a Farseer – gains a clearer picture of things to come than they otherwise would."
300 CP,Soul Globe,Babylon 5,"A secretive and much loathed race refered to as Soul Hunters prowl the galaxy, waiting till exemplars begin to die, seeking out and trapping the souls of the best and the brightest, the special ones. Leaders, thinkers, poets, dreamers and blessed lunatics. You have managed to come into posession of one ofthese orbs and within lies the consciousness of a great hero. Under their tutelage you will easily become a master strategist, capable of commanding fleets and armies as easily as you draw breath. Beware though, the race of the hero whos soul you hold will not look favourably on this."
400 CP,A Deck of Cards ,Imperium Nihilus ,"At end of the 41st Millennium, a sorcerer of the Thousand Sons was captured and interrogated by the Inquisition. While the ultimate fate of the sorcerer is in question, the Inquisition did find many of the sorcerer’s possessions worth examining. And much like the sorcerer, the whereabouts of these possessions are a mystery, leaving the Inquisition forced to instead replicate such relics to the best of their capabilities. Somehow, it seems that fortune once again shines upon you for you find yourself in possession of one of these Inquisitorial replicates, one that might prove to be the most powerful amongst them. Appearing to be a never-ending set of tarot cards, each one harkening back to a time when Terra was still young and green, each of these cards holds a special power. By defeating a foe—lethally or otherwise, so long as their soul remains—these cards shall glow with an otherworldly power. This marks the perfect opportunity to use the card’s unique properties. Through a ritual, one you shall instinctually know so long as the cards are in your possession, you may bind the souls of others into one of these cards. Once bound, you may call upon these foes, summoning them onto the field, to assist you in battle. Whether it is to slaughter your foes or to aid your allies, it matters not. What matters is that so long as they are summoned, your foes shall heed and obey your commands, both the letter and the spirit. There is no risk of them working against you for as long as they are bound."
400 CP,As A Fine Wine ,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"All Squats grow in psychic potential and power with age, you just do so twice as quickly and without apparent limits. This applies equally to all your other powers and skills."
400 CP,Astral Projection,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"If you can send a message across great distances, what’s stopping you from sending an object, or  ourself? By putting your body into a meditative state, you may project the hyper-realistic image of yourself or other objects to places half a galaxy away. You may also transfer small physical objects between one point and another, though this must occur over drastically shorter ranges (roughly a mile), and the person receiving the object must also be attuned to the Force in some way."
400 CP,Daemon Weapon,Emperor's Children Gauntlet,"A melee weapon crafted using a Greater Daemon of Slaanesh, in addition to being far superior to a normal weapon it will corrupt anyone around you eventually converting them into your faithful servants. This is guaranteed NOT to corrupt you any corruption you incur in this world will be your own doing."
400 CP,Dagger of Mortis ,Star Wars vs Warhammer 40k,"The Dagger of Mortis is a mystical weapon held on the altar of Mortis. This weapon was hidden by the Father due to its ability to kill any being including the Celestials. That is the most powerful ability possessed by the dagger. Any being that is struck by a lethal blow will die. Any immortality they possess will be stripped away and any unique methods of defense will be bypassed. 
"
400 CP,Force Lightning,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"The power made famous by the Emperor himself is now yours to take. You may draw on the energy of the Force to conjure bolts of lightning from your fingers. These surges are very powerful and deadly, capable of killing almost anyone in a few short seconds of agonizing pain. Only other masters of the Force or those with special defenses against energy attacks can withstand these attacks. Be warned that this power can be reflected by said opponents, and you have no special immunity to its destructive power. Even still, a fully realized master of this power could clear an average room in a few heartbeats. Your enemies underestimate you at their own peril."
400 CP,Force Sever,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"The Jedi, the Sith, and all those in between all rely on their connection to the Force to grant them their powers. Using this ability to disrupt that connection would sever their powers and leave them as mundane as someone not sensitive to the Force. This technique requires you to seal your target within a spiritual prison, meaning it is ineffective against opponents more powerful than you. Still, is it not the Jedi way to spare your opponent, in the hopes they might repent?"
400 CP,Infinity Circuit ,Generic Warhammer 40k ,"An Infinity Circuit is the psychoactive matrix at the heart of each Aeldari Craftworld. These matrices house the souls of the fallen Eldar and give their guidance to the living. Purchasing this will grant you an infinity circuit that contains the souls of many fallen Aeldari including warriors, craftsmen, and a variety of others. These will be willing to provide you with all of the knowledge they possess and should you have wraith constructs be willing to take command of them to assist you in battle. This circuit can also protect any Eldar that are with you from Slaanesh as long as you bring their soul stones here. In addition any willing souls can be stored in the circuit such as those contained in a soul stone. This can include any race or type of being as long as they are willing.
"
400 CP,Life Giver ,Fallout Mutants,"In case you haven’t noticed, it is quite difficult for nearly any form of plantlife to grow in the Wasteland, the poisonous radiation having long since ruined any nutrients within the ground. You are sure to change that, though, and you are now capable of conjuring and controlling plantlife, ones that are sure to survive even here. Creating a mighty oak tree is certainly within your capabilities, but restoring life to one ofthe burnt-out husks that dot the wastes is probably going to be a bit easier on you."
400 CP,Lorenzo's Crown,Fallout Mutants,"An artifact that may possess otherworldly origins, it was uncovered by Lorenzo Cabot in the Rub’ al Khali desert in 1894, and has kept him alive all the way until 2287. This piece of headwear will not only halt your aging, making you effectively immortal, but it will also focus and empower any psychic powers you may possess. Even when worn by someone who isn’t a psyker, it will give them a minor telekinetic ability."
400 CP,No mystical energy field controls my destiny,Star Wars Movie Compilation - The Skywalker Saga,"You can toggle this perk in order for you to become a blank spot in fate hiding you from any form of precognition or prophecies.
"
400 CP,Pariah,Warhammer 40k - Squats,"Well, well, it seems not all Squats are psychic after all. You are so non-psychic, you loop into anti-psychic. Psykers and daemons can’t affect you, and tend to freak out when they get too close. Your touch burns things of the Warp."
400 CP,Psychic,Farscape,"You have access to psychic powers. At first you can only take pain away from others and onto yourself, but with practice you'll soon find yourself able to share unity (essentially the Vulcan mind meld) with others or even kill people with your brain. These powers are mostly limited to affecting things with some form of psychic or spiritual energy, so don't expect it to work on robots or to ever perform telekinesis. You can also use these powers on energy beings, ghosts, or similar psionic or spiritual entities."
400 CP,Runestones of Jarankyor ,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"Special psychestones used by one of the greatest Farseers of past millennia. These enhance the clarity of precognition so much that anyone can see visions of the future in the stones, and a Farseer can parse an order of magnitude more futures, faster than ever."
400 CP,Sceptre of Marko Ragnos,Star Wars - New Jedi Order,"A large rod with the unique power to drain the Force from areas, shoot it as powerful laser beams or
infuse it into new targets. With enough energy, you could raise the dead, or make a force-user of an ordinary sapient. Perhaps with time and study you may learn to strip the unworthy of the Force with it."
400 CP,Temporal Fist ,Destroy All Humans,Freezes time for everyone but the user for a short period. The user can still use other powers in this state.
400 CP,The Doom of Jumper,Warhammer 40k - Tyranids,"The raw psychic power that courses through your mind has now imbued itself into your very body whilst your physical form has now strengthened your mind considerably. Your physical power and your psychic power are now linked to each other, rising and falling as the other does so. The more power you gain in one category, even if only a temporary boost, the more power you will gain in the other. Psychic energy will cause your body to grow stronger, faster and tougher whilst increasing your physical forms capabilities will increase the power, speed and tenacity of your mental abilities."
400 CP,Tithe of Souls,Warhammer 40k - The Warp,"Hungry, are we? Within this glass vial rests thousands of high quality (psyker grade), non-sentient souls for either your consumption or as currency and fuel/reagents for other purposes. This vial restores itself once every week after being emptied or damaged/destroyed"
400 CP,Unlimited Potential,Destroy All Humans,"By purchasing this you have unlimited growth potential for your psionic powers, with practice you can break the limits of the powers mentioned here, increase your psi energy capacity and can learn new psionic powers in"
400 CP,Webway Gate ,Planetary Governor,"A rare and highly valuable structure opens a portal into the mythical Webway, a network of tunnels and portals in a dimension that lies parallel to the realms of matter and madness. This allows for near-instantaneous interstellar travel, as the kilometres-wide toroidal structure can accommodate even the largest of vessels. This ancient alien technology is highly sought after by various factions, including the Imperium, Eldar, and Dark Eldar, and its possession can provide a significant strategic advantage
"
400 CP,Zoanthropy,Warhammer 40k - Tyranids,"You’ve become a Zoanthrope, of sorts. All the incredible psychic power of a Zoanthrope is yours to command, though you do not need to take on the body of a Zoanthrope unless you wish to do so. Every Zoanthrope is a mighty psyker, capable of tearing through large sections of whole armies on their own, though natural Zoanthropes are limited by needing to devote almost all their brainpower to controlling their own power. You do not have this limitation. In fact, you not only find controlling your own psychic powers to be quite easy and natural, you also won’t find yourself harmed by overuse of psychic energy. If you ever reach a point where you would channel too much psionic force at once, it will simply slip harmlessly away from your mind, though it is possible to override this."
500 CP,Primaris Psyker,Imperial Guard Jumpchain,"To channel the raw power of the Immaterium is something truly harrowing, as even the slightest mistake can spell damnation (or worse!). Yet those battle-psykers who survive their regular brushes with the raw power of the Warp can grow ever stronger than before, until they are recognised as Primaris Psykers, among the most potent human psykers available to the Imperial Guard. You are one of them, your long experience in mastering the Warp boosting your psyker rating to Gamma and allowing your psychic powers to grow ever more potent the more you use them, allowing you to unlock further refinements and learn new disciplines with which you can use your powers.

500 CP,Teach Me,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"When you’re playing with phenomenal powers, perks are no substitute for a true master. While most castaways lack the connections to find teachers, you don’t have that problem. Whether you’re training with a new power, navigating a new locale, or just trying to get a grasp on the situation, you’ll never be far from someone who can show you the ropes."
600 CP,Bloodline of Power,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"Whether you’re a Palpatine, a Skywalker, or are the start of your own dynasty, you have a deep reservoir of power at your disposal. Force Users will have the potential to one day challenge the Emperor himself, while pilots and soldiers would “merely” become legendary inspirations to their factions. Whatever your path, you will blaze a trail. You’ll grow faster in strength and skill than even you could expect. Whatever you’re good at, you’re going to be the best. Soon you’ll be a master yourself, combining powers and techniques you can only dream of."
600 CP,Darth Andeddu’s Writings,Star Wars - Darth Bane,"Darth Andeddu was one of the few figures in history to have mastered the technique of Essence
Transferal. This technique allows one to persist past their corporeal form and take the bodies of others for their own. Unlike what one may find in the tomb on Prakith, these detail a whole new level of Essence Transferal for he or she who would take this route to immortality. Unfortunately for most, transferring such vast amounts of Dark power to a new body causes it to rapidly degrade and forces them to move on or risk being consigned to The Void. With this purchase, you need not worry about such an eventuality. You may perfectly transfer yourself to a new host body, maintaining it and all your abilities perfectly for as long as you’d otherwise naturally live."
600 CP,Force Storm,Star Wars Sequel Trilogy V1.1,"Where others wield the lightning bolt, you wield the thunderstorm. This powerful display allows you to cast a wide field of disruptive electrical energy all around you. Even when wielded by a novice, this power would swallow small villages whole. If you were an ancient master fueled by vast reserves of power, you could disrupt entire fleets of warships. You are no longer a singular being, Jumper. Now, you are a force of nature."
600 CP,Hive Mind,Fallout Mutants,"Have you ever looked at someone and wondered, ‘what is going on inside their head?’ Well wonder no more, as you are a very potent telepath, capable of reading minds and communicating with others through your thoughts alone. You can use this to sense the minds of anyone nearby, eliminating stealth from biological opponents, but the most important ability offered by this is being able to create telepathic links. When you forge these links, it will allow you to communicate as though they are right next to you no matter how far away."
600 CP,Hoktar ,Stargate Atlantis,"You’re not an Ascended, but you’re closer than most. You find yourself gifted with ""weak"" psychic abilities such as telepathy, psychokinesis, clairvoyance, technopathy, regeneration, healing, etc, which you can develop and refine with sufficient time and practice. What you get is much more versatility than power – by comic book standards you’re only street tier – but entire alien species in this universe have successfully pretended to be gods with less."
600 CP,Invisible Hand,Fallout Mutants,"When one thinks of psychic powers, they will inevitably turn towards moving objects without even touching them. This is for many reasons, such as how obvious a psychic display it is, but it is also due to just how versatile telekinesis really is. Though you could lift a person into the air and crush them with relative ease, you could also use it for many other tasks, such as picking a lock without any bobby pins or repositioning your weapons in the air in order to get a better angle of attack. With practice and experience, there are many options open to you when you possess this power."
600 CP,Psy-Tech,Fallout Mutants,"It is only to be expected that when mankind learned of the existence of psychic powers, that they would turn to technology to study it, and then enhance it. You are one of the very few people who are capable of creating tech meant to enhance and mimic psychic powers. From headwear that can nullify or improve their potency, to guns using telekinetic energy to lift and move heavy objects. You could also use this to upgrade or create a variant of power armor that links with the brain itself, allowing for more fluid movement and better control. When the supernatural and science work in tandem, the possibilities are endless."
600 CP,Shadow in the Warp,Warhammer 40k - Tyranids,"One of the most feared attributes of the Hive Fleets is the phenomenon known as the Shadow of the Warp. The Tyranid’s as a collective have such an immense psychic force that they mute the warp around them, preventing it or psychic powers or transmissions from taking place. This not only blocks off warp travel but also isolates planets from communicating with other worlds and neuters psychic opponents. You have a personalised variant of this, even when unconnected from the hivemind that allows you to massively weaken or even nullify if weak enough, any psychics or similar power users in your area. Your aura’s range is enough to cover a large battlefield and you can even severely weaken beings who are innately connected to the warp or similar places within your aura."
600 CP,The Shadowlight ,"Warhammer 40k: Ciaphas Cain, Hero of the Imperium","The Shadowlight is a powerful xeno artifact created by a race known as the Ancients. It was originally meant to be a powerful weapon meant to be used against the C’tan, but was destroyed. Despite this the relic is still incredibly powerful because of a side effect that it causes. Prolonged contact with the artifact can awaken psyker abilities in any individual and can increase the power of a psyker. This acts as both a passive and active boost. Meaning that slowly over time you will become stronger and while you are holding it your abilities will be boosted immensely."
600 CP,The Soul Devourer,Warhammer 40k - Tyranids,"In the past, you got the chance to feed on the very heart of an Eldar craftworld. All those souls, they gave you strength. You fed and fed until you could eat no more and you gained a shocking amount of power, whether you destroyed the world in your feeding or not. Your psionic abilities are enough to tear battleships in two or render a titan into slag and, as long as you continue to feed on souls, they will continue to grow. Souls give you power, permanently increasing your psychic strength just a little for every one you eat and with all the food on offer to you, you could eat a lot of souls in the near future."
800 CP,Relic of Khaine ,Warhamer 40k - The Ynnari,"In the Fall, even resilient Kaela Mensha (Bloody-Handed) Khaine reached his endurance’s limit and fled, shattering into a thousand pieces as crossed the barrier into the material universe. These pieces were collected by the Eldar, nurtured in the heart of each Craftworld’s Infinity Circuit. Each year, a Young King is selected who in times war or crisis enters the relic’s chamber. Minutes or hours later, a scream is heard and the Avatar of Khaine emerges. Once a year, you or an ally can merge with this relic, a devotional statue, and for just one day experience the awesome power of the towering God of War and Murder."
