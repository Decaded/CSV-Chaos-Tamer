1,Free,Bodly Foundations,Toriko,Bloodline,Your body holds genetic foundations that make it incredibly compatible with Gourmet Cells. Your physique and stature have improved substantially. 
2,Free,Basic Gourmet Cells,Toriko,Bloodline,"Everything in the Toriko Universe has Gourmet Cells. Here Jumpers can determine what type of Gourmet Cells they start with. They can choose from:
“Red” Gourmet Cells
“Blue” Gourmet Cells
“Green” Gourmet Cells
*“Red” allows an easier time to manipulate Appetite Energy and mutations, but to reach some levels of strength shown in setting, they have to train; “Blue” grants greater power at the beginning, but less control over it and Appetite Demon can have totally opposed personality; “Green” ones in terms of strength are on “Red” but grant positive results when users acquire plant transplants,

3,Free,Dark One,Feng Shen Ji,Bloodline,"These are the oppressed humanoids, exiled to live in the Underworld over a 100,000 years ago. They have pointy ears, onyx/gray skin, green eyes, and have a similar lifespan if not a little more than Humans (but even a child would be able to compete against the average Human soldier). To the uneducated they essentially look like dark elves with shorter ears. The average Dark One’s physical abilities match peak level Human capabilities once they mature as a base line."
4,Free,Shinigami,Bleach,Bloodline,"Those who guide souls from this world to the next and protect the cycle of reincarnation. The
Shinigami are gods of death, human spirits who take up the ceaseless battle for the souls of mankind
against Hollows, Quincy and all other dark threats to the innocent. Or so they say. A Shinigami is nothing more than an above-average human soul who has bonded with an Asauchi, a
blank vessel in the shape of a sword that was forged through the combination of many empty souls.

Yet that bond brings them great power, as the sword unlocks the true spiritual potential within their
souls. Over the thousands of years, the Shinigami have established an organisation known as the
Gotei 13, among other factions. Organised into a military force, they now guard the Afterlife and the
Mortal World as they attend to their psychopomp duties. As your primary choice, you become a Plus or human spirit in Soul Society that passed on from the
Mortal World. Having noticed your above average spiritual pressure and thus need to eat, you set
out to train yourself. You will be a new graduate from the Shin’o Academy, where all Shinigami learn
the four core techniques of the Shinigami and are trained for their duties. Zanjutsu, the art of sword
fighting. Hakuda, unarmed combat. Hoho, mobility techniques. Kido, demon magic. You were an
average student, as trained in each art as any unseated Shinigami could claim to be and while your
Asauchi has bonded to you, you have not yet heard it’s call. Perhaps through the fires of battle or
deep introspection, you could make contact with your inner sword.

Note: Only one Bleach race may be purchased without Hybridisation."
5,Free,Exaltation,Generic Exalted,Bloodline,"Choose a type of Exaltation and
any caste that would belong to that type. You are now guaranteed, at some point after your first
year here, to attract that Exaltation to yourself. You can choose Dragon-blooded (not Dynast,
that's a background, not a type of Exaltation) for free, a Celestial version for 100cp, and a
Solaroid version for 300cp. Sounds great right, much cheaper than the background options?
Think again. This means you have zero experience with your Exalted powers, not even starting
on the level of a typical 'player generated' character. You'll have to learn everything from scratch
unless you can somehow find a teacher or mentor to train you (better hope they don't use their
more developed Exalted abilities to mind-fuck you). Keep in mind all those 'starting character'
archetypes from the books had, on average, two or so years of experience with their abilities,
something you won't have.
Additionally when you get your Exaltation it WILL be in a public place and people WILL notice it
happening, there is no way to avoid this."
6,50,Dragon-blood,Generic Exalted,Bloodline,"For 50cp you're one of the Dragonblooded, the children of the
Elemental Dragons. You're particularly focused on group combat and in the days of the
Primordial war served as the foot soldiers of the celestial exalted. Your martial and magical
abilities tend to be greatly enhanced when fighting alongside others of your kind. In comparison
to mortals even the lowest Dragonblood is virtually beyond compare, able to treat with mortal
kings and rulers with little fear of retaliation no matter how disrespectful they act. In comparison
to the other Exalted and comparably strong magical entities however you tend to be towards the
lower end of the totem pole, more of a soldier rather than an officer.
That said it was the dragon-blooded that tore down the Golden Tyrants known as the Solars at
the end of the First Age, so don't discount yourself. A team of Dragon-blooded working together
is far more than the sum of its parts. For 100cp however you can be one of the Dynasts, the
Dragon-blooded whom rule on the Blessed Isle and represent The Realm, who have access to
vast amounts of resources, support, influence, and the obedience of anyone that works for the
Realm that is not themselves a Dynast. Be warned however, Dynasts by default will be
embroiled into the political schemes of the Realm and the various Great Houses, and will likely
have many duties and responsibilities that their outcast (non-Dynast) dragon-blood cousins do
not. If you desire instead of being a Dynast you may instead be a member of one of the five
ruling gentiles of Looks"
7,100,Bloodline ability,Cradle V1,Bloodline,"Having been sired by someone who is so much better than the rest of the world, you have access to a very powerful trait. You can make it anything, but no more powerful than the Akura Clan’s own. The only restriction is that it only truly becomes effective once you reach Underlord. Some guidelines would be Eithan’s omnidirectional vision, or the Akura’s clan’s crystal armor."
8,100,Demi-God,Saint Seiya Omega,Bloodline,"Born from the union of a mortal and a divine being, your existence is marked by
inherent strength surpassing that of ordinary humans. Much like Eden, the son of
Mars, your physical prowess exceeds the norm, endowed with resilience and
power beyond mortal bounds. With divine heritage coursing through your veins,
accessing mentors to guide and train you comes effortlessly, as if destiny itself
beckons you towards the path of mastery.
Moreover, your aptitude for learning is unparalleled, with a mind capable of
absorbing knowledge and skills at an astonishing pace. Whether mastering
combat techniques or delving into the mysteries of Cosmo manipulation, your
accelerated learning curve propels you towards greatness with remarkable
swiftness."
9,100,Devilish Form: Unnatural Monster,Avesta of Black and White,Bloodline,"The Dagravant, and specially the Daeva, often take more monstrous forms that seem to defile the good order of things just by existing. From tentacled monsters as large as hills, to small dragonoids and basically any kind of thing that you may imagine. You may also now create your own form for this jump, following whatever design that you wish for."
10,100,Redshift Jumper ,Tsukihime,Bloodline,"The greatest expression of power isn’t anything as subtle as presence or a mere sense of having moved forward somehow - it’s bright and flashy colors that show you’re not someone to mess with! When you achieve or use any supernatural power of your choosing, you may have your body change in appearance somehow to match it - whether a different hair color, longer hair, a change in skin tone or eye color, or other ‘minor’ changes in appearance. This is purely aesthetic and doesn’t allow full-blown shapeshifting, but you can freely customize when and how these forms appear, as well as change the appearance of similar transformations that don’t change your body very much freely. This can be toggled and adjusted at will.
"
11,100,Beast of Legend,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Bloodline,"In the woods of olden times, strange things roamed. Things that science couldn’t explain yet they
still existed. One of those things might even be what you’ve become now, a beast of folktales and
legends. Taking this grants you a new form, even a transformation from a normal human form if you
want, that turns you into a massive, monstrous version of an animal native to the Americas. A
mighty wolf with a head the size of a man’s body and unnatural speed, a vampiric bat with a
wingspan greater than a house that sucks horses dry of blood in one gulp, an invisible predator with
too many deadly talons and legs or even a murderous duck capable of swallowing people whole. Whatever form is chosen, you gain excellent instincts for using that form in combat or hunting and
most normal people will be unable to put up much resistance, even with basic firearms, against your
might."
12,100,Alchemical Exaltation,Generic Exalted,Bloodline,"You're an Alchemical Exalted instead of one of the other more
'regular' Exalts. Choose what caste you are. Unlike the other options if you purchase this you
start out as an Alchemical Exalted but you're probably the only one currently in Creation so have
fun explaining what the hell you are to the people you meet. You still have no clue how your
abilities work and basically zero idea on how to develop them, so it is going to take you some
time to puzzle things out. Additionally you look like some sort of weird mechanical person and
will definitely stand out basically anywhere and everywhere that you go until and unless you
discover a method to disguise yourself."
13,200,Unknown Biology,Tekken,Bloodline,"Your body is unlike those of puny humans. Diseases won’t have any luck
affecting you in any way, same with poisons of any kind. You can turn this of if you would like to get
drunk for example. You also possess a certain amount of longevity… this could even make you full on
immortal if combined with the Devil Gene somehow according to Heihachi"
14,200,Vampiric,Tekken,Bloodline,"You are a Vampire! You can use dark energy to enhance your attacks and use like
projectiles. Fortunately, you don’t need to worry about your usual Vampire weaknesses like Sun light
and garlic. Adding to that your also all but immortal, unable to die to old age. You start weak but can
strengthen yourself by drinking blood. Drinking the blood of someone with intense spiritual force like
the Archers of Sirius will greatly boost your strength, much better than normal blood. On top of that
you can heal yourself when you sleep."
15,200,Monstrous ,Tekken,Bloodline," You can enter a second stage, far more powerful than your previous one similar to
the mighty Ogre. Entering this form will heal you back to full health (in case a Judo Fighter kicked
your ass and the son of one of your victims wants to fight you still). You will mutate greatly which
boosts your strength and durability and depending on what mutations you get this could affect your
fighting style (for example one arm might gain claws while the other becomes a bundle of snakes and
you can breath fire)."
16,200,Creative Design,Street Fighter,Bloodline,"As previously mentioned there are many strange looking people in this world,
and this is true. Stark white giants among men with arms as long as their torso, the beefiest of
wrestlers covers in dozens of scars, malicious fighters that people swear were demons in human
form and others like them.
 Say you don't wish to disguise an appearance like theirs, but acquire one yourself, this is where
that perk comes in. Upon purchase, you may customize your form with any height, weight and shape
within natural human limits and this will become your new form. Colours may be as weird and wacky
as you like, anything out of the rainbow really.
 You'll be able to keep this appearance no matter how much or how little you train or eat, and
aging is profoundly less intense appearance-wise on this form compared to others."
17,200,Ancient Dark One,Feng Shen Ji,Bloodline,"Four Hundred thousand years ago, the Dark Ones had a completely different 
visage. Standing between 10-15 meters tall, with four arms, and also sporting 
collapsible leather wings to fly with; most likely grown to keep up with their 
enemies the ‘Ancient Gods’ , many of whom could fly as well. Physically these 
behemoths can exert and withstand around 10 tons to match their own physique 
and a flying speed that matches their own running speed. Besides the many 
physical appendages and advantages, the Ancient Dark Ones were also able to 
Spiritze multiple objects at once instead of just a single weapon (able to skip the 
timely process of bonding with their potential Spirit Gear as well as adding 
versatility to their arsenal). 
"
18,200,Gods,Feng Shen Ji,Bloodline,"Say hello to the current rulers of the world! These are creatures that resemble humans, or maybe we resemble them... Either way these humanoids all have blue eyes with black or white hair and can live up to 300 years and no longer visually aging once they hit the prime of their youth. The average God’s physical abilities match peak level Human capabilities once they mature as a base line."
19,200,Sea Devils,Feng Shen Ji,Bloodline,"An additional race option, if the others weren’t to your liking, becoming a giant mermaid. Your size becomes 15 meters in length/height, being able to rival that of a frigate wooden ship. Your hair is made of tentacles, you have goat eyes, as well as your lower half becoming a large fish tail; and yes you can breathe underwater. Additionally you can manipulate water well enough to create whirlpools and tidal waves to capsize ships similar to your size with ease, though you lack the abilities to generate water itself. This counts as an alt-form, even in Jump, since there are only 4 Sea Devils left in the world besides you. You may instantly transform into this Alt-Form, or any other by being engulfed in a pillar of water."
20,200,Mix Blood,Feng Shen Ji,Bloodline,"Upon purchase, you can choose another RACE to purchase to make you a hybrid of your chosen races. Doing so allows you to receive discounts on the newly chosen RACE as well as your original. You also may choose to appear as your originally purchased RACE, or just picking traits you wish to show while retaining all your  innate abilities without any drawbacks (like with Ah Gou’s pupils changing depending on the power he is using at the time). This option can be purchased multiple times and if chosen as the perk for the discount, the discount extends to all purchases. As long as this perk was purchased, you may purchase this at an undiscounted price for future Jumps with the same effects. This will only work with racial origins, or choosing a race Post Jump."
21,200,Fake Heavenly God Technique,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Bloodline,"Just like the
Heavenly God Technique users, you can house more than one
spirit in your Soul Realm, at each rank you gain the capacity for
one more, starting from Silver Rank - meaning that you can
house two spirits at Silver Rank. The maximum amount of spirits
you can house, with this perk alone, is still 7"
22,200,Hybridisation,Bleach,Bloodline,"Spirit particles, for all that they often seem indistinguishable from physical matter in the mortal
world, do not work on the same principles. One of the best examples of this is what happens when
two spiritual species come together as one. The result is not an infertile mutant or weakened cripple
but something quite incredible. There are many kinds of racial hybrids in this world, and many
different ways to make them. Every purchase of this option will let you pick another of the above race options for free. As to the actual races, how you combine is up to you, balancing various benefits and flaws. The most basic is to simply become a natural member of each race at once, having access to all natural
abilities and potential from the start, but with no added power from this hybridisation. Other
options can range wildly. Something like the Vizard, turning one or more of your additional races into a temporary power up, giving a large increase in power and temporary access to some racial abilities, but at the cost of no
access to such powers outside of your brief transformation. These might be unlocked in time, the
tradeoff for an initial benefit.
It’s even possible that your hybridisation might result in a new race taking aspects of both, with new
abilities made from the fusion of both. While the potential and originality can be tempting, you’d
also be left to discover your abilities from the beginning with no one to help, being the first of your
kind. Feel free to get creative but try to keep your choices balanced against these examples. If a choice
has a particular benefit, try to make for a change off elsewhere. There are no limits to how many
races you can hybridise into your mix, beyond the maximum present in the jump.

May be purchased multiple times."
23,200,Red Rage,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Bloodline,"The classic expression of what an Oni is, power and rage and stature to crush any mortal man. Only
the great heroes could stand to these towers beasts, such as what you’ve become. Your body can
transform to an extent now, able to change into an innocent, child-like form without losing your
normal power or increasing your size and musculature to grotesque extents to gain more power, turning into a monster that grows as your magical power does. Beyond this outward expression of
power, you can tap into the same demonic fury that gives Oni like Ibaraki their names, a raging state
that greatly increases your physical power. While initially you retain control, the more you loosen
your hold, the greater the benefit you’ll gain and the more horrendous your appearance becomes."
24,200,Giant Ancestor,A Will Eternal,Bloodline,"The blood of giants flows in you. Your natural form is massive, towering meters over the
smaller humans. Consequently, with more mass and muscle comes a much stronger body
than that of others of equal cultivation to you. In the world of cultivation, only body cultivators
will match you on an equal playing field, and that is if you don’t practise any yourself. Don’t
get cocky though, there are many strange and profound body arts out there, that may
surprise even you."
25,200,Chosen of the Elemental Dragons,Generic Exalted,Bloodline,"You've got Legendary Breeding. Literally. You're the
epitome of what a Dragon-blooded is supposed to be like, and the blood of the Elemental
Dragons flows thick in your veins. This gives you extra Essence to use (though not even
remotely as much as the Abundant Essence perk), extra skill and ability in the use of your
elementally aligned perks and magics (choose one of Wood, Water, Fire, Air, or Earth), and the
guarantee that if any other Dragonblooded realize you have this (which they will if they bother
looking at you for more than a moment) that suitors will be lining up for your hand in marriage. In
fact if you're a Dynast it's an absolute certainty, you'll already have an arranged marriage to a
'suitable' Dragonblooded wife/husband (whom may be a companion if you buy that option) and
be expected to make lots of babies. Lots of babies. What nobody besides you knows however is
that your Legendary Breeding is inheritable.
All children you have are guaranteed to Exalt at some point around their 7th birthday as a
Dragonblood of a random elemental type and they too will have Legendary Breeding just like
yours, which is, again, inheritable. In future jumps this makes people look upon you as a
member of the highest class of society, even if they can't particularly pin down why they think
that way. If taken with Naturally Getting Your Way Maneuver people will roll out the red carpet at
the merest hint of your presence, or the equivalent anyway, even if they wouldn’t normally give
that kind of service to anyone outside of a very specific and select group of individuals."
26,300,Hanma,Baki The Grappler,Bloodline,"A lineage genetically predisposed to excel in all matters of violence, growing stronger with each battle. The quintessential Hanma bears the title of “World’s Strongest Lifeform”. Monstrous beasts, modern armies, and even natural disasters kneel before his physical might.

Those of the Hanma blood tend to develop demonic imagery throughout their body, such as the skull, back muscles, and even the brain.

For 150cp, the genes took to you quite poorly, so you won’t see any immediate benefits, but you’ll still have a much greater upper potential and spirit than most. Whether you can catch up depends on how much you’re willing to sacrifice for power.

For 300cp, you are a true heir to the Hanma name. So long as you continue to challenge yourself, you may catch up to masters with decades of experience in a few years, and the Ogre’s power may very well be within reach."
27,300,Jamirian Ascendancy,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Bloodline,"Once a pseudo-human race on the lost continent of Mu, Jamirian alchemists were allies to Athena and the creators of the 88 Cloths. In the Age of Myth however they nearly went extinct, and the survivors relocated to Jamir, a remote place near Tibet. With time and cross-breeding with humans, they now are only recognizable for the two red dots on their forehead. You are one of such people, gifted with an affinity with ""Psychokinesis"" (a general term for more esoteric uses of cosmo like telekinesis, teleportation, telepathy, sekishiki, and so on…), as well as taught the art of repairing Cloths. With training and experiment however, you may one day restore this later tradition to its former glory, able to forge entirely new Cloths of your own."
28,300,Ancient Gods,Feng Shen Ji,Bloodline,"Ancestors of the current gods, during primordial times. These beings stand about 
2-3 meters tall, all sporting a set of feathered-wings and horns, some with 
multiple eyes, and others having more bestial traits with fangs, claws, beaks or 
prehensile tails (your choice on how you appear). They also seem to have 
powers beyond the 8 known Divine Powers, able to shape energy constructs for 
simple armaments or to be shot at their enemies (think very low tier energy 
manipulation) with physical abilities allowing them to exert and withstand 5 tons 
of force, and a fly speed matching a large bird of prey.
"
29,300,Bloodline Integration,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Bloodline,"People of old used to merge
with the blood of demon beasts, granting them more power than
normal cultivators. You have learned their strange craft, learning
to merge with the bloodlines of various different creatures,
gaining their strengths and, selectively, their genotypical and
phenotypical traits. The only material you need is a bit of blood
from a creature.
You can only merge with one bloodline at a time, and can
choose to delete your bloodline obtained through this method at
any time you wish. Any dangers and weaknesses from the
original process are nullified completely, for example, you will
never suffer the bloodline rejection the Silver Winged Family
suffered from.
These traits pass genetically to your offspring, if you want. You
can use this method on other people too"
30,400,Revenant,UQ Holder,Bloodline,"With the right magic, the dead can rise and walk among the living once more. You are a particularly well-crafted spirit known as a Revenant, a ghost that can take physical form and possesses many poltergeist-like powers. You can freely shift between tangible and intangible states, where only magic and anti-ghost effects can touch you. You have incredible telekinetic powers, allowing you to fly or destroy entire buildings with just a thought. You can possess people, making them do what you want while experiencing everything their bodies feel, or you can do the same with technology, controlling it and bending it to your will. Over time and with practice, you can enhance your ghostly powers and even unlock new ghostly abilities. However, you are vulnerable to effects that are strong against ghosts and spirits, and you can be exorcised, forcing you to pass on. With enough power, you can resist this and even learn to bring yourself back from the brink of exorcism through sheer willpower. As an undead spirit, you do not age."
31,400,Body of the Reaction God,"A Cultivator's Beginning",Bloodline,"A very important way used to improve one’s strength and abilities in this world is the use of herbs and medicines, and certain other substances such as crystals and other supplements.

You are especially fortunate in such things, possessing a body and soul that allows you to reap over three times the normal rewards from any such methods you use. Regardless of whether they affect your body, soul or meridians, the rewards are immense enough to leave even veteran experts mind boggled.

At the same time, the harmful effects of any resources that normally would need to be processed to be consumed safely are entirely removed."
32,400,Jamirian Blood,Saint Seiya Episode G,Bloodline,"A special property flows through your veins, granting your blood the magical ability to repair mystical artefacts on its own. Just by letting out your blood to drip over the magical item in question, you can see it begin to mend itself. The more powerful the item, the more blood it will take you, but even something as great as one of the Gold Cloths would only take 2 pints of your own blood, easy to handle for a Saint. The process will take an entire night, though you can speed it up by offering even more of your own blood. If you also had specialized tools, you would be able to work at a far faster speed in repairing these items."
33,400,Dragon Tribe,Feng Shen Ji,Bloodline,"The ruling class of the Ancient Gods, this small clan within the Gods hierarchy is 
at the top of the food chain even in the present day. Standing around the same 
height as their brethren, some sport horns while all of their kind have sharp 
claws, and instead of wings on their backs they have 2 draconic heads growing 
from their backs about three meters in length. While these heads can act 
independent of your own actions, they still act as extensions of your own senses 
while being able to channel any ability/perk you have access too. Physically 
these individuals can match a “Ancient Dark One” in strength alone (being able to 
lift and strike with 10 tons of force), and much being faster than the human eye 
can track if they really put some effort into moving about.
"
34,400,The End of A Thousand Years ,Tsukihime,Bloodline,"All True Ancestors suffer from an instinctive but purely psychological bloodlust that they must suppress using their own powers in order to act rationally and control themselves. Your unusual condition doesn’t make this much of a problem as a True Ancestor yourself...but you’ve either found a way to safely tapinto it or just have anger issues powerful enough to make you into a rampaging monster. You may choose to tap into this bloodlust and stop holding yourself back, complete with glowing yellow pupils and red irises, which greatly enhances your phys .
"
35,400,Fujo Blood ,Kara no Kyokai,Bloodline,"The arts passed down through the Fujo clan of Demon Hunters, a rare and mostly faded family, have awakened within you. Likely the result of a distant ancestor if you’re not a clan member, it has several effects on your body and spirit. The first is an enhanced life-force, making it possible for you to survive wounds and illnesses that would kill normal humans quite quickly. Despite taking the same wounds, your body is unnaturally enduring. The second is an enormous natural talent for magecraft relating to the channeling and controlling of spirits, not enough to match a Risen Legend but enough to become quite well known should you be trained. More importantly, that talent is the basis of the core power of the Fujo. ESP, or the projection of their spirit from their bodies. Leaving your physical form resting behind you, you can move as a spirit in the world, your power dictated by your magical energy. Possessing and controlling humans directly becomes far easier and you already know how to bind the spirits of the recently dead to your service while in this form. More spiritual powers may appear with practice and power, though even now you’re able to rapidly cross all of the city while flying along as a ghost.


"
36,400,Shapeshifting,The God of High School Jump,Bloodline,"Your physical form is far less set in place then your divine brethren. Rather than emitting your divine power to enact effects on the outside world or concentrating it within your body to enhance yourself, you can use your life energy to change the shape and attributes of your own body. At first, you’ll mostly be limited to changing between anything humanly possible along with taking on the features of animals such as claws, spines or wings. As your power and skill grows, you will be able to greatly increase your physical abilities, grow immensely in size, turn yourself wholly into animals, mundane or fantastic, or even shift yourself into forms that exist nowhere but in your own imagination."
37,400,Seija,Ragna Crimson,Bloodline,"Contrary to popular belief, the high-tier dragons, known as the Seija, aren’t actually evolved dragons. Quite the opposite, the low and mid-tier dragons are born from the blood of the Seija. Now you are one of these beings, ranked around the 10ths in your bloodline, at least without any other perks or powers.

Powerful beyond human belief, the Seija are former humans who were turned into dragons by one of the six Kings of the brethren families, gaining through them the blood of ‘god’. Capable of a regeneration that will let them survive even if only a part of their head remains and allowing them to walk during the sunlight without any problem, resistant to all but the most powerful silver auras, these beings are the peak of power in this world. They can kill even the strongest humans with their bare hands without too much effort, at least without accounting for other special powers and magics, and their blood is so rich in mana that they can cast their magics just by imagining the effects without the use of any incantations or hand-gestures. A single Seija would be capable of destroying an entire city on their own and take on hordes of dragon hunters without a problem. And that’s only while they are in their ‘humanoid’ form, as they can transform into large dragons at will just as well, gaining at least a five times increase from their previous humanoid physical and magical power.

Be warned that silver disrupts the magical power that flows through the Seijas’s blood. Should some silver weaponry disrupt the blood flow, such as managing to penetrate your impossibly hard skin through enough force or quality of the weapon and destroying your heart with the same weapon, it would cut your regeneration factor and prevent you from casting magic unless you manage to remove it and the frozen parts.

The transformation from human to Seija also adds a curious side-effect: all previous hatred towards dragons is eliminated, and at least a small amount of loyalty towards their King is gained. It is possible to regain or gain a new hatred for dragons, however, and you may even defect your king if you are displeased with their way of acting."
38,400,Riastrad,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Bloodline,"A legendary fury that only the greatest and most naturally inclined warriors can enter. The Riastrad, known as the Warp Spasm, is a transformative state that you have now discovered the ability to
trigger within yourself. Trigger it and your body will begin to change. Your muscles will bulge and
your stature grow far beyond any mans. Your bones will twist and warp, yet not hinder you at all. Even your hair will become a deadly weapon, turned into sharp spikes that stand on end. In every
way, you will become an ungodly beast. Yet this hideous form comes with immense power, greatly
magnifying your physical abilities. Few warriors could resist your blows in this form or keep up with
the speed of your mad charges, even should you be a mediocre warrior in your own right. The
transformation may grant you tens as times as much power as before but it drives you into a near
mindless frenzy, robbing you of the use of much of your skill in combat and other intelligence, though you can still distinguish friend from foe in a vague sense. You are also able to reform from
this transformation at will."
39,400,Profound Handle,Against The Gods,Bloodline,"The Bloodline of the Yun Clan of the Illusionary Demon Continent, this is your very own Cyan Profound Handle. Maybe you’re descended from a bastard offshoot of the clan, maybe you’re a member, it matters little. 
What does matter is what you can do with this. You have at your disposal a formless stuff, comprised of a nebulous mix of your blood and soul. It has 60% of your cultivation, soul and mental strength, in addition to what you already have. 
The profound handle resides in your left hand, and can be released at any time you want. It can use any and all abilities you can that rely on the above attributes, though no other. It can take any shape of your choice, but the colour remains fixed. You can also use it as a decoy by generating your aura from it and suppressing it at your own body, if you want. 
In addition, the Profound Handle is capable of other things like directly interacting with souls, your or other people’s. You can manifest aspects of your soul through this handle, allowing it to operate semi-autonomously and support you while you focus your attention on other things. It can also interact with other’s souls, allowing you to do things like performing surgery on them, searching their memories, and potentially much more. 
In essence the soul is as clay, to be moulded by the Profound Handle as you will. Finally, while it’s almost impossible to manifest more than one handle below the Divine Realm, there is no telling just what all you could achieve with it later on. 
As mentioned above, the handle you get is Cyan in colour, the same as the greatest geniuses of the Yun Family. However, if you want you can pay an additional 300 CP and receive the Gold coloured handle instead, which has 100% of your power, in addition to all the other abilities being proportionately strengthened."
40,400,Supreme Attribute Beast Bloodline,Against The Gods,Bloodline,"You have the bloodline of one of the Supreme Beasts of either
Fire or Ice, which are the Vermillion Bird, the Phoenix, and the Golden Crow for Fire, and the Ice
Phoenix, the Celestial Qilin, and the Blue Dragon for Ice. You have received several drops of their
blood, granting you their bloodline so you count as having descended from them, along with the
power of their respective flames or ice.
In terms of sheer destruction, the Golden Crow’s Yang-rich flames are the most powerful in this
universe, while the Vermillion Bird’s power is the greatest when it comes to cleansing Devils and
assorted creatures. There is likely a similar hierarchy for the Ice Beasts, but the details are
unknown.
In the Item section, this gets you the respective Profound Art Jade Tablet for free."
41,400,Dragon God’s Bloodline,Against The Gods,Bloodline,"You have six drops of the Dragon God’s blood in your veins, and his
marrow which will produce more, at a glacial pace of like a drop every several years until you’re 10%
Dragon. This gives you extreme durability, to the extent that your bones are like tempered steel, and
you gain a potent regenerative effect, regaining both your strength, health and profound energy at a
rapid pace even in the middle of combat. It also makes you massively more resistant to poisons and
other harmful effects.
This perk makes it so that strictly speaking you don’t even need to cultivate now. Any powers you
possess will continue getting stronger as you grow older, with no upper limits except your lifespan,
which is extended to several hundred years.
Finally, once per jump including this jump you can produce a ‘Dragon Seed’, which you may impart
to someone else of your choice through sex. This heals them of any and all injuries or illnesses they
may have, and nearly doubles their powers and energies. With time, you can learn to impart it
without the sex too, but one person can only benefit from it once. This changes to once every ten
years after your chain ends."
42,400,Great Way of the Buddha,Against The Gods,Bloodline,"This is the Divine Profound Art of the Primordial Rage God, which
allows one to achieve wonders with the body. It has Twelve Stages, each more difficult to achieve
than the last.
This art does not depend in any way on one’s profound veins or profound strength, working instead
from your soul, and nature itself. Your progress on this path depends on your comprehension of it,
with each level unfolding as your comprehension improves.
This art provides you two things to begin with, those being increasing strength, and increased
healing ability. Both stem from the power of Heaven and Earth around you flowing into you through
the mysteries of this art, enhancing your body dramatically.

At the first level, this art passively gives you strength of almost two tons, and the ability to heal
from all wounds in a couple of days.
At the second level, this art gives you strength of four tons, and provides significant improvements
to your healing speed.
At the third level, this art gives you strength of ten tons, and increases your durability to the level of
pure steel. Your healing abilities enter the realm of active regeneration here, although it will still take
hours to deal with grievous injuries. The silver pagoda you manifested so far also turns into a faint
gold color.
At the fourth level, this art gives you a strength of fifty tons and you enter the intermediate level of
the art. The pagoda becomes a dull gold in color and your blood is slightly tinted gold. Your body
now cultivates at all times, providing a slow but steady benefit to you continuously, but fast enough
that you could gain a level of Emperor rank in a couple of months even if you do nothing else.
At the seventh level, this art gives you the ability to restore important bodily necessities such as
vision but it is impossible to reach this level even at the Sovereign realm while remaining in the
Mortal World. Trying will cause your body to explode.
Benefits provided by further levels are unspecified, except that the twelfth level is the peak, and it
grants you the original physique of the Rage God."
43,400,Evil God’s Profound Veins,Against The Gods,Bloodline,"You have the Profound Veins of the Evil God himself, one of the True
Primordial Gods of a Bygone age.
These veins do not provide you any qualitative advantage, in that they are not really much better
than human veins when it comes to channeling Profound Power. But in your veins, there exist seven
Gates. Each gate may be safely opened at a certain level of Profound Power, so that your body can
survive the process.
The first gate multiplies your powers by three fold, the second gate four-fold, and so on. In addition,
you also gain mastery of certain Profound Arts as long as the gates are open, one with each gate.
These veins also let you absorb the Evil God’s Seeds for various elements as you find them. In the
item section, you get these at a discount."
44,400,Sovereign Arm,A Will Eternal,Bloodline,"You have fused one of your limbs with the intact remains of a mysterious powerful cultivator.
Not much was left, but what was there has imbued your body with a sliver of their power.
One of your limbs is one cultivation level higher than your current level, and will remain so as
you progress. Its fleshy body power can be used as if you were at that level, and will be able
to channel what spiritual energy you have more easily, and in greater quantities. This will not
affect your general cultivation level."
45,400,Celestial,Generic Exalted,Bloodline,"Movers and shakers, at this level you are a force to be reckoned with. You may
choose to be a Lunar, masters of shape-shifting and surviving things they really shouldn't, or
Sidereals who can bend and twist the weave of Fate to invoke all sorts of esoteric things.
Lunars are aspected towards the Moon, appropriately, and may freely transform themselves into
any animal or creature that they have tasted the 'heartsblood' of (literally). Sidereals however
are basically Fate Ninjas and aspected towards the Stars, able to divine future events, force
destinies on people (usually without them knowing), and twist the world in all sorts of subtle
ways.
Of the two Lunars are by far the more direct, and significantly more capable in direct matters
(especially of violence), they're also insanely difficult to actually pin down and kill, surviving
situations where virtually anyone else would die. Sidereals however are much more subtle by
design. Sidereals powers often require either significant preparation or specific, and sometimes
difficult to arrange, triggers in order to work. Additionally they are cursed by Arcane Fate,
meaning that they will fade supernaturally quickly from the memories of anyone they do not take
excessive effort to maintain close ties with, including their friends, family, and loved ones.
Companions are not exempt from Arcane Fate, though it will be togglable post-Jump"
46,400,Solar Exaltation,Solars Exalted,Bloodline,"Years prior, the Jade Prison holding the power of the Solar Exaltation was broken. Now, exactly
one-hundred and fifty are free and creating a new generation of the Chosen of the Sun.
Whether it is met with rejoicing or fear, the world is shaken by the return of its ancient masters.
Will this new generation learn from the mistakes of the First Age and save this ill-fated world? Or
will it just be an old tale told again through the eyes of the new? Whatever the end result will be,
I cannot say.
But now, you count yourself among their number, Jumper. You hold the greatest and most
terrible power this world has to offer, short of the distant glories the Yozi and Neverborn, once
the Primordials, had in that time before time. Though you start from the ground up, you may one

day reach and perhaps even surpass the glories of the First Age at their peak, and perhaps
bring peace back to this frayed world. Or perhaps you’ll simply adventure, or follow your own
ambitions. One thing is certain: Your destiny is your own."
47,400,Infernal Exaltation,Infernals Exalted,Bloodline,"You suffered a brutal setback, feeling like the world kicked you when you were already down. In your despair, a twisted being emerged, claiming to be a wronged cosmic architect. It speaks of an unjust imprisonment by cruel gods and offers you power beyond mortal reach to tear down a corrupt world. They promise strength to overthrow the gods who ruin your life, the power to save those you love, and a chance to be Exalted above all others. You accept, knowing they're lying but unable to resist.

Five days later, you emerge transformed, glowing with emerald light as one of the Infernal Exalted. You are stronger, resistant to sickness, and possess a lifespan that defies mortal limits. Most importantly, you wield Essence—Creation's primal energy—allowing you to fuel Charms, powers beyond human capabilities. Your soul shines with the light of Hell, marking your allegiance to dark forces. With the Infernal Charms of the Yozi, you can wield their power, creating new abilities, mastering sorcery, and bending supernatural martial arts to your will, though not without risk or drawback.

Finally, you are bound by an Urge—a mission central to the Reclamation's plan. Defying it will bring the Torment of your patron Yozi, with punishments as severe as flensing winds or a cursed silence."
48,400,Black Exaltation,Abyssals Exalted,Bloodline,"As one of the Abyssal Exalted, you will naturally be hardier than any mortal man. Healing in
days what mortals would in weeks, able to staunch bleeding wounds with mere will, able to
resist sanity-rending mental attacks, utterly immune to the negative effects of non-magical
diseases or infections (although they can become carriers), and while other Exalted may
have their lives extended to a greater or lesser degree, the Chosen of the Neverborn can live
forever, if they are not slain. The cold stasis of death forever traps their bodies at the age of
Exaltation, making deathknights the only ""immortal"" type of Exalted.
But that is not what truly separates you from mere Mortals. The Exaltation bonded to your
soul allows you to wield essence. As an energy, Essence is life, breath, power, the essential,
all-pervading animating energy of Creation. Though as an Abyssal, you shall instead draw
upon the cold and sterile Essence of the Underworld, necrotic instead of living.
Still, for you it is the size of your spirit and the magical power of your soul. Should you draw
upon too much of it, you will first manifest the bleeding mark of your Caste upon your brow
and then your aura shall bloom into a terrible, dark majesty. When an Abyssal’s aura turns
fully totemic, any mortal who sees it feels both the terror and the lure of the Void. Merely
mortal minds can break when subjected to such horror.
With essence, you fuel your Charms. Each is a technique for channeling Essence through
the body or mind to enhance yourself to superhuman levels. As one of the Abyssal Exalted,
you wield dark mirrors of Solar might and charms to invoke oblivion and the Deathlords, with
which you elevate your skills to new and terrifying heights. You may wield these dread
powers, create new ones within the capabilities of Abyssal charms, even learn supernatural
martial arts or mighty necromancy."
49,500,Artificial Vampire,UQ Holder,Bloodline,"You’re a lord or lady of the night now. You’ve been turned into a Vampire, an exceptionally powerful one but ultimately not a true Noble of the race. Instead, you are a similar being to Evangeline AK McDowell or the young Touta Konoe, a line of artificial vampires first created by the Lifemaker. If you wish, you may be a vampire sired by Evangeline herself. You cease to age and retain eternal youth as a vampire and possess an incredible healing factor. You can survive even having your head
or heart destroy and accomplish feats such as regenerating your entire upper half of your body after it is obliterated in just a few minutes. However, your regeneration has a flaw. It can only regenerate parts of your body that have been destroyed. If your head was reduced to bloody mist or your arms were burnt to cinders, they would regenerate. But if an arm was cut off and taken away from you, your lost arm would not heal from your body until that severed and taken arm is destroyed. You possess none of the normal vampire weaknesses as an Artificial Vampire and have superhuman physical abilities, letting you outmatch any normal human ten times over. You can fly at your normal ground speed and turn into a swarm of bats at will. You’re even able to drain magic from other people by biting into them and sucking out their blood."
50,500,Stock,UQ Holder,Bloodline,"Life’s one big game, at least the way you see it. Quite literally, given the nature of your immortality. You possess a stock of extra lives, allowing you to respawn next to your own corpse after dying and granting you 3 seconds of invincibility upon respawn. You start with three lives, but you can replenish them by killing monsters and enemies. It takes a few hundred average monsters or a few strong demons to regain a life, which shouldn’t be too difficult for a well-trained warrior. As a side effect of your immortality, you also have a visual HUD effect that you can activate, giving you an instant, complete readout on who someone is and all their skills and powers, as if you were viewing a fully revealed stat sheet."
51,500,Gourmet Cell Mutation,Toriko,Bloodline,"Gourmet Cells in your body have mutated into something new and different. You gain a beneficial mutation to help you that comes in two flavors:

Physical Mutation: Extra Arms, Prehensile Hair, Wings, Extra Eyes and other strange physiological mutations become apparent on your body. More likely than not it will be an external mutation but it's also possible to be something internal such as your skeletal structure changing to a fluid or possibly growing redundant organs such as a second heart and two more stomachs. Best examples are Sunny and Grinpatch. You can take up to Three Physical Mutations for free. Can add more after paying 50 CP for each new one. In case of powerful mutations like Midora's Mirror Neurons could be taken once, with the ability to take only one more mutation. If not obvious, you can purchase the enhanced senses of the Four Heavenly Kings.
Elemental Mutation: Your Gourmet Cells have given you the capacity to manipulate and/or control some form of energy or substance. You might have grown the capacity to generate electricity, the ability to emit super sonic sounds, or even the ability to produce poisons. This doesn't give you the ability to manipulate gravity, time or things like Dark Matter. Its strictly biological energies that a living organism could potentially produce such as heat, light, sound, and so forth. Best examples are Zebra and Tengu Brunch. Elemental Mutation may only be taken Once."
52,500,Inheritor of Ancients,Against The Gods,Bloodline,"You have had some fortunate encounters, Jumper! As suited for a
Smooth guy like you, of course, You have received a True God’s bloodline directly from the source,
with no dilution and a degree of purity and strength very nearly unmatched in this world.
This is a gift beyond peer, Jumper, treat it well. You may pick one Inheritance from the following list
per purchase : Profound Handle, Supreme Attribute Beast Bloodline, Dragon God’s Bloodline, Great Way of the Buddha and Evil God’s Profound Veins"
53,500,Allheaven Bloodline,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Bloodline,"You are the inheritor of the most exalted bloodline in this universe, which originates from the
supreme being of the Vast Expanse. And this bloodline represents a gateway to great powers
that can shake the world and overturn the heavens and the earth.
The first of these powers lies in the Nirvana Brand, a heaven defying innate magic that is
symbolized by a green mark on the hand of its bearer. The Nirvana Brand allows one to
undergo Nirvanic Rebirth up to four times, which allows them to immediately reincarnate with
their identity intact without needing to go through the cycle of reincarnation and birth in
between.
Each time a bearer of the Nirvana Brand goes through a Nirvanic Rebirth they produce a
Nirvana Fruit, up to a total of four. Nirvana Fruits are a great source of power, valuable even to
Transcendent cultivators, but their true worth can only be displayed by their owner.
While it still counts as a form of reincarnation, undergoing Nirvanic Rebirth through your
Nirvana Brand will not end your chain.
The second power granted by the Allheaven Bloodline is that it makes it possible to achieve the
three special stages of True Immortality; the Immortal Emperor, Allheaven Emperor Immortal
and Allheaven Dao Immortal realms. These stages are possessed of such power that they could
allow one to overthrow cultivators entire cultivation realms above them with brute force, and
completing all three would establish a near unprecedentedly powerful and stable foundation
for future progress. Because of this perk you will only require a fraction of the effort and
resources that it would normally take to reach these realms, which could have been ruinous
otherwise.
Finally, this perk grants the power to awaken the potential to achieve the three special stages of
True Immortality in anyone connected to you by blood by creating an Allheaven Dao seed
within them. This can be done individually, in groups, or to everyone linked to you through
blood all at once. You can remove the Dao seed from anyone you have granted it to and, once
you step into the Allheaven Dao Immortal realm, control the life and death of anyone with an
Allheaven Bloodline awakened by you with a thought.
As a precaution, your bloodline connection to Allheaven cannot be used against you in any
way.

After this jump your Nirvana Brand will renew its ability to perform four Nirvanic Rebirths at
the beginning of each new jump or every ten years, whichever comes sooner."
54,600,"Form, Change Up",UQ Holder,Bloodline,"The form you are in now is just the first of many for you, as you possess several additional transformation states that allow you to access much greater power at the cost of your mental state. You can enter any of your four transformation levels at will, the first form being several times as powerful as your base form and each further transformation being significantly stronger than the one before it. Each form will look progressively more monstrous, as well as seriously strain your stability and calmness. Even the first form will make it very hard to not go into a berserker rage, and the fourth form would require a miracle of some sort to prevent you from descending into a mindless fury. The forms are tiring to maintain and will eventually deactivate, even if you are lost in a rage."
55,600,Demiurge,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Bloodline,"There are currently 8 Demiurges in the entire multiverse: Allison, and the Seven. Well, it looks like there are now 9, with you getting in. This power manifests as a glowing white dot on your forehead. While it can be covered, it otherwise can’t be hidden or gotten rid of. At will, you may also manifest a halo above your head, and beyond having to look kinda like a halo, you get to choose how it looks. This power, access to the Key of Kings, grants you many abilities. First, you are able to do stuff like summon phantasms of gods to fight for you, have clones made up of white energy split from your body and attack your enemies, teleport, and more. Additionally, you know one of the words of the Seven Part Name, YISUN’s true name. By saying this word, you damage reality itself, and even kill those of weak will. Finally, you can also loan some of your power to your followers. How strong these powers you give them depends on how much power of your own you sacrifice, but these blessings can be pulled back to you at no cost, and making your power whole again. You can also make your Emissaries, the people who have been granted power by you, have their mind twisted to your goals, though those with strong will can fight against this, even defeat your corruption. The Key you get is equal to Allison’s/Zoss’s, though you have to learn how to use it. The downside to this power is that anyone that sees your Key and knows what it is, they probably want to steal it for themselves. And if it is taken out of your head, you fall unconscious and take a ton of damage and pain, regardless of any power you have. Post-jump, you may choose to hide the Key, revealing no outward signs of it. This perk is also a capstone booster, look in the Notes section to see how it affects the capstones."
56,600,The Devil Gene,Tekken,Bloodline,"You possess the Powers of the
Devil Gene. This power allows you to take on the form of a Devil, becoming a destructive force of
nature. In this state you will be an absolutely merciless weapon of Mass destruction, easily one of the
strongest beings in the World of Tekken. An orbital laser fired on you would only be good to piss you
of and may God have mercy on whoever invoked your Wrath. Devil Forms can be very different from one another but common factors are Wings and some change
in the pigments of your skin, as well as a third eye of sorts, alongside gleaming eyes. Otherwise you
may feel free to design it from Feathery wings to leathery or even fiery ones.
On top of boosting your physical capabilities you gain numerous other abilities such as Flight thanks
to your wings, the ability to fire Lasers from your Third eye and telekinesis so you may choke out the
poor fool that challenged you (or blow up their motorcycle). Additionally, in this form you become a
master of Mishima style Karate. Dark powers can be absorbed by you as well.
Usually, without extensive training and self-control, you would find yourself corrupted by this Power
and run the risk of being overwhelmed and overtaken by it. However, thanks to you paying with CP
you will be in full control and without risk of being overtaken by the Devil inside you. You could still
find yourself a lot easier to anger however and find sadistic glee in beating down whoever opposes
you."
57,600,The Angel Gene,Tekken,Bloodline,"Oh… this is interesting. Instead of the Devil gene a…
different power slumbers within you. Angel was a unique creature, doing Battle between Kazuyas
Devil over the young Mishimas soul at the time of Tekken 2. It is rumoured to be the good left in
Kazuya but has been disproved to be connected to his Soul in any way.
Now you are in possession of her powers. On top of all you would gain with the Devil Gene the Angel
is a pure source of good. Your mind is completely your own, not even an increase in anger will follow.
You also gain all perks gained by both purchases of the perk ‘Cleansing Bloodline’ for free, allowing
you to cleanse corrupted beings and seal away evil. Let the Light inside you clash with the Devils
and… well it would be a fight for the ages."
58,600,Gourmet Cell Spectrum,Toriko,Bloodline,"Most of those who host Gourmet Cells have them in one “color”. That means, the user would host only one Appetite Demon. Like Toriko himself, you too have Gourmet Cells in different “colors”. With this perk, you will be able to choose additional “basic” cells that you do not have, on top of those granted by Gourmet Cells from this selection: “Red” Gourmet Cells, “Blue” Gourmet Cells and “Green” Gourmet Cells. “Black”, “White” and unchosen types must be acquired in Jump. When successfully implanted in Jumper, they are covered in fiat granted by Jumpchain."
59,600,Born of the Sea,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Bloodline,"Whether you are a creature of the seas given
human form or blessed by the Sea God himself, your physical form is not limited to that of the
land-based apes that inhabit this Earth. You may freely change your physical form to any sort of
sea creature that currently exists in the world, anything between the size of a shrimp or the bulk
of a full-sized Kraken. The only restriction is that said creature must already be aquatic before
transforming into one of them. Roar, mighty Leviathan."
60,600,Sage’s Heritage,Reincarnator,Bloodline,"The Sages grow at an extreme rate. They are able to
learn very quickly with tremendously high intelligence, invent marvelous technology

and improve them. Their cells get reinforced by the mana as time goes on which in
turn enhances their body, all this because they are born with a unique organ within
themselves that convert their ingested nutrients into mana. Their control of mana
increases and their wisdom as they age. Their nickname in the past had been the
Race of the Dragons because they were like Dragons who got stronger as they got
older, and you are somewhat different, even though you might appear like a human,
your true heritage is that of a Sage, giving you all their innate skills, but because you
never inhabited a world that had mana, this power has been dormant, and now more
than active, you will feel this slow transformation as your body gradually becomes
one of a true Sage."
61,600,Arch-Demon: King of Evil,Avesta of Black and White,Bloodline,"You have been chosen by the Truth to play one of the most important roles in this universe: to be one of the heads of the side of evil. That is, you have become part of the weird, violent and dysfunctional family that are the seven Arch-Demons! It seems that you have taken the place of the mysterious Aka Manah, as probably very few would notice the difference in such a case.

The Arch-Demons are the mightiest of the Daeva, beings to whom destroying planets is expected, and you now have that same kind of strength. Not only that, but being the summit of the individualist Daeva, any powers derived from your own will or that enhance yourself are multiplied in potency, such as the Power of Ego or most Commandments.

In this world, Dagravant of similar tendencies to yourself will flock to you, or even new ones will appear molded after your own themes to become your servants. While these aren’t close to a true Household, it wouldn’t do for a true King of Evil to go without minions.

Lastly, as one of the pillars of the Evil faction, whenever you destroy a large portion of the forces of Good, you will feel as if your own momentum in the universal war is increased, making your enemies have a harder time to reorganize and the forces of Evil prosper faster. However, as the Arch-Demons are singular existences compared to the collective mighty of the Wahman Yast, your effects are far less pronounced, needing a much larger kill count for a similar effect. 

In future worlds, you will keep the same effects of the rank of Arch-Demon, and will be invited to join a similar group if it exists."
62,600,Pandora’s Child,Campione,Bloodline,"Ah, the Campione, the unrivaled humans that managed the impossible: to slay a deity by themselves. They are Pandora’s adopted children and the owners of a few advantages. Now, you’re one of them too. As a Campione, you gain an all-around stronger body, grant you a natural talent to understand any language, an increase in mana that would make even the most untalented into a rival for a Paladin and a natural Magic Resistance that rivals the Gods themselves, making all mortal magic basically useless against you and greatly diminishing the magical attacks from Gods or other Campione. Also, your body will become near ageless, also having an accelerated healing and gaining magic senses if you didn’t have them before. All in all, you could say that it improves everything about your body, not to mention that you also gain [Authorities] from any God you slay. Don’t get too lazy because of this, I must warn you, many Campiones have fell after relying too much on their natural advantages, since there are ways to go around them.

Gain up to 3 Authorities."
63,600,Dragon Soul ,Trinity Wonder,Bloodline,"Those with the Dragon Soul are able to gather vast amounts of mana to use for casting spells, as dragons are the origin of magic. As you progress in magic, so too shall you steadily attract more mana to yourself. People with dragon souls make powerful mages. However, the name Dragon Soul is not just for show. A special transformation can be triggered any time your life's in immediate danger, turning you into a powerful, regenerative, dragon. But this is not entirely without drawbacks. There is a downside to having this power; if you ever take in more mana than your body can handle, you will turn into a wild dragon until the excess is burnt off. Luckily for you, unlike the norm you will retain enough of your sanity to avoid hurting those close to you when you transform in such situations, unless provoked."
64,600,Beautiful Blood,Tsukihime,Bloodline,"You’re not a Dead Apostle, but that doesn’t seem to matter anymore, does it? The World itself cannot seem to process the idea of the Jumper dying...and is quick to correct that error. Through an act of paradox or supreme blasphemy, your body has achieved physical immortality that puts even vampires to shame. Your body will almost instantly heal from injuries - cuts disappears in seconds, missing limbs replaced in minutes. Even if you were reduced to a puddle of meat, you would still be good as new just a few minutes later...though you would be fully conscious throughout the pain and the regeneration. It isn’t so much that your cells are repairing themselves, but that your injuries are ‘rewound’ back to their original shape as though nothing happened. Though you can survive just about any sort of physical destruction this way, your mind and soul do not share this eternity, and can still be damaged by other means. It is also possible for someone to force the concept of ‘death’ onto your body, though the list of people capable of that here...well, it’s just one, really."
65,600,Holy Sacrament ,Tsukihime,Bloodline,"You do not simply wield holy weapons -you ARE a holy weapon. Whether as a side effect of a past curse or a quirk of your lineage, you are a bit beyond the average human being - your body alone qualifies as a holy weapon, able to strike spirits and monsters as though you were the living blade of a saint, greatly damaging the demonic and the malevolent by touch alone, should you so will it. You can sense the presence of supernatural monsters or great evil within a city block-sized area, and track them with all the skill of an expert hunter. Your physical abilities are likewise enhanced - your strength is enough to bend steel, your speed is enough to keep up with a car moving at full speed, and your durability allows you to survive bullets and piercing wounds with a fair amount of ease, though removal of limbs or vital organs still can’t be shrugged off with this alone. Finally, in your hands,any already-enchanted items or weapons designed as ‘holy’ are twice as effective, letting you tear through Dead Apostles with ‘common’ instruments like Black Keys and cutting a bloody swath through dozens of them with something like the Seventh Scripture. You are the one who hunts heretics and monsters in the night - and now, you embody that purpose.
"
66,600,Crimson Red Vermillion ,Tsukihime,Bloodline,"You are what your family and many others have struggled to achieve for generations - a perfectly realized demon within human flesh. And unlike others, you are not at risk of being victim to the Inversion Impulse or losing yourself completely - your human and demonic blood exist together in almost symbiotic harmony, though you may be a tiny bit more sadistic or vicious in this form. Your eyes change to an icy blue, your hair a fiery red, your body having become a living Mystery, giving you resistance to magecraft, magic, and other forms of supernatural influence or damage, as well as letting you damage or influence them in turn. All powers you wield that are blatantly supernatural in nature and originate from your body increase greatly in potency in this form, letting you become a terror and a reminder of why mankind knew to hide from the ferocious Oni. At first, this increase in power is by half-again of your full might...but with time and age, this may increase further.

Taking this in combination with The Beast lets you intermingle your physical strength andMystery seamlessly, increasing your already considerable might and letting you match even aHeroic Spirit blow-for-blow in hand to hand combat...and perhaps even emerge victorious. Thisform and its effects can be toggled on and off freely.

"
67,600,The Beast ,Tsukihime,Bloodline,"A monster. That’s what you are. Your strength alone is enough to put most human beings to shame - you can crush trees with your bare hand,remove a human head with a lazy swipe, and move faster than the human eye can follow. Your Endurance is similar, letting you withstand similar blows with ease, even surviving vicious attacks from a Dead Apostle or a skilled assassin that would normally tear a human being apart.In addition, your fighting style is both feral and graceful, letting you channel a monstrous berserker rage through yourself yet remain completely lucid no matter how overwhelming your bloodlust became, changing it into pure strength that adds to your already considerable might.Finally, you possess a muscled and athletic frame to match your newfound strength, which likely adds a considerable intimidation factor...or just a show that you’re not to be angered needlessly."
68,600,Phases of Divinity,The God of High School Jump,Bloodline,"All High Gods, the third highest rank of God and the one directly above you, possess additional forms that they may take on when they require more divine power. Whilst not yet a High God in rank, you have gained this innate ability and mastery over both of these new forms. You are able to take on the Second Phase and the Third Phase form. Each grants a progressively more massive boost to both your physical abilities as well as your life energy powers. The Second Phase grants you a more divine form, fitting to your own personal theme, whilst the Third Phase twists this into a monstrous visage, more akin to a wrathful God then an ordinary divinity. Whilst each of these forms drain your energy faster than normal, you excel at managing this cost and can stay in the Second Phase for hours at a time and the Third Phase for close to a single hour, much more than any of your elder brethren.

Boosted: A true god remains divine no matter his form. Once that spark was placed in your soul, it wouldn't leave no matter what you become or what you do. In fact, it's become rather useful that it won't leave you as your Phases aren't quite so limited. You're able to force these Phases to activate with other transformation effects, pushing them into a second and more divine form that possesses much greater power, though at the cost of great drain on your energy while active. You are even able to go to a Third Phase, as monstrous as normal and possessing even more power, though the drain is also increased.

69,600,True Form,The God of High School Jump,Bloodline,"The form you inhabit now is not quite your true form. Not anymore. Rather, think of the body you are in as a lesser, sealed version of your true magnificence. When it’s time to go all out, you can release the seal on your body and take your real form. Ten times as large as your normal body, this true form enhances your physical abilities and any powers that rely on your life energy immensely, enough to easily turn the tables when you’re being pushed to the brink of defeat by a foe much stronger then you are. However, the lengthy time you have spent without this true form renders it a tiresome thing to stay in and it will be a few years of practise before you can stay in it indefinitely.

Boosted: There's no need to ever fight alone again, not now that you have yourself with yourself. You are able to summon your True Form not as a transformation but as a separate being, a Charyeok connected to you that will aid you and fight alongside you. They're you in every way except them being ten times as big, rather more powerful in the physical and life energy departments and that they follow your lead without dissent. If hurt or destroyed, they'll take a week or so to slowly regenerate to full. They can be dismissed or summoned at will, like any Charyeok.

70,600,King,Ragna Crimson,Bloodline,"The Seija, the high tier dragons, do not come from the evolution of other dragons. No, they gain their monstrous powers and forms by receiving the blood of the Dragon God and undergoing a transformation. But the Dragon God isn’t the one in charge of this process. Instead, this task is delegated to the Dragon Kings who have been granted power by the Dragon God, one for each of the six Bloodlines: Wing, Scale, Claw, Breath, Eyes and Bone. You are now the king of one these bloodlines, even replacing the current Winged King if you wish so.

First, you have the power to bestow the ‘blood of god’ to others, initiating the transformation into Seija. This will turn even regular humans into the powerful dragons known as Seija, and each individual you turn into a Seija will gaining their own special powers and magical abilities. It’s not an ability that you can use often, perhaps you could do it a couple of times per year, and the maturation time to reach the maturity as a Seija varies from individual to individual as explained before, but a single Seija is more than enough to lay waste to armies of dragon hunters and bring ruin to cities.

Secondly, you have an increased potential when it comes to creating lesser dragons, being able to use your blood to spawn tens of thousands in a second in a giant tornado of fire and flesh. Lastly, it seems that the individuals that you remake as a King gain a strong affection towards you. It may be a deep crush, mad love or just a great amount of loyalty.

If you are not a Seija you may still turn others into members of your species and allow them to gain their own special magical powers, but you won’t become a king of the Brethren nor will you have the special ability to create more dragons."
71,600,Monster of Myths,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Bloodline,"Sirens, minotaurs, harpies, centaurs. They’re impressive magical creatures but they’re not usually
the sort of thing that a demigod would have stories told for triumphing over. That’s another breed
entirely. They need things like what you are now to fight for legends to be made. The hydra, the
nemean lion, the chimera. Dragons, demons, divine beasts of power such that they can challenge
lesser gods. You’re able to take the form of one of these legendary creatures, even one of your own
designs. With a physicality easily capable of killing most of the heroes of these lands and certainly
threatening figures such as Heracles or Achilles, your threat is only further heightened by your
immense magical power. Magic is so tightly entwined with your body that a few drops of your blood
could match the output of mana from a modern magus. Cities and mountains would disappear
before your wrath, should you have the means to make use of this energy.

It’s well you do, several in fact. The legendary creatures of Ancient Greece were not known for just
physical power. You can choose up to three magical abilities to have as innate parts of your form. The Hydra’s infamously toxic breath and multiplicative regeneration or the Nemean Lion’s immunity
to all works of man, even the mighty breath of a dragon and their unique reactor souls. The less
abilities you pick, the more powerful the magical ability but even three at once would each be things
to prize. Additionally, your current state is not the end of your advancement. Should you perform
monstrous acts while in this form, such as indiscriminate killing for pleasure, you’ll find that the form
will slowly grow in physical and magical power, potentially even in size as well, to scale with the
awfulness of your deeds. Your body coming to reflect the monstrosity of your soul, it appears. "
72,600,Vermillion Oni,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Bloodline,"Your Oni blood is awakened to the very limit of it’s potential, making you into a terrible creature the
equal of the rulers of the Oni Mountain. Rather than just making you a powerful Oni, this is in
actuality a trait that can apply to any species who you are part of, even in just sharing some of their
blood. You gain the potential to quickly awaken the legacy in your blood, gaining the powers of the
full race your line comes from and over time coming to represent the most powerful members of
that species. Additionally, your awakened blood grants you a significant advantage when you fight
against a member of your own species, drawing out a noticeable amount of extra strength from
within.

As an Oni, your powers are quite significant. Enough brute strength to crack open a mountain, cause
tremors across an island or turn a town into a series of craters. Incredible toughness, not just in
reducing the damage you take but surviving grisly wounds, able to live with a decapitated head or
crush chest without issue. Indeed, just cutting off your body parts won’t remove them from your
control, able to animate severed hands and legs as if you were still attached. Your magical power has
increased to match your strength in output and you are able to channel it into heat or fire, creating
and manipulating these elements at lethal levels of intensity. Despite the monstrous nature you
have, you’ll possess a charismatic presence that can even make those setting out to hunt you down
falter, in fear or wonder or even desire. Perhaps that presence also translates into a beautiful
countenance, if you haven’t decided to appear as a monstrous version of the Oni-kind?"
73,600,Stoker’s Demon,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Bloodline,"A legend that won’t ever give up it’s terrible hold on life. Bram Stoker wrote but a mere story on an
ancient count who fed on the blood of living beings but it grew so far beyond that, bringing fame to
the legend of the vampire and defiling the legacy of one Vlad Tepes. Despite the true form of
vampires being that of Dead Apostles and not this fictional breed, you still find yourself waking this
evening with the powers of that dread count.

The many traits of this classic fiction are present in you now. Unaging immortality and pale beauty
when not enraged enough to use your bestial abilities. Your body takes on a composition less of
flesh and blood, more shadows with mass, the change allowing you to survive even the most terrible
wounds with little penalty. A destroyed heart or damaged spirit core hardly slows you and your
potent regeneration can heal most wounds before the attack that caused them has even finished. This can be focused on certain areas to make it almost instantaneous but one should be aware that sustained levels of severe damage over time will cause your regeneration to slow and eventually
falter. Despite the fictitous nature compared to them, your regeneration abides by the same
mechanics of the Curse of Restoration that Dead Apostles have. It works via regressing time, rather
than simple healing, and grows stronger as the moon waxes.

The same shadowy powers that grant this healing also improve your power, giving you the strength
to effortlessly bat around powerful Heroic Spirits or cause the ground to tremble for miles. Your
speed matches this physical strength, bursts of movement that can cross miles in moments or let
you throw out attacks well beyond the speed of sound. All of the many incidental abilities shown by
Count Dracula are yours to possess as well. Control over the weather or shadows, hypnotism and
manipulating the memories of humans, crawling on walls or commanding the animals of the night
and more. Your shapeshifter abilities let you turn into such animals, as well as mist or a swarm of
bats, an instant transformation that can make melee combat against you near impossible.

As is natural for any vampire, you have the claws and fangs to suck blood from others. Not only does
this sate your own deep hunger for blood, it also turns those whose blood has been sucked into
undead slaves, barring great mental or magical resistance. Acting as ghouls loyal to you, you can
embrace and expand your undead army quite rapidly, and your bite has an unnatural ability to
bypass all defences against ‘attacks’. It is, after all, a show of affection to take them into your
undead family in such a way. But the legends of Dracula are not all positive and the presence of
sunlight will significantly weaken your powers, while holy powers can deal catastrophic damage to
you. A devoted priest of great power could very well kill you when a whole team of history’s great
heroes failed.

As your power comes from the legend of Dracula, it is possible that new or altered abilities will
reveal themselves in time. Sometimes temporarily, sometimes not, as the legend and story may alter
or have certain aspects become more popular in time. While the above abilities will always remain
with you, you may find that different worlds offer new variations to enjoy for a time."
74,600,Dragonheart,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Bloodline,"When you were but a babe, a mad wizard decided to test out a new spell on you. He infused your
body with the blood of a dragon, granting those same abilities in your frail human form. Or not so
frail anymore. Your core has become akin to that of a Dragon, immensely enhancing your magical
abilities. Your mana will grow immensely as you age, becoming close to equaling that of an adult
Dragon by the time you are an adult, and continuing to grow at a slower rate as long as you continue
to live. It will replenish at a terrifying rate, refilling from empty in but an hour of time as your inner
dragon generates nearly endless amounts within you. This draconic power also grants you a
extremely high level of resistance to magic, rendering you immune to spells save from the highest
class of magus, such as Merlin himself. However, it does also make you slightly more vulnerable to
attacks that have an advantage against dragons, due to your nature."
75,600,Mutant ,Chrome Shelled Regios,Bloodline,"Like Airen, Dixerio, & Nirphiria you have become an immortal Mutant who will continue to evolve as time goes on, but you have limited control over it. You regenerate as long as an atom of you remains and with no scarring afterwards. This regeneration affects your body, mind, and soul ensuring that any damage you take heals. This regeneration has a handy side effect of granting immunity to disease and poison. You have control over your regeneration; so if you want to permanently edit your genetics or stop something from regenerating you can. You stop aging once the prime of your life is reached, or revert back to your prime. Your appearance never deteriorates regardless of lack of exercise or food. Since you no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe for living anymore, but may still do so for enjoyment. Your hair and teeth will always be perfect no matter the situation you are in and regrow if lost. Your mind is equally made immortal granting you a perfect memory, with instant recall, unlimited storage, perfect indexing, perfect comprehension, and you can not lose your memories if your head is destroyed or time altered. Your immortality includes being immune to corruption, changing or copying your memories, mental attacks, hacking, mind control, brain damage, & possession. You may share this immortality with those you are married to and/or are soulmates of, but they may not do the same. "
76,600,The Legendary Jumper,Dragon Ball,Bloodline,"There are a few rare members within each species who possess immense battle power
and talents far surpassing their species standard. Some examples of this include Frieza,
Slug, and Broly. They represent the mutant variants of the Frost Demons, Namekians,
and Saiyans respectively. By taking this perk you may become a legendary mutant of
whatever species you belong to.
This will greatly amplify your power and likely give you your own unique abilities. For
example, Saiyans would gain access to the Legendary Super Saiyans forms, have their
power double every year like Broly, and a much stronger anger boost. Lastly, choosing
this option will remove any negative side effects of the form. Using Saiyans again, you
wouldn’t become a mindless berserker due to rage."
77,600,Eternal Son,A Will Eternal,Bloodline,"You are a being directly created by the Eternal Mother herself, in a moment of her rare
waking, to be another possible weapon to use against the Mortal Renegade. This has left
you with a single overwhelming attribute. This could be an unrivalled hardiness, near instant
regeneration, seemingly endless life-force, or something else. You may only have a
weakened version of this while still at the early stages of your cultivation, but as you
progress, so too shall this powerful ability grow with you naturally, even without your help."
78,600,Solaroid,Generic Exalted,Bloodline,"You have been Exalted above all others, even more so than the other types of
Exalted. You are a Solar or, perhaps, you gained one of the corrupted Solar exaltations that
changed you into an Infernal or an Abyssal. At this level you are at the very top of the Exalted
food-chain, able to go toe to toe with legends and perform feats of skill so incredible that they'll
be talking about them hundreds of years after the fact. Eventually, at least. You don't actually
start out that strong but you'll get there one day. Solars are aspected towards the Sun, Infernals
towards the Yozi (demons/Titans), and Abyssals towards the Neverborn (Titans that got killed
and then stuck between life and death). Solars embody perfection of self, becoming paragons of
whatever trades, crafts, skills, or magics they focus on. Infernals take on traits of their patron
Yozi, and Abyssals are aspected towards the essence of death (pretty much no matter what you
do as an Abyssal, someone is going to die because of it).
Regardless of which type you choose they're all on a relatively even playing field with each
other, largely because Infernals and Abyssals are corrupted Solar exaltations, and they can all
eventually reach dizzying heights, capable of routine feats of skill that mortal grand masters
could not imagine replicating with a lifetime of effort and eventually the ability to use conceptual
effects both for defense and offense."
79,600,Orphan Cub of the Devil-Tiger,Infernals Exalted,Bloodline,"As the Dragon Beyond The World was once both there and yet to be, so too was there was
a Devil-Tiger. With a Triumphant Howl they became Primordial, by Swallowing the Scorpion
they freed themselves from the Yozi's tethers, through a Tempest of Inward Focus they
redesigned their Caste, in the Flames of the Rising Phoenix they wrought new Charms for
their Primordial selves, and in front of the Face of the Titans they subsumed their Coadjutor
and refined their Urge to match their will.
And yet... no such being exist now, in flesh or in memory, but for an echo from Beyond. You
now carry this echo, your Exaltation matching that of this lost Tiger. Unlike all other Infernals,
you are free from the Yozi's influence and carry the potential to learn Charms based on the
themes of your forebear. Themes that seem up to your choice for now, though you will never
be able to change these when they have come into reality.
While your Caste has been irreversibly changed to another from this point on, you may still
use both the Caste and Favored Yozi you picked beforehand for the purposes of your
discounts on Yozi perks."
80,800,Soul Prince(ss),Bleach,Bloodline,"Ichigo Kurosaki is set to make quite the mark on the world. What he is and what it let him do won’t
go unnoticed by the powers that be, who may seek to make their own tools in his image. Someone
must have predicted this trend, given you already exist this early. However it came to be, you are an
entirely artificial attempt at creating a replacement for the Spirit King, going beyond even a natural
potential like Kurosaki to become something more. The basic part of this nature is that you are equally and innately part each of the Shinigami, Quincy, Hollow and Fullbringer races. This works via a free purchase of Hybridisation for each perk, set to
make you a otherwise normal member of each race rather than any other variation. This otherwise
works as normal for the Hybridisation perk in regards to discounts and such. More importantly are the countless tiny fragments you’ve been inserted with that originate from the
Soul King. The raw power of these parts have given a royal tinge to your Reiryoku, giving you
spiritual power equal to an experienced Shinigami Captain. Combined with meeting all requirements
for the throne, you’ll start to see much more valuable developments as you age. Unlike a mere
substitute for the King, you are a true successor, and will very slowly begin to develop the same
powers on your own. Though the process will take several millennia at least to come close to
finishing, you will slowly develop the same great and varied abilities as the King as your soul ages. Your spiritual power will naturally grow stronger from age, while new and incredible powers awaken
in your various body parts. Provided you continue to develop yourself and experience life, the road
to royalty will continue progressing regardless of how much you train in the combat arts."
81,1000,Divine Curse,UQ Holder,Bloodline,"The love of a god, or at least as that divine being perceived it. You’ve been blessed with a curse of absolute inviolability. Nothing can harm or kill you. A sword might cut through your body, but it would not harm or impair you in any way. For a moment, an enemy might believe they have crushed you or reduced you to a bloody mist, but they are instantly proven wrong, as your body was never harmed in the first place, despite what they thought they saw. Even the attacks of beings far more powerful than you simply fail to have any effect. Starvation, suffocation, aging, and even magic that seeks to transform you—nothing will be able to change you for the worse, even without active hostile intent behind it. However, there is no protection from someone throwing you into deep space or burying you in the core of the Earth, nor from the madness that could arise from the years of isolation and sensory deprivation that would follow. The sacred power within you has more uses than just protecting yourself. Even now, you’re aware of how to charge it into your body and attacks to give them potent holy attributes or cleanse your and others’ bodies of impurities with holy light. With time, much greater uses of these powers could be found. Great swords of pure light could rain down in their hundreds or vast wings of light summonedto stop meteors from crashing into the earth."
82,1000,Vampire Noble,UQ Holder,Bloodline,"A relic of an age twelve thousand years in the past, you are one of the few true Vampires of the world, created through the ancient arts of magic and technology from a lost civilization. As one of these Nobles, you possess all the abilities of an Artificial Vampire, but with enormously increased levels of power. The few weaknesses they have, such as limitations on their regeneration, do not affect you, and even immortal hunters find it difficult to hinder your immortality or regeneration. Additionally, you likely have a wide variety of vampiric abilities that normal Artificial Vampires cannot access. Your raw power alone is absurd. While not unbeatable—especially against coordinated teams—you are more than strong enough to match the magic or physical prowess of anyone, short of another Vampire Noble or legendary figures like Negi Springfield in his adulthood and Ialdabaoth. Even if you lack magical skill depending on later choices, your raw power is enough to destroy cities or mountains with minimal effort. Simple magic projectiles in your hands are better compared to nuclear weapons.

You are also a particular kind of Noble, similar to Baal. Your True Form is not the humanoid body you currently possess but rather an amalgamation of magical beasts and demons, a dimensional slaughterhouse filled with writhing black monsters that surge from your shadow at will. These shadow beasts are your true form, with thousands of creatures acting independently or under your control. They can separate to operate at a distance or attack in unison. The creatures range from weak enough for a novice wizard to kill to mighty monsters capable of threatening the best that the UQ Holder organization has to offer. They are all parts of your body, allowing you to cast magic through them and ensuring your survival as long as even one creature remains. You can even absorb any creature you slay into your shadow, incorporating it into your True Form.

As all Vampire Nobles hail from ancient times, this option also grants you the title of Elder Immortal. While it doesn’t cost anything to take, it depends on you purchasing additional options below to gain full benefits. You will have 12,000 years of experience like your peers, but only the specific benefits that come with Elder Immortal, and no greater ones. Even Vampire Nobles can be sealed away or lose track of time as the eons pass."
83,1000,Apoptosis: My Path to Hell,Avesta of Black and White,Bloodline,"An Apoptosis is the phenomena from which those with divinity produce a being that is both their antithesis and the one with the absolute potential to end them, born from the self-destructive desires that they held. For whatever reason, you too seem to have a similar origin to those existences, perhaps related to one of the divine beings of this era.

However, you seem to be a special case even among these exceptional beings. An impossible being born out of the contradictory World of Dualism. Instead of being a self-destructive factor that brings the end of just its parent entity, the target for your destruction is mutable. If an Apoptosis is basically a divine cancerous cell that corrupts and kills the host from the inside, you are closer to a metaphysical virus that expands until it has consumed everything. 

You have become a vortex of destruction. An engine fueled by killing intent, capable of growing in strength as long your violent impulses remain, as well as empowering yourself with any killing intent directed towards yourself.

By turning your weapon towards someone, you begin to understand them, regardless of how alien they are supposed to be. The more you fight with them, the more you begin to peer into their psyche and the more attuned you become with them, and thus, the deadlier your blows are to them and the less effective their attacks towards you. You develop a resistance to their powers as you keep relentlessly moving forward to their destruction, your weapon never even once leaving your hand, and thus becoming able to see gaps in their techniques and use them to evade even attacks that bend causality to hit you. And when it comes to offense, these gaps also seem to forcibly manifest as your understanding deepens, appearing on even supposedly perfect armors, and then allowing you to strike with surgical precision to utterly annihilate the enemy. Even if those gaps didn’t exist before, your sixth sense will forcibly create and notice them, allowing you to strike the line that brings death. It doesn’t even need to be physical offense, your understanding of your target makes it so you can even crack and destroy their egos with verbal abuse, by exposing their deepest cravings and fears before crushing them. 

And finally, once you have been fully ‘synchronized’ with your victim, you can bring down the full potential of an Apoptosis: the complete annihilation of the host by a power that equals and then eventually surpasses them. You may find that they may even welcome it, being poisoned by the impulse towards self-annihilation that you have attached to them.

But unlike a regular Apoptosis, your strange nature has made it that you don’t die with your host. You have long surpassed the destiny of a mere cancerous cell. You instead take a part of them with you after slaying them, adding it to your strength, and become able to target a new victim. The more you walk this path, the more efficient this process becomes. Those who stand before you become easier to dissect with each new victim, regardless of how alien their minds were or how unfathomable they are supposed to be. Difference is power matter less and less, as your sword cleaves through them quicker each time, moving from one target to another quicker and quicker. Should you not decide to stop at any point, you could go on until every life in the universe has perished under your sword, before turning it to God itself. Until the only thing that remains in this universe is the immutable fact that is your endless desire for blood."
84,1000,Reincarnation(High God),The God of High School Jump,Bloodline,"You used to be someone special. Someone very special. In a past life you were one of the High Gods of this world, a being of quite literally Earth shattering power. But for some reason you died or lost your powers and were reincarnated into the form of a child of whatever race you are now. It is only recently that you have become able to awaken your powers, as will be described below.

All the following powers, including any supernatural abilities of the items included, will be activated via a transformation into your Godly state. At first this transformation will be tiring but over time you will be able to maintain it for longer and longer until it becomes maintainable for good. 

Your reincarnation grants you a great deal of powers based on who you used to be. You should pick one God, Monster or other Mythological being from legend to be your original self. Your powers and items will be styled after that figure. The exact power of your Reincarnation will depend on whether you buy the 1000 High God option or the 2000 Supreme God option.

The first thing that you gain is the physical abilities and life force of a greater being. You have the strength to destroy entire worlds in a single blow or lift them above your head with both arms and some strain. You outpace the speed of light a hundred thousand times over at least and can take hits that crush planets like humans can take hits from each other. Your life energy is such that you could almost drown an entire world just by releasing your power and that your life energy based abilities will be just as world ending as your physical force. 

You will gain 2 unique Divine Powers when you transform, based on the legend of the being you chose as your original self. These may be taken from the Divine Power section, if they fit, or made originally so long as they do not exceed the power level of the 600CP Divine Power options or the 600CP Charyeok options at most. 

Lastly, you will gain 2 unique items based on your original self's legend. These will be on the same level as the tools of the Monkey King, such as Yeoui/Ryu Jingu Bang or Yongpyo. If there are no items to draw from, it is possible to instead turn powers or feats that they have done into original items, though this must still be based on their actual legend.

These powers do not come without attention however. Taking the 1000CP option will lock you into the plot of this setting in a sense. Whatever actions you choose, you will end up fighting against several opponents at the level of the High Gods. If this means you join Mo-Ri Jin in his battle against the Gods and take several on yourself or if it means you face down the humans and find several empowered warriors on the level of High Gods in your way, so be it. 

You may find yourself also remembering your original selves' memories from time to time. They will not harm you or influence you but you may learn something from them, about your powers or about who you used to be."

The Supreme God option blows these out of the water. They can destroy a High God in a single punch, move at millions of times the speed of light with ease and laugh off the blows of these same Gods. Their life energy is so great as to terrify even High Gods when fully released and potentially threaten the stars themselves.

You will gain 2 unique Divine Powers when you transform, based on the legend of the being you chose as your original self. These may be taken from the Divine Power section, if they fit, or made originally so long as they do not exceed the power level of the 600CP Divine Power options or the 600CP Charyeok options at most. Supreme Gods gain an extra 2 unique powers, which may include things up to the level of the 800CP options in the Charyeok section of the jump.

Lastly, you will gain 2 unique items based on your original self's legend. These will be on the same level as the tools of the Monkey King, such as Yeoui/Ryu Jingu Bang or Yongpyo. A Supreme God will gain an additional 2 items that are also on the level of these Divine Tools, both also drawn from their own legend. If there are no items to draw from, it is possible to instead turn powers or feats that they have done into original items, though this must still be based on their actual legend.

If this means you join Mo-Ri Jin in his battle against the Gods and take several on yourself or if it means you face down the humans and find several empowered warriors on the level of High Gods in your way, so be it. The 2000CP option will instead guarantee that you face at least two opponents on the same level that Satan and Mo-Ri Jin reached during their climactic battle, whether they be those two at their greatest power or other, original characters. These battles willb be serious, life threatening ones and cannot be avoided, no matter how you much try. Any allies you have will be drawn away in this time, leaving you to prove yourself worthy of your own power.

You may find yourself also remembering your original selves' memories from time to time. They will not harm you or influence you but you may learn something from them, about your powers or about who you used to be.

86,1200,True Ancestor,Tsukihime,Bloodline,"A long time ago, there was a race of vampiric creatures known as the True Ancestors. Born as part of a pact between Gaia and Crimson Moon Brunestud, this race would exist as an extension of nature and the will of the planet itself, designed to return the planet to its ‘default’ state before the growth and advancement of humanity began to fester on its surface like a malignant tumor, obliviously killing the spirit of the world they lived on. However, not only were they detached from their original mission, but as they were based upon Crimson Moon itself, they suffered from a vampiric desire for blood despite their lack of need for such a thing. They would eventually become feral beasts, little more than living disasters akin to a living force of extinction. It was this flaw that would result in the creation of the Dead Apostles and the strongest of the True Ancestors - a weapon by the name of Arcueid Brunestud, the ‘Princess’ of the True Ancestors. And she would be the one who would slay almost every single one of them, leaving her and a very small handful remaining.

And you.

Somehow, you are an anomaly - a True Ancestor who sealed themselves away before Arcueid’s purge of her own kind, or perhaps one brought to life in the modern era against all odds. You and her are some of the only ones of your race left on the entire planet, and likely the only ones there will ever be. As such, you are both one of the most dangerous and most interesting beings left in this world of dying Mysteries. I hope you don’t mind - The Dead Apostles are likely to either fear you, covet you, or outright try to slay you themselves. And that’s before factoring in the many humans interested in your existence...

You are a creature, or rather a flesh-given spirit, that exists above what others would call ‘Divine’. Being born of the will of the planet, you have a natural connection to both nature and the ‘rules’ set by Gaia. Your body possesses superhuman speed, endurance, and strength - even if you were absolutely exhausted, you could tear open a three-story building with a swipe of your hand, move far faster than the speed of sound, and withstand most mundane physical attacks like leaves gently brushing against you. You possess an incredible resistance to what this world calls Conceptual Weapons and modern magecraft, most being unable to even scratch you unless they were truly powerful or designed to be used against you specifically (or your regeneration, such as the Church’s Black Keys). Similar to a Dead Apostle but well beyond their norm, you are able to regenerate from even physical annihilation by your injuries ‘reversing’ back to your healthy state. 

In addition, you suffer no physical weakness from sunlight, nor do you require blood to sustain yourself - simply a few days of rest will suffice should you overextend your abilities. In the daytime, you are physically tough. In the dead of night, exposed to the light of the Moon that your progenitor dwelled within, your already-considerable might increases greatly, making you able to swat aside most Dead Apostles like flies. This further increases with the phases of the moon, waxing and waning as it does. The concept of death itself flees from your body at night, and only in a state of extreme physical weakness or if your connection to the Earth is somehow severed are you vulnerable. In addition, your connection to the world enables you to use a phenomena called the Marble Phantasm - tapping into the will of Gaia and re-shaping it according to your will, using your imagination to create changes in reality. An example of this is turning the atmosphere within a hallway into vacuums that would slice apart a target like a knife, but the hallway itself remaining untouched because your imagination didn’t factor it in. Empowered by Crimson Moon, Arcueid Brunestud could pull out a version of the moon itself from the distant future, though this is an extreme example and beyond what you begin with. It is also more difficult to

use this ability within areas affected by the progress of human development and civilization, though the difference is slight - and while you cannot directly affect humans or things made by humans, you can easily do so indirectly, such as with the aforementioned vacuum blades. What you create with the Marble Phantasm must be something possible under the rules of the world - it could not make a creature or item made of dreams or magic, but it could create mundane animals and other results that were possible within the world - such as fire, villages, natural disasters, or even elementals and spirits born of the planet itself. The Marble Phantasm allows you to create results that were possible according to the laws of the world, akin to reaching into a bag of marbles and pulling out a white one every time with only a 1% of drawing it normally in a bag of black marbles. So long as it is a naturally occuring phenomena, you can create it - so you could create unpurified ore from nothing, but not a car or an anvil. Finally, you do not age, untouched by the ravages of time.

All being said, you are not invincible. Your abilities are not tied to a pool of blood or magical energy like Dead Apostles or Magi, but instead directly to your personal stamina. The more you exert yourself, the weaker your abilities become - while you remain formidable, you become increasingly vulnerable if you recently had to do something like recreate your body from slabs of meat in the daytime, requiring you to rest for several days. While fighting Dead Apostles constantly or making uses of Marble Phantasm will not be enough to drain you, coming back from certain death or battling nonstop for hours at your full power will likely be a heavy toll. You are also not the same level as Arcueid Brunestud is at her full power - the strongest of your might is a third of her full power, and while this makes you equals in the modern era, should she ever succumb to her bloodlust or become the vessel for Crimson Moon, she would slay you as easily as she did the rest of your kin. Finally, while you have no need for blood, you do suffer from the vampiric impulses of your kin...though it is more of a peckish craving and an annoyance in your current state, indulging in it will turn you into one of the ‘Demon Lords’, a rampaging beast that is a threat to humans and vampires alike - and likely target number one for the Princess herself.

However, whether from your youth or the unusual circumstances of your condition, you will find that your vampiric impulses can be suppressed by an act of will alone, needing none of your power to do so...and while your impulses will grow as you age, so will your power. And maybe even that vice tied to your body can be overcome. Perhaps with years or even centuries, you may yet obtain and surpass the full might of the Princess herself...but that night is not tonight.

Such a curious creature, one that has no place in this era, a living relic of what was...what will you do, I wonder?"
