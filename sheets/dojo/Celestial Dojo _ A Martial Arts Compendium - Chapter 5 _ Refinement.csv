1,Free,Laplace Factor,Mushoku Tensei,Refinement,"While magical reserves are determined at birth, there are some exceptions like those with a Laplace Factor
which allows them to grow and expand their magical reserves to a substantial amount during their childhood.
As a jumper you also have this Laplace Factor dialed up to eleven and it won’t disappear once you’re grown. It
lets you expand your magical reserves infinitely by simply depleting your magical reserves and allowing it to
recover. It also grows with time doubling in amount every year even without doing anything. Furthermore, you
also lack the disability of being unable to wear Battle Aura like most beings that have the original Laplace
Factor possess. Should you have multiple types of energy pools, this would allow you to combine it into one
energy pool that has all their advantages and devoid of their drawbacks though you can split them whenever you
wish."
2,50,Motivated to Greatness,Generic Exalted,Refinement,"Choose a Motivation. It must be suitably grand. “I want
to abolish the slave trade and have the Guild openly acknowledge they will not deal in slaves”
counts. “I want to to throw down the corrupt and decadent Monarchy and establish a fair and
equitable government” also counts. “I want to make a really great tasting sandwich” does not,
nor does “I want to live a boring humdrum life”. So long as you are striving towards your
Motivation you will find that your reserves of essence stretch just that little bit further, that your
willpower is just that little bit more resolute, and that your skills and abilities are just that little bit
sharper and just that little bit more refined than they otherwise would be.
Taken individually these changes don’t amount to much, nor do they usually result in anything
too amazing moment to moment, but in the long grind their benefits might just allow you to
realize an otherwise impossible dream."
3,100,The Drifting Iron Body,Cradle V1,Refinement,"This iron body involves undergoing a process to weaken gravity's hold on the body, making you lighter. The normal transformation process involves being woven into a silken cocoon made by refiners from plants that grow among the clouds. It feels like being suspended among hundreds of pillows for several hours a day over many weeks"
4,100,Hidden Spring Iron Body,Cradle V1,Refinement,"This Iron body allows the user to maintain large amounts of water. So-called because they can go a long time without drinking water, so the idea is that they have a ""hidden spring"" inside their bodies and they never have to drink at all."
5,100,Disciple’s Discipline,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Refinement,"­ You have the most important feature of a disciple;
discipline. You will never grow bored or lose focus while training and will receive a modest
boost to your willpower and mental fortitude whenever your master orders you to do something.
Furthermore you will not be dissuaded from training as a result of great physical pain or danger.
In fact, the presence of danger and pain only makes you train harder and may help you improve
your physique faster."
6,100,Used to it,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Refinement,"Having grown up around martial artists everyday, you are no stranger to
combat and the fear of imminent demise. It becomes nearly impossible to traumatize you as a
result of battle. You could be involved in a war and come out of it with no anguish or long term
mental consequences. When faced with dangerous or traumatic situations, you keep a clear and
logical vantage point. You can reasonably make the same judgement calls during a high­stress
circumstance as you would in an academic or armchair discussion."
7,100,"Dominated by Triangles",Baki The Grappler,Refinement,"You have a grasp of your own center of balance and that of your opponent that lets you
render the notions of weight classes all but meaningless. You can move like a lightweight
while dealing hits like a heavyweight, due to how you distribute your mass. This may even
fool the opponents’ senses to think they’re fighting a giant or a puff of smoke. –"
8,100,Animal Instinct,Tekken,Refinement,"You have a primal side. Maybe you’re even an Animal? Either way you find
yourself having strong natural instincts. When there is a danger you can’t beat you know when to run
away. Your reflexes are greatly enhanced, and you can talk with other animals. "
9,100,Intimidation,Toriko,Refinement,"In a world filled with dangerous beasts there will be times when fighting isn't the best solution. Instead of running away however, you have learned the power to either convey just how dangerous you are to those around you. Throwing your intent, menacing glares, a wild shout, or maybe just a simple statement is all it takes to show people and beasts you mean business. This doesn't always mean you can scare away your foes. If something is stronger than you, extremely wild, or possibly lacking in intelligence to know better, your intimidation can fail."
10,100,Grafting,Toriko,Refinement,"With the impressive recovery and regenerative abilities of Gourmet Cells, your body can transcend the limits of biology. With this you can now graft human body parts to yourself with a hundred percent success rate and be able to use them effectively. Even more, you can graft the parts of other species and even plants onto your body to gain their abilities though a talented surgeon is still required."
11,100,One Can Dwell in the Cells,Toriko,Refinement,"As a being born from Gourmet Cells, one could easily manipulate own cellular structure. Stretching, shapeshifting and high speed regeneration come easily to you. No true strength if it comes with the ability to reside in another person's Gourmet Cells. Thanks to it, there will always be two against one in combat, or just assisting with other actions."
12,100,Spartan Discipline,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Refinement,"The training that the Knights of Athena are put
through is nothing short of hellish and soul-rending. That’s why you can both appreciate the
simplicities of everyday life as easily as you can discipline yourself for the battle to come. In
short, you have no difficulty in separating everyday and peaceful life and the stress of battle -
the horrors of war and the adrenaline of a true fight will not surface in your mind until it is
needed, and simple ‘slice of life’ moments are all the more vivid and enjoyable to you for it."
13,100,From The Tides,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Refinement,"The servants of Poseidon are certainly not
landlubbers, and neither are you. You have fantastic swimming abilities and even possess the
ability to breathe underwater just as easily as you do on land, and you suffer no ill effects from
being in the water for too long."
14,100,Weather The Storm,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Refinement,"Through rain or storm, the warriors of the mighty
Sea God must be both vigilant and sturdy against both the elements and their own God’s wrath
upon nature. Outside of battle, your body is a little bit tougher and possesses more stamina for
the purposes of survival or withstanding the elements, letting you walk through a raging storm
as easily as you would a bright and sunny day"
15,100,Ferryman’s Mirth,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Refinement,"Hey, just because you spend all of your time in the
Underworld doesn’t mean you can’t be a bit friendly...sometimes! You have a disarmingly
affable attitude, as well as the ability to enjoy life (or whatever state you exist in) without trouble
or stress on your mind. After all, when everyone’s dead, there’s no point in worrying about
anything."
16,100,Spartan Discipline,Saint Seiya Omega,Refinement,"As a devout follower of Mars, you adhere to the teachings and battle tactics of
the legendary Spartans. Embracing the grueling training regimen of these ancient
warriors, you have honed both your soul and body to the pinnacle of human
endurance. Through relentless discipline and unwavering dedication, you have
forged yourself into a formidable warrior, capable of withstanding the harshest of
trials and emerging victorious against all odds. Moreover, your extensive
knowledge of Spartan battle tactics and weaponry empowers you to excel in
combat, utilizing age-old strategies and techniques to outmaneuver and
overpower your adversaries with ruthless efficiency."
17,100,Taking You Up,Saint Seiya Episode G,Refinement,"Difficult as it may be to admit, the mortals do have power of sorts within them at times. Enjoyable as it may be to, you know, win everything... you can acknowledge when you are testing yourself. You never let your ego, over-sized mind or spirit underestimate any opponent you might have. No matter your bias or ego, if you are raised to a level that may disregard anything from your enemy, you ensure you save for just lacking the needed information. You won’t make mistakes in combat because of your pride nor do stupid things like letting your opponent have an advantage because of your arrogance. Your ego just won’t get ahead of you."
18,100,Tenacity,Feng Shen Ji,Refinement,"Willpower, the drive to keep going no matter what kind of setbacks you face. Even after dead friends, after lost limbs, even after the immense pains of torture; if you can find a reason to live, you won't break. So yes, you can ignore pain and injuries with this perk but they are still present."
19,100,Hellish Constitution,Feng Shen Ji,Refinement,"It’s not surprising that the Underworld is a very inhospitable place. Hence why those who live here have adapted to the myriad of harsh landscapes within this realm. You have also gained a portion of this adaptability by gaining resistances to poison and disease (by half), and even malnutrition; with your body being tough enough to survive a few weeks on low food and water while still operating at full capacity."
20,100,Native,Fist Of The North Star,Refinement,"You live in this damned world and do so surprisingly well. You can survive off a
fraction of the food and water a normal human being would need and can get a full night's sleep even if
you are sleeping on rocks out in the cold."
21,100,Tenryuu Kokuu Hou,Fist Of The North Star,Refinement,"Ordinary men can only use 30% of their muscle's strength, but with
the Art of Dragon's Breathing you can unleash 100% of your body's power at will without little to no
strain. At will you can force yourself to use your maximum power, this is indicated by a glowing aura
and may cause any clothing on your upper body to be disintegrated by your surging muscles."
22,100,Standard Memory Upgrade,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Refinement,"Alchemy is not well
understood. In this world, Alchemists are meant to memorize
thousands of recipes and to be able to reproduce them. This is
what distinguishes various alchemists of different caliber: how
much they memorized. It is different from cutting edge chemistry
from the modern world: “Propose the mechanism for Bimolecular
Nucleophilic Substitutions” becomes “What happens if I put
cabbages and sausages together?”
Now, you too can play their dumb game, your memory gets
boosted enough to the point that memorizing any amount of
formulas become trivial. It can be any type of formula, Cultivation
formulas, Mathematical formulas, Alchemical formulas, anything,
as long as it is a formula."
23,100,Trained Body,Reincarnator,Refinement,"You are a lucky one, before being dragged here your body
was quite strong, roughly twice compared to an average human, so naturally this will
translate well in your survival chances, as such you will begin the <Tutorial> with the
equivalent of possessing 20 in all eight great stats giving you a large head start
compared to others in the <Tutorial>."
24,100,Survival Instincts,Reincarnator,Refinement,"With this perk your most basic instincts are boosted, in
situations of fight or flight you will react, when fighting it increases the users instinct
to predict when or where the opponents would attack allowing them to guard and
counter should they are able to and when running it would instinctively guide the
users when would be the right time to disengage their opponent and run. this doesn’t
make you stronger, just more likely to survive if you don’t understand logically the
level of danger you are facing."
25,100,Hardened Will,Reincarnator,Refinement,"This perk offers a different kind of boost, you are now more
mentally resilient to difficulty in general along with a decent increase in willpower,
you can now simply ignore how poor your living conditions are and keep going
through sheer willpower, this doesn’t lessen your needs, just make you less
emotional about them and push forward in order to survive."
26,100,Healthy Eating,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Refinement,"Being one of the richest and most
prosperous in Swallow Mountain means a lot of things, but what it means the most is that you also
ate a lot of Diremonster meat in your childhood, which is naturally full of minerals and nutrients to
help a growing child. As a consequence, the only word to describe you would be either
“handsome” or “beautiful”, as it is clear that you’re well bred and well raised, and it even shows in
your demeanor, allowing you to present a calm cool facade to anyone giving a casual glance your
way."
27,100,Train the Slayer,Demon Slayer,Refinement,"It wouldn’t do to not have the basics down when out on a mission to hunt for demons. Notably, you have been trained to fight during the night and expect to be attacked at any angle at any time, which means it will be a cold day in the infinity castle when you’re truly caught off guard. This also comes with a basic understanding of how to use a katana, how to maintain it, and the traditional customs for carrying them."
28,100,Evil Destroying Warrior: Yazata,Avesta of Black and White,Refinement,"You are one of the warriors of the side of good. While your power is usually below that of the average Daeva, your physical abilities are still remarkable and put you quite above the regular man. You have enough agility to run faster than most wild animals, and enough strength to destroy buildings easily. You have also trained in the way of the sword, and are quite competent with it."
29,100,Foreign Student,Bleach,Refinement,"With a height like that, it’s no wonder you often got called a delinquent. An extra foot or three of
height for the human sized races, and appropriately more for Hollow forms, plus the natural
strength that comes with such size. It gives a certain intimidating factor to your presence, towering
over almost everyone, but you can show a gentle side when the need comes. If you’re not hostile to
others, your size won’t make them scared of you. In fact, it’s easier than ever to see the kind soul
that lies beneath your outer looks."
30,100,Born With It,The God of High School Jump,Refinement,"You’re one heckuva big guy, even if you’re a God you tower over most of your brethren. Built like a brick shithouse and at least twice the height of any other adult male around you, if it was a contest of just raw muscle power, and not bringing in supernatural powers or training, you’d be pretty much sure to win against any other man on earth. This doesn’t just apply to your form here, if you want to you can give this proportional increase in size to any form or body you are able to take on."
31,100,Demon’s Youth,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Refinement,"That noble spirit suffuses your body, imbuing you with the energy of a wild dragon even in your old
age. The strength of your prime remains with you even as your body ages, bones and muscles never
coming to creak or wither despite your maturing looks. Even abilities or talents that would normally
leave you as you stop being a child remain with you or reappear in time and with some
concentration, you can revert your appearance between different periods in your life, looking young
once again or taking a more adult look. This won’t change your actual age or prevent you from dying
in time but it is useful for disguises and for enjoying the mindset of someone younger than you, still
filled with wonder and innocence that you might have lost in the years since. "
32,100,Philosopher Kings,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Refinement,"The greatest kings and military leaders were more than just warriors and tacticians. They were men
of incredible fortitude beyond the simple body, with wills to push forward against the impossible for
years at a time, so that they could grasp victory. They were more than fighters, with experience as
philosophers or explorers that they bent towards their goals of conquest. You’re not a great king yet
but you share those beginnings. You’ve got a will like a wall of diamond, incredible hard and near
impossible to break or bend. You might not last forever against everything but it’ll take a damn lot to
make you bend the knee by choice. Your childhood, where you found that will, was spent not just on
military training but also in another field of life of your choice, such as exploring distant lands for
years to experience new cultures or spending time as a notable teacher of the arts at home, which
has given you a wide array of minor skills and experiences that aid you in finding creative solutions
to your enemies."
33,100,Survivor,Chrome Shelled Regios,Refinement,"You are a master of harsh environments, and somehow no longer need to breathe. You can survive in inhospitable environments with severe heat and cold, vacuum, pressure, etc that can now be found in the world. While you can survive in these conditions, you still need food and water to survive. "
34,100,Insatiable Stomach,Gourmet Of Another World,Refinement,"High level dishes made with spiritual ingredients normally contain vast amounts of energy which is why they can improve the consumers' cultivation. This also means that you unfortunately can only eat a certain amount. After all, too much energy can become harmful and in a large enough quantity cause you to explode. You however, are special like the child Xiao Ya and you possess a truly insatiable stomach. No matter how much food and energy you absorb you will never become full. In addition there is nothing that can upset your stomach. Even items that are normally toxic or filled with berserk energy will seemingly have no adverse effects on you. 
"
35,100,State of Mind,Gourmet Of Another World,Refinement,"Due to the incredibly precise measurements needed for some steps a good chef must be able to remain calm no matter the circumstances. You have learned to maintain this state. No matter what temptations or challenges you face you will be unfazed. This could be from seeing an unbelievably beautiful woman or it could be the pressure from a supreme expert pressuring you. Any external influence can be ignored and you shall be unaffected.
"
36,100,An Immortal Tongue,Gourmet Of Another World,Refinement,"After reaching a certain point a skilled chef is capable of identifying all of the ingredients used to prepare a dish and experts can even identify all of the steps used to cook it. You have developed your sense of taste to reach this level and go beyond. The most important aspect for this however is that it allows a chef to have absolute precision over the flavors of their dish to make them perfect. 
"
37,100,Such a Dashing Figure,Gourmet Of Another World,Refinement,"When Blacky first arrived at Bu Fangs shop he was a majestic creature inspiring awe with his visage. Unfortunately after he became lazy and enjoyed Bu Fang's cooking every day he became fat and lost his demonic grace. In fact many of the people who frequented Bu Fang’s restaurant suffered from this effect. They ended up becoming fat and had to have limits put on them to protect them. Even Nethery and Flowery had to deal with this. This perk will protect your body from any negative effects. For example, no matter how much you eat your body will always stay in peak condition. This won’t protect you from attacks such as poison, but your body will remain in peak condition no matter how badly you are hurt with this.
"
38,100,Value of a Day’s Hard Work,Beware Of Chicken,Refinement,"To those who have never been on a farm, it can be easy to underestimate
just how much work goes into making a successful one. Long tedious labor
day in and day out throughout the year combined with having to remain
aware of and head off any potential problems. A ton of muscle and brain
power goes into being a successful farmer owner. Luckily, you are mentally
and physically equipped to be a highly successful farmer. Honest labor
comes naturally to you, to the extent you can attain a Zen state simply from
going about the daily work."
39,100,Unfortunate Outstanding Trait,Beware Of Chicken,Refinement,"You have something that stands out about you. Perhaps you have a strong
resemblance to a monkey, or give everyone the feeling of looking at a fox.
No matter what this trait is, it is taken as endearing by those you care for.
That you just happen to be better at activities related to what you resemble
is entirely a coincidence, I’m sure."
40,100,Heavenly God’s Spiritual Veins,Against The Gods,Refinement,"With
this perk, you have all of them open, meaning your cultivation is thrice as fast as the average
person. This perk is free for those who take Supreme Saint of Medicine below. You get equivalent
effects in all future worlds where these things are relevant."
41,100,Wild Devil Screaming at the Heavens,Against The Gods,Refinement,"As things happen, you may end up undergoing a lot
of things that would leave normal people with broken minds and crushed souls. Not you. You have
boundless willpower, meaning you can keep yourself going through pain, terror or horror simply out
of sheer stubbornness.
It also helps you in quickly recovering from old trauma, letting you forget and/or move on
unbelievably quickly. Also, you’re good at insulting people."
42,100,Peak Condition,Dragon Ball,Refinement,"You can maintain your peak state constantly. This means that as long as you have
some energy you can maintain transformations and fight at 100% of your power. For
example, if you only had 10% of your energy left you wouldn’t be any slower or weaker
than your peak state. Just remember that once you run yourself dry you’ll go from a
hundred to zero immediately. You can disable this perk if you wish."
43,100,Attribute Distribution,Dragon Ball,Refinement,"A surprisingly common power up state is the buff mode. This state occurs when a being
floods themselves with power. This greatly increases their strength, but normally
decreases their speed and capacity for rational thought. This ability is useful, but only
for specific situations. Which is exactly why you’ve learned to distribute your attributes.
Somehow you figured out how to transfer your “stats” to increase and decrease each
trait. For example, you could greatly reduce your speed and attack power to greatly
increase your defensive power or strength. The only restriction on this power is that
increasing one attribute requires another decrease."
44,100,I Can Breathe in Space,Dragon Ball,Refinement,"Saiyans possess a variety of powers, but one important ability they lack is the ability to
survive outside of an atmosphere. This ability however, is remarkably common amongst
other species. You are either one of these individuals or you have somehow developed
a technique to counteract this issue. As a result you are able to survive without oxygen,
be unaffected by the freezing temperature of space, and otherwise ignore issues due to
extreme environments. Essentially as long as it can be considered an environmental
effect you will be safe from it. Though you may disable this effect to train your body in
extreme conditions."
45,100,Snow in Summer,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Refinement,"“Snow will only appear during winter,” he said quietly, “and can only exist in the cold wind.
Therefore, its life exists only during the depths of winter.” “Snow can only live in the winter.
When it nears a fire, it dies. That is its life. It may yearn for summer, but... it can only desire it.
“Yearning for summer,” Zheng Yong murmured to himself, “but only able to exist in the cold of
winter. Only able to look off into the distance... that is snow.”
In much the same way, humans change with every moment, and the man that is can only ever
stare wistfully at the man that was. Unless it’s you. Because in you there remains something
altogether... stronger, something deeper. No matter what you undergo, how many trials or
tribulations you endure, there remains a clump of snow that just will not melt. There is a kernel
of you that remains you, come hell or high water, or the end of all things.
This is not to say you can’t learn from life’s lessons, or that you can’t change or grow. But no
amount of change will ever erase the base of what makes you, you. No curse will snare your
mind for very long, and no experiences will make you give into despair or drive you insane for
any meaningful duration.
That is, all those things might still happen, this perk doesn’t make you immune. What it does is
to make sure you always, always recover from any such things. No matter how far gone you

may be, such is your mind that you’ll always rise again, refined and improved by the
experience."
46,100,Easily Amused,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Refinement,"There’s a saying that goes something like “Small things amuse small minds.” Regardless of the
size of your mind, however, this now applies to you. You can amuse yourself and pass time
with absolutely no stimulus for years on end. You are effectively immune to boredom."
47,100,Cultivating Confidence,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Refinement,"There is a lot of philosophy regarding what cultivators truly cultivate. The obvious answer is
that they cultivate their bodies and their souls, to achieve ultimate power and immortality. But
some say that what cultivators actually cultivate is confidence.
If that were true, then you’ve already reached the peak. You are perfectly confident in yourself
and your capabilities, without being overconfident. Your Dao-Heart can never be shaken by
attacks on your confidence and standing or displays of power and might."
48,100,Bottomless Stomach,A Will Eternal,Refinement,"Your ancestry must have had many members from the Ovens in it. All that eating of spiritual
foods has had a strange effect. You never seem to get full no matter how much you eat. You
are no longer limited in how much you can eat in one sitting. On top of that, it never seems
to go to your waist. No more limiting your cultivation simply because you can’t eat anything
more."
49,100,Wyld Surviving Savant,Generic Exalted,Refinement,"- You're tough. Really, unnaturally, ludicrously tough. You can
shrug off hits that would even leave other Exalts reeling and quickly heal even from the wounds
that do get through. Or maybe you’re just benefiting from blatant comic favoritism and stuff that
should have hit solidly just glanced off instead. Either way you're also really good at surviving in
the wild (and even The Wyld) for some reason, even places you've never been to before, and
you gain a complete immunity to all mundane poisons and diseases. Magical poisons and
diseases can still mess you up, but you've got a fair resistance to those as well.
Finally in places of extreme chaotic nature, such as The Wyld, you will find yourself oddly
insulated from the normal consequences of being in such a place. This isn’t total resistance and
it’s still advised you leave while you can, but if it’s just a relatively short visit you could
conceivably survive just fine even in the very heart of The Wyld or other similarly chaotic areas."
50,100,Savant’s Understanding,Infernals Exalted,Refinement,"A good scholar is one that understands quickly, and remembers their lessons well. Gaining a
sharpened mind, you will make connections and associations extremely quickly, your
burgeoning mind filling with ideas and potential solutions. But remembrance is just as
important, so you will find that your memory clear and enjoy near-perfect recall. Indeed, the
memories of life and technology in the First Age, which your Exaltation retains from its past
life as a scholar of note, are likewise quite clear. Even better, you will find it easy to retain
absurd amounts of newly acquired information. For some reason, this also makes it easier
for you to construct elaborate monologues to reveal the full genius of your grand schemes."
51,100,Corpse Laughing in the Face of Jackals,Abyssals Exalted,Refinement,"The Blasphemous are the Deathknights who spread the gospel of death and Oblivion,
preaching the philosophy of the Abyss to the living and the dead, spreading its five
Understandings far and wide. But, before that, it is of foremost importance that Those Who
Speak Blasphemous Truths be sturdy in body and mind so as to carry out their unholy
mission in full.
They, and now you, are those amongst the Deathknights who are hardiest, those who
survive again and again all those things that would kill a lesser man. Those possessed of
unholy zeal, in themselves or their broken faith, such that no argument or setback would
dissuade them from their path. Those who can survive in any environment they should find
themselves in, with nothing but their two hands. All the better for you to serve as a righteous
martyr, enduring the burden of life to guide everyone else into death."
52,100,Peak Performance,Mushoku Tensei,Refinement,"The results of training your mind, body, skills and magic reached perfection which allowed your skills to be
ingrained into the very core of your being. This elevates your physical abilities to be roughly equal to an
Advance-Rank Warrior or Peak Human without Battle Aura and you can maintain this peak form without
further training and can only improve from there. Your mind has also improved, granting you an eidetic
memory with perfect recall and indexing and you can also process a lot more information faster and seal away
any undesirable memories. This also stops any of your physical, mental and magical energy and skills along
with any other aspect of yourself from degrading or atrophying due to lack of use or time."
53,200,Fish Food,UQ Holder,Refinement,"A weak form of Immortality and one that has fallen out of fashion for a few thousand years. Youatethe flesh of a mer-person, way back when they were still around. You ceased to age from the moment you took the first bite and gained a weak healing factor. You can slowly regenerate from most wounds, even things like being cut in half or being decapitated but your healing factor will leave the scars from those wounds on your body, even after the several days it takes to heal serious wounds. You will generally survive anything short of your head being cut off and then crushed or your body being entirely poisoned."
54,200,High Speed Regeneration,UQ Holder,Refinement,"Through many unpleasant experiments, your body has been forcibly remade into something immortal. You will cease to age beyond the point of physical maturity, and you’ve gained an impressive level of physical regeneration. Most wounds can heal within a few short minutes, and even lost limbs can be recovered after a brief rest. However, you cannot heal while something is embedded in you, so be sure to un-impale yourself first. Since healing takes a few minutes, you can be left disabled for a time if sufficiently damaged, and enough damage can still end your life—such as having your head crushed or losing all your organs at once. However, with practice, you can improve your healing rate."
55,200,Old Fashioned Brawler,UQ Holder,Refinement,"Magic? Ki? All a real man needs is their fists! You’re terrifically strong and fast, even without using any kind of supernatural enhancement. You can outrun a bullet and kick down a house, and you’ll only get stronger with training. You’re pretty damn scary in a fight even if you weren’t that strong, tough, and fast, since you’re well trained in a variety of mundane martial arts, particularly focusing on how best to take advantage of your superhuman capabilities and how to fight those with similar or greater abilities. You’re used to taking on guys with magic, Ki, or both while fighting with just your body, and it’s made you more effective against them."
56,200,The Depths-Forged Iron Body ,Cradle V1,Refinement,"Sacred artists seeking to achieve this iron body must subject themselves to increasing amounts of pressure as they channel force madra to every inch of their body to counteract it. Alone this is typically achieved by diving into the depths of the ocean. It is otherwise difficult, but not impossible to replicate this with a well- coordinated team of force madra artists. The main benefits are that their body is incredibly resistant to physical attacks, and also acts to absorb / reflect force-based techniques."
57,200,Blood-forged Iron,Cradle V1,Refinement,"This Iron body has had additional madra channels carved into the body with sandviper poison. This has caused your body’s natural regeneration to increase significantly. For another 100 CP, you can have a body just like Wei Shi Lindon. This will rocket your regeneration speed even further, putting you just below Wolverine or Deadpool provided you can provide enough madra to feed this ability."
58,200,Steel born Iron Body         ,Cradle V1,Refinement,Attained by submerging oneself in a black pool of liquid that burns like a live flame. Must be completely under the surface of liquid (using an apparatus or reed of some sort to breathe) for three days and three nights. This pool was reported to cause extreme pain to the point that the individual exposed to it thought they were dead. It only shows its real use past the True gold level and generates increased amounts of power via momentum. The longer the fight the stronger the body becomes.
59,200,Raindrop Iron Body,Cradle V1,Refinement,"To attain this Iron body, the practitioner must play games that focus on speed and hand-eye coordination. Such games include (but are not limited to): catching birds as they run off, running as fast as possible, and hitting balls with sticks. This Iron body is usually attained by those whose eyes, senses, or “detection” are faster than their hands. It is said that an individual with this Iron body should “...be able to thread through drops in a rainstorm without getting wet...” hence its name."
60,200,Toad School Technique,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Refinement,"Whether you bred insects into your skin, altered your own body with sorcery or surgery, or something else, your body has some type of natural weapon. It can also be hidden well, so no need to cover it up, though you should not make it obvious."
61,200,Self-aware,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Refinement,"We are all flawed, but YISUN likes it that way. Perfection is boring, and weakness defines us as much as our strengths. You must be a follower of YISUN, it seems, as you are aware of your strengths, your flaws, your everything. You know who you are, and that is a gift within itself."
62,200,Self Sanctity,"A Cultivator's Beginning",Refinement,"The refinement process that cultivators undergo isn’t confined to just the body and the soul, but also the mind. This world is indifferent at best, cruel at worst. To survive in it, you need to conform to its rules.

Something is typically lost in the process, something precious.

You won’t lose anything though, not to this world, nor to the monsters that inhabit it. No matter what you experience, no matter how far you travel from home, you will continue to grow into the person that you truly want to be.

Even if you become a god so far beyond mortality that you can’t even remember how long you’ve been alive and no matter what you had to do to climb that high, you will not lose the parts of yourself that you consider important."
63,200,"Perfect Memory
","A Cultivator's Beginning",Refinement,"You possess perfect technical retention and execution, meaning that your skills and knowledge never degrade from lack of use. You’ll be able to take that one obscure skill you learned hundreds of years ago, and perfectly execute it, as if you had been practicing it devoutly the entire time.

You also gain a perfect memory that allows you to remember everything that's happened, as well as the ability to selectively seal memories that you don’t want to remember."
64,200,Strength and Endurance,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Refinement,"You are strong. INCREDIBLY strong. You have
trained in techniques meant to increase your physical strength and endurance far beyond that of
normal people. Your strikes hit with the force of trucks and could easily damage cars or shatter
concrete blocks. It will only increase with time and training and you may yet find yourself
lifting tanks over your head with only moderate strain. You are also durable enough that you
will not be damaged by the use of your own strength, and will never run out of strength at a
critical moment from a lack of stamina."
65,200,Speed and Agility,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Refinement,"You are fast. VERY fast. You have trained and continue to
train in techniques that will allow you to move at incredible speed with great agility. You will be
able to run as fast as automobiles and with training these speeds will increase in time. You are
also physically coordinated enough to engage in olympic level gymnastics with ease, and by
extension move with the seemingly effortless grace of a top­tier ballerina."
66,200,Perception and Awareness,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Refinement,"You are a highly perceptive individual with senses
that are above and beyond peak human. Your eyesight is likely at least 20/15 and you can easily
hear a whispered conversation across a crowded room. You also gain greater situational
awareness of your surroundings, passively taking in minute data that will let you more easily
determine what will come next and may forewarn you of ambushes, traps or impending disasters.
While not perfect it will be much harder to surprise or sneak up on you."
67,200,"He Who Realized this Miracle",Baki The Grappler,Refinement,"A selfish example you are, possessing both legs and arms of a champion. Henceforth, the
power of your arms will never fall behind that of your legs and vice versa, just as your
striking power will never fall behind your running speed and vice versa. Become the
greatest with one, and accomplishments in the other won’t be far behind."
68,200,"A Capricious Man You Are",Baki The Grappler,Refinement,"Sometimes the simplest solution is the best. You are tough, impossibly so. Your bones are
like steel, and your muscles are dense enough to take buckshot with only a few scratches,
and your metabolism will instantly heal that with a single hearty meal. With just a little
practice, you can develop advanced muscle control. –"
69,200,"I Will Protect You",Baki The Grappler,Refinement,"You have a keen sense for detecting traps and killing intent, and how to hide your own.
Your mind is rarely not on war, such that you are always analyzing your surroundings,
always thinking about other’s strengths and weaknesses, and making sure you always
have a library of backup plans to take down or escape anyone you meet. "
70,200,On Foot,Street Fighter,Refinement,"Motion sick? Don't have enough cash for a car and gas? Maybe you just like taking
the scenic route. Whatever the case may be, you've made a habit of walking everywhere, even on
long trips around the world. How do you cross the sea? How should I know.
 This perk greatly aids with quick, efficient, long distance travel on foot. You gain a hefty increase
to your stamina, and good fortune with getting where you wanna go such that detours or rough
terrain are rarely an issue. Need to get to the other side of the world and prefer walking? You'll get
there eventually, somehow, and it'll take less time than you'd think."
71,200,Dynamic Vision,Toriko,Refinement,"The shape of the target, the expansion and contraction of their muscles, the movement of their joints, and their breathing. From every piece of information gained, you can easly predict the next move of your opponent. Things like roulette machines are a joke and it's possible for you to follow an arrow in flight with your eyes. With enough training, you can even see bullets and more esoteric projectiles coming at you."
72,200,Will to Fight,Toriko,Refinement,"You have unmoved fighting will, that will not budge in face of overwhelming adversary, similar to what happened to Toriko with his fight against Heracles. Even in an event where over half of your body was blown away, there will be willpower to fight further. Only death is the thing that may stop that fighting spirit and even then it could not be enough if you have enough willpower."
73,200,Cryptobiosis***,Toriko,Refinement,"The Nitro can enter a state of metabolic dormancy in which they can hibernate for centuries without food or water and allow them to survive numerous mass extinction events, as recounted by Chief Mansam. With that perk, Jumper can easily enter a state of dormancy for a long time, even billions of years. One drop of water is capable of waking you from that state. After awakening from dormant state, you gain one time boost to your physical stats in order to hunt and devour beasts in order to regain your old strength from centuries ago. That strength boost could be only used to find nutritious food.
"
74,200,Believe,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Refinement,"Power is nothing without something worth fighting for! At
the start of a new journey or quest, you may devote yourself to a single ideal or belief of your
choosing. When fighting for this ideal in any fashion, your willpower becomes tempered and
stronger. As Cosmo is enhanced by willpower and emotion, this adds fuel to the fire of your
heart, giving you a slight boost in burning said Cosmo."
75,200,Crane’s Cool,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Refinement,"In front of evil, it is normal to be afraid. To fear is to be human, to rise above it like you is a feat. You always keep your head cool in most situations, not to say every, able to think clearly even in the heat of combat. Unless your entire family is murdered in front of you or someone medle with your mind, you’ll never make a mistake because of the heat of the action."
76,200,Behemoth’s Resilience,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Refinement,"To better serve Hades and the three Judges, some nurture their mind, while others refine their technique. You however took a more… straightforward way. You trained your body again and again, enough so that when confronted with someone in your league, you can reasonably expect to be more resilient and stronger physically than him."
77,200,A Loving Heart,Saint Seiya Episode G,Refinement,"This world can be a harsh place at times but it is only through the efforts of those with love in their hearts that it remains as peaceful as it normally is. No matter what you go through or how you end up, you’ll find you always have a vast wellspring of positive emotions waiting inside your heart that you can reach into to suffuse your mind and body with. It makes you far more resistant to attempts to break your hope or cause you to despair, as well as allows you to easily bypass any protections that require one to feel love or happiness in great amounts."
78,200,My Heart is Open,Fist Of The North Star,Refinement,"You do not need eyes to see. Your training allows you to utilize your ki
in a variety of ways. Obviously as a member of the Nanto Sects you can make slashing waves of
energy and use an empty hand to cut through steel with this power, but you can also use it to see in the
dark, or after tearing out your own eyes."
79,200,Body Fitness Unlocked,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Refinement,"You will find it easier to
gain strength. Your physical training will always give you two
times the normal gains. Additionally, you will not become huge
physically if you don’t want to, and this will have no effect on
your strength."
80,200,Ruthlessness,Reincarnator,Refinement,"If there’s a lesson this place has to offer is this one, that
weak-minded people don’t last long, luckily you have learned that lesson early on,
being able to rationalize and deal with any situation no matter how costly may be,
with no emotional baggage, because sometimes all that matters is pushing forward
no matter the cost."
81,200,Against the Hordes,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Refinement,"Every day is full of hardship when you
belong to a small tribe, never knowing when another tribe or a particularly strong Diremonster
might spell doom for you and everyone around you, having to deal with the troops of the
superpowers, and finally your own tribemates’ bickering. All of it is enough to make a man go
insane, yet after years of such stress, you’ve stopped being bothered by it. Your mind can easily
take stress that would make others shells of their former selves, not to mention your ability to stay
calm and hold steady in the face of danger. In a way, you’ve truly ascended past your mortality
before even becoming Immortal."
82,200,Grew up in the Wilds,Demon Slayer,Refinement,"You were raised in the mountains, maybe even by wild animals that accepted you as one of their own, but in either case you are now more adaptable than others would normally be. Your body is more resistant to poison, you are very flexible, and you have an aura that allows you to understand and command normal animals, easily able to join the pack or become the leader."
83,200,To the last Breath,Demon Slayer,Refinement,"Say what you will, but the most dedicated demon slayers have something that drives them forward more than others. This gives you the unbreakable willpower to continue on even if everyone else would be driven to despair, remaining calm in the face of a superior enemy, allowing you to push through and make the hard decisions, you would even be able to continue fighting with a fist through your gut, so long as it doesn’t instantly kill you. 
"
84,200,"Against TIme
Ageless",Avesta of Black and White,Refinement,"Another trait commonly found in the stronger Dagravant. While the Ashavan bow before the
natural order of things and see old age and natural death as something that should be
respected, the more powerful Daeva instead trend to use their own powers to keep their life
going forever. However, only the mightiest of them can keep going for centuries or more.
Whatever methods you have used, your lifespan is now basically endless, unless violence ends
your life. Not only that, but you are also especially suited for the trials of immortality, as your
mind and ego are well suited to your long existence, maintaining themselves fresh regardless of
how much time passes, instead of degrading before the ravages of time."
85,200,Flower of Chivalry,Campione,Refinement,"You have come a long way in your training, always holding code of chivalry in your mind and actions, you became able to apply it without doubt or complications even in a grey world like this. You possess the heart of a lion which never backs down, the leadership of a true captain, the mind of a great strategist and the luck required in finding a worthy master to serve and gain greater glory for you both. Truly you are what all other knights aspire to be. It’s not only your heart which holds strong, but also your mastery over magic and swordsmanship is now equal to any Great Knight."
86,200,Sharpened Mind,Bleach,Refinement,"If you’re not just a brute that fights with overpowering strength, it’s important to know what the
enemy can do and will do. Judging opponents has been a talent of yours since your youth, helping
you quickly piece together the capabilities of an enemy even from just small hints. With both
physical senses and the use of reiatsu sensing, you can tell a lot about others. The way they use their
Shikai will tell you a lot more than they’d like to let on. If they try to set up traps or feints, you’ll
usually see through pretty easily and be able to figure out a way to turn it to your advantage. Even
outside of combat, this sort of observational skill can tell you quite a bit about other people, letting
you make scarily accurate guesses about what they’d do in certain situations once you’re familiar
with them."
87,200,Clog Wearing Menace,Bleach,Refinement,"Sometimes a man is too clever. They get caught up in schemes to conquer the world and account for
every variable, so much that they become predictable. You’re not smart enough to match them on
an equal playing field, just smart enough to realise what they expect of you and how to play against
those expectations. They unconsciously rely on their preferred stereotypes and desires. This quickly
attained knowledge lets you act with unpredictability and chaos, tripping up the plans of these super
geniuses that consider themselves above everyone. If they really are a mental giant compared to
your mind, it might not work so well, but you’re more than capable of making a lot of complications
in the plans of the mighty and powerful. In a fight however, these traits make you quite the terror, concealing your intended actions from opponents with the experience or skill to predict them. All the easier to lay some tricks and traps of your own on them. "
88,200,Thought Acceleration ,Tsukihime,Refinement,"Even a human brain operating at peak capacity has its limits - it is, after all, what amounts to biological hardware with set limitations.But what if those limitations could be surpassed? You are able to accelerate your thought processes to twice their normal speed, letting you quickly multitask and react faster than body and nervous system would normally allow, running calculations and strategies in a blink rather than a minute. In time, you could even accelerate this to three, or four or more times in speed. However, much like overclocking a computer, this is a stressful technique that is exhausting,and if overused, can burn your brain out like an overheated engine. Practice and careful moderation may let you overcome this, but for now, be cautious in how you use this.
"
89,200,Time to Pull Out My Big Gun,The God of High School Jump,Refinement,"You really weren’t kidding when you told those guys you weren’t left handed. One of your limbs is way, way stronger than the other. This isn’t just about which hand you write with. If your left hand could break a brick in one punch, your right hand could smash a two story brick house in one go. Hell, if you’re not careful about remembering which is which, you could really do some damage by just shaking someone’s hand. Which limb is this much stronger is up to you and you can even buy it multiple times, though you’ll only be able to buy one side of any pair or group. You can’t have both arms be much stronger than normal but you can make an arm and a leg be this much more awesome.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
90,200,Majestic Sculptor of Worlds,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Refinement,"Many Ōtsutsuki are known for performing
feats of gigantic proportions that in the eyes of mere mortals are truly godlike, such
as Shibai that was known for casually being able to generate storms with a mere
wave of his hand and to call forth thunderbolts with just an angry roar. Many of these
feats are the result of enhancing techniques and other abilities by using even more
power on them, with a case that perfectly exemplifies this is the usage of Rasengan
by Momoshiki that amplifies its size from being hand-sized into a gigantic scale.
However, merely adding more energy without any care into a technique is usually
pretty inefficient and may make it more unstable. Fortunately, as a result of
specializing yourself in this, acquired experience over the cycles or due to an innate
affinity with enhancing techniques over their regular limit, you’re now able to fuel any
technique and/or ability you have to with any amount of power without needing to
worry about any loss of efficiency or instability caused by it, allowing you to both
enhance them by fueling them with additional power or use weaker versions of them
by limiting the energy you use."
91,200,Stamina Monster,Chrome Shelled Regios,Refinement,"You are one of the lucky ones you can fight for days at a time with little to no sleep. Your stamina is the stuff of legends and you fight constantly for up to a week before your stamina runs out, and speaking of sleep you only need 5 hours of sleep to completely recover from fatigue and energy loss. "
92,200,Supreme Body ,Gourmet Of Another World,Refinement,"There are numerous different types of cultivation that exist in this world. One of the methods displayed here is the school of body cultivation techniques. These techniques allow the user to refine their bodies to the point that they are as strong as artifacts if not even further beyond. This perk grants two main effects. First your body shall be specially suited for these techniques allowing you to rapidly strengthen your body. Second, your body is simply much tougher than others of your level. As a human you would be capable of matching a powerful spirit beast with your physical strength alone."
93,200,Under Sea Escades,Gourmet Of Another World,Refinement,"Whenever someone from the land travels beneath the seas they will be restricted by the environment and be unable to exert their maximum combat prowess. Similarly sea creatures can experience a similar effect when they stay on land. This perk allows you to function at your best regardless of where you are. If you are underwater then you will flow with the water rather than against it. Should you be an Oceanic being then being on dry land will not affect you. This will protect you from other environments as well. It won’t stop damaging effects such as lava burning you, but the heat will not impede you while you are there."
94,200,Life of a Mortal,Gourmet Of Another World,Refinement,"It’s rather ironic that cultivators who pursue immortality in order to leave their mortal lives inevitably end up returning. There is a special peace within the simplicity of a mortal's life. This peace is one that you have held onto and one that you will never abandon. No matter how strong you become or what experiences you undergo you will always retain this peace. This will provide a number of benefits to you as you pursue your own path. The most obvious one is that you will never be guided down the wrong path. You will always follow your own path and perhaps even pave the way for others. 
"
95,200,The Lonely Path,Cradle,Refinement,"- Oftentimes, you'll have to figure something out on your own. Be it a
new technique, an application of an old skill, or a strategy for beating a specific opponent. With
this, you can look to yourself for inspiration, taking an outward perspective of your own thoughts
and examining them from new angles to help further progress yourself and grow stronger. You
can even go so far as to ""hallucinate"" a mock opponent to try new ideas out on, though they
aren't exactly a real sparring partner."
96,200,Binding Creation,Cradle,Refinement,"As a Sacred Artist uses a technique repeatedly, it becomes easier
and more ingrained into their soul, to the point that when they die, their Remnant carries a
Binding with the ability to use that Technique. With this, you'll reach that level of expertise with
one Path Technique instantly. You can develop the technique however you like, but keep in
mind that most Paths limit themselves to one or two techniques of each ""type"". Striker
Techniques are your typical beams, blasts, and other direct attacks, and good for distance
engagement. Enforcer Techniques enhance your body or soul in some way, and are typically
good in close combat. Forger techniques involve turning your Madra into a solid substance, and
can either be used for attacks, defense, or utility depending on the type of technique. Ruler
Techniques involve affecting the Vital Aura around you in some way, and usually come with
wide-ranging effects, such as creating a field of illusions, causing sword aura to solidify into
temporary blades to deflect blows, etc. What you design as a Technique is up to you, but keep
in mind that most Techniques don't grow truly powerful until significant Advancement has
occurred, even with skill."
97,200,Split Core,Cradle,Refinement,"This Perk allows you to take two different Paths, or
leave one of your Cores as Pure while utilizing the other one for other needs. Because you have
two Cores now, each the same size as the original. This also comes with the ability to further
split your core at will, though it takes at least six months of preparing each time you do it, and
further cores will only be half the size instead of full-size. If you buy this multiple times, it will
only create one new full-size core each time (so buying it twice would give you three cores,
three times for four cores, etc)."
98,200,Core Expansion,Cradle,Refinement,"The amount of Madra you can hold in your soul at any one time is
doubled, allowing you to use your abilities much longer without wearing down."
99,200,Firm Foundations,Dragon Ball,Refinement,"Many individuals choose to focus on rapidly raising their raw power. This does increase
their power, but it often leaves them a weak foundation. Having a weak foundation
makes it harder to break through and prevents you from fully unleashing your strength.
In order to deal with this issue you have carefully managed your foundation solidifying it.
This firm foundation will never be shaken making future breakthroughs easier.
Additionally, by refining this foundation even further you can become more powerful
than other individuals at your level."
100,200,Heart Like Still Water,Dragon Ball,Refinement,"Korin is an experienced martial artist over 800 years old. He may not be a powerful
warrior, but few have mastered the fundamentals like he has. Perhaps you were his
pupil as you have mastered these principles as well. The most important of which is
control. You have refined your body and ki gaining absolute control over every
movement. This allows you to manipulate your energy with immense precision and
ensure that nothing you do is wasted. Even the simplest move you make will be done
with absolute efficiency."
101,200,Biting Tongue,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Refinement,"Some people might call it insolence, but certainly it’s just your blinding wit? You have a devilish
tongue now, Jumper. A mind quick as lightning, you can come up with painful, stinging insults
for anyone and everyone, and have a grasp of debating and logic that always leaves people
frustrated.
More than that, you have an indomitable will that would hold out even against the literal will of
the Universe around you, and a mastery of logic and arguing tactics that allows you to hold
your ground against the best and the worst with equal ease. They might be able to kill you, but
they’ll never be able to out-argue you."
102,200,A Ruthless Heart,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Refinement,"As an elder cultivator, you’ve surely seen many things in your time. You’re certainly made some
difficult decisions too, the kinds of things that would haunt a man forever. But it’s never kept
you down, never touched your heart.
When you choose to, you may make decisions in a purely rational, utterly ruthless manner.
Killing your children to advance your cultivation, allowing your entire clan to be annihilated so
that the pain that their deaths bring allows you to break through a bottleneck, planning for
99% of your entire world to be killed so that the remaining 1% can survive and thrive...
All of these things and worse, you can do without hesitation or regret if you wish. This is
purely voluntary and won’t affect your decision making or personality."
103,200,Just An Old Painter,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Refinement,"How could anyone ever imagine that your seniority was anything but the failing lifeforce of an
elderly mortal? Not a shred of power, cultivation or profundity to be found. And yet... That’s
not true at all, is it?
You can completely control any and all traces or signs of power and significance that you might
emanate. Even before mighty Immortals and Paragons, you get to choose exactly what you will
appear as, be it nothing but a mortal man, completely devoid of any power or relevance, your
true strength, or something in between."
104,200,Self Mending Meditation,Generic Exalted,Refinement,"Maybe you actually have regeneration. Maybe you’ve
internalized the cosmic fact that pain and injury are simply a state of mind, ephemeral and
temporary. Either way however you heal at a phenomenally quick pace, significantly superior to
even other exalts. Lesser injuries might fade within minutes, severe injury with hours, and even
the most critical and life threatening injuries in no more than a day or two. Additionally you never
scar, and if you’ve got time to actually sit down and rest your recovery rate actually gets
appreciably faster.
But it’s not just physical injuries that this helps. Even damage to your mind can be recovered, if
you have suffered from such, and you can recover from any injury up to and including
amputation so long as you have some time. Naturally, however, missing limbs do take longer to
recover from. A final boon, and perhaps the most important some would argue, you recover
your expended reserves of essence at twice the regular speed even when you are exerting
yourself, and three times as quickly when you are completely at rest. ‘Even when you are
exerting yourself’ does not mean it affects mote recovery from stunts."
105,200,Demon Realm Traveller,Infernals Exalted,Refinement,"Malfeas is not a nice place to be. High above the Green Sun shines down its merciless rays,
the acid seas of Kimbery occasionally flood the streets and vapors rise from it to condense
into acid rains, the swamp of Metagaos consumes all that enters its territory, corrosive vitriol
flows throughout the entire realm, the air is toxic to mortals, lethal winds of Kalmanka and
her progenitor Adorjan slaughter everything in their path, and various demons and
behemoths roam throughout, the greatest of which uncaringly trample vast areas underfoot.
Even time is not consistent through the Demon City, either. Five days in one part of hell
might be one day elsewhere, or ten.
If one of the Princes of hell wishes to survive travelling throughout the demon realm, they
must be hardened against its dangers, and so you have been. You could bathe in the acid
waters of Kimbery, frolic among Kalmanka’s flying razors without harm, and even survive the
passing of the Silent Wind. Even in realms not composed of the broken bodies of the
Architects of Creation, you will find yourself exceedingly resistant to environmental dangers.
Yet as great as this protection is, it will not provide any respite from deliberate attack. If
some being turned their attention directly towards you, it will fall solely to your own defences
to protect you."
106,200,Crystal Clarity,Infernals Exalted,Refinement,"The Principle of Hierarchy is methodical, analytical, and utilitarian to a fault. Such ruthless
efficiency cannot be attained while burdened by such distractions as emotions and stray
thoughts.
As such, you have learned to induce in yourself, with a small exertion of will, a state akin to
She Who Lives In Her Name herself. While you do so, your emotions are suppressed, your
thoughts are ordered, and your mind is sharpened to absurd degrees. In this way you may
coldly calculate how to best accomplish your goals without distraction, unnecessary exertion,
or delaying.
Through this understanding, even your voice has gained some fragment of her own
harmony. From now on, you may speak in a perfect voice like crystal chimes, and with
practise you could even tune your voice further to reproduce sounds of any tone, pitch, and
length in perfect detail.
Deaden emotion. Gain clarity of purpose. Exemplify Order."
107,200,Irresistible Force,Infernals Exalted,Refinement,"TINY ONE.
SHOULD YOU LET ANOTHER COMMAND YOU? SHOULD YOU FEAR THAT WHICH IS
POWERFUL? SHOULD YOU EVER GIVE UP?
NO.
YOU ARE CHOSEN.

LET YOUR WILL BE ALL THAT HOLDS SWAY OVER YOU, AND NEVER STAY YOUR
COURSE FOR ANOTHER.
LET NOTHING STAND IN THE WAY IN THE WAY OF YOUR GOALS.
SHATTER THE LIMITS OF YOUR BODY, AND PUSH YOURSELF BEYOND THE BRINK.
IGNORE PAIN OR INJURY. IGNORE OBSTACLES. FALL NOT TO HARDSHIP OR
DOUBT.
JUST. GO.
AND IF YOUR WILLPOWER WOULD ALREADY BE STRONG, THEN LET YOUR WILL
NOW BE UNBREAKABLE.
Ahem. As you may have gathered from my incomparable progenitor’s speech, this will
bolster your willpower greatly, and allows you to force your body to keep going despite how
broken and bloody you might be, on pure grit."
108,200,Meditative Transcendence,Infernals Exalted,Refinement,"Hell’s priesthood is reserved to Cecelyne, but infernal ascetics, of which there are many,
have made Qaf their road and their temple. While Cecelyne’s bleak infinities crush the soul,
Qaf’s impossible summit offers a strange sort of hope to these pilgrims, as they search for
their own enlightenment. So too may you partake of this hopeful transcendence, for you
have gained wisdom on the slopes of the Heaven-Violating Spear and transcended worldly
concerns. Your mind and spirit shall ever be cast forward, ceaselessly passing through the
numberless stations of enlightenment even in daily life, such that your wisdom and
understanding is always on the path of bettering yourself. You will know peace and
contentment now, wheresoever you shall go from here."
109,200,Impossible Dedication,Mushoku Tensei,Refinement,"Your work ethic is legendary and your will is steel. In the middle of combat you are calm and collected and are
unlikely to lose composure no matter what situation you face. When you’re training or studying to improve
yourself, you’ll never grow bored no matter how tedious and repetitive the process is. This also allows you to
ignore pain and wounds, face despair head-on and become immune to temptation. You can push the limits of
your mind and body with willpower alone and pushing yourself in this way is rewarding and pushing your body
even further to the edge of death will result in great gains."
110,200,Boundless Stamina,Mushoku Tensei,Refinement,"Unlike the magicians who tend to be stationary during combat, the warriors need and use more stamina in
combat as they are more likely to run around the battlefield. With this, you have gained boundless stamina that
will allow you to fight and train for a month without resting or sleeping and a year if you decide to push
yourself. You would only need to rest or sleep an hour per month to fully recover your stamina and mental
fatigue and return to peak condition and a full day should push yourself like fighting or training for an entire
year. This also removes muscle pains and cramps from not exercising for too long or stretching first before
doing a strenuous activity."
111,300,Resonant Iron Body ,Cradle V1,Refinement,"An iron body that absorbs, traps, and remember force madra one encounters. They seek out raging waterfalls, crushing depths, fierce storms and bone shaking earthquakes all to add to the ever-growing stockpile of force aura thrumming within their bodies."
112,300,The Crimson Furnace Iron Body,Cradle V1,Refinement,"This Iron body involves stuffing yourself to bursting and then using life madra to accelerate your body, so that you digest it quickly. After about two weeks of this, combined with some pills developed for the purpose, your body becomes able to do it naturally. It's a great all-purpose Iron body; they are able to receive further benefits from elixirs that improve the body, and much of what they eat strengthens them and makes them tougher. The only downside is an accelerated metabolism: now they HAVE to eat all the time."
113,300,Geas,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Refinement,"Knights of this order always have a single goal, one that differs between each knight. Some choose to help people, others to restore a king, and so on. By focusing on what you want to accomplish, nothing can change your mind from what you need to do. Whether it's torture, mental influence, or simple manipulation, your mind can simply not be changed from your goal."
114,300,Unbreakable Will,"A Cultivator's Beginning",Refinement,"A normal person without an enormous amount of determination and will would not survive this dangerous world.

You gain an unbreakable will and determination that would allow you to ignore pain and wounds, become unmoved by temptations, and face despair head on while allowing you to push the limits of your mind and body with willpower alone.

This also gives you an immunity to powers or techniques that have negative or harmful effects on your mind."
115,300,"Perfect Foundation
","A Cultivator's Beginning",Refinement,"A solid foundation is one of the pillars that support cultivators in advancing. An unstable and shallow foundation would often lead to a failed breakthrough and at worst, death.

With this, you have a perfect and regenerating foundation. Your foundation automatically corrects any imperfections and defects in your cultivation caused by using external materials like pills, treasures, wrong cultivation techniques, and many more.

Additionally, should your cultivation base be crippled, be it one or all three cultivation systems, you can recover it with a month’s worth of waiting or faster if you actively try to fix it.

Any conflicts with using two or more cultivation systems will be prevented, going so far as to allow you to progress in a system even when it should be impossible due to the nature of your advancements in the others."
116,300,Master’s Body,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Refinement,"­ You possess the body of a master. You are
very near tireless, capable of fighting for days without sleep and only limited food. You never
run out of breath, and will still be able to engage in vigorous physical activity even after extreme
exercise. You now have access to a limitless logarithmic growth of your physical strength, speed
and agility."
117,300,Youth and Longevity,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Refinement,"It is a sad truth that with age, the body declines. A once
great master so vibrant in youth possesses less than 1/5th his full strength in old age. You are
different however; by adhering to a certain set of simple daily exercises and dietary restrictions,
you will never age, remaining youthful with all the appearance and skills you held in your prime
of life. Similarly, your physical attributes will never decay and you can expect to live at least
five times the normal human life expectancy. It may be possible to train others in these
techniques but they too will need to abide by the exercise regimen and dietary restrictions."
118,300,The Cretaceous Man,Baki The Grappler,Refinement,"You are someone who can call the likes of Dinosaurs your
prey, and your rivals, and it shows. If it’s bite is weaker than
a tyrannosaurus, you can survive it, if it flies slower than a
pterodactyl, you can catch it, if it’s less sturdy than a
triceratops, you can break it. An opponent who cannot rival
or surpass the might of the monsters you’ve already felled
can hardly challenge you. Of course, this hardly impacts a
foe who relies on trickery, weapons, or techniques well
beyond anything the Cretaceous period could muster. "
119,300,"The Wall of Sound",Baki The Grappler,Refinement,"Using your body as a weapon has its drawbacks. When using attacks that places immense
strain on your body, you’ll find it significantly easier to use on future attempts with a
negligible loss of power. An attack that completely destroyed your arm initially could
afterwards be used repeatedly at 80% power, and maybe 100% soon enough. "
120,300,"Even “He” Could Never Go That Far",Baki The Grappler,Refinement,"You’re simply too stubborn to die, and the only way to keep you down is to instantly kill
you or shatter your pride. Drug overdoses, poisons, and diseases are non-factors for you.
If your will holds up, it doesn’t matter whether your knees are shattered or your neck
broken, you’ll stand back up to continue the fight, logic be damned. –"
121,300,(Wo)Man On A Mission ,Street Fighter,Refinement,"There's no stopping you once you've made up your mind. Not the
threat of losing your job or life, not insurmountable odds and certainly as hell nothing like the word
""impossible"".
 Upon purchase, you acquire an incredible boost to both determination and willpower that allows
you to push through even the longest, most drawn out and terrifying, monotonous or sickening tasks
if that is what you so desire.
 Not only that, but when you have a specific goal in mind that you're working towards, probability
has a way of giving you small encouragements here and there to increase your chances of success.
The villain might think today is a good day to monologue just a bit longer than usual which allows
your backup to arrive.
 You might get a spontaneous lead on an old cold case through a series of coincidences. It's nothing
you can actively control, and you might not even notice it working for you half the time, but it's a lot
of little things that build into something more over time. Of course, there are limits to what you can
endure and odds too large to actually, challenge, so staying smart would help you out too."
122,300,Food Honor,Toriko,Refinement,"While learning Food Honor the body will begin to auto-correct its movements, removing all actions deemed unnecessary and increasing concentration. This allows more efficient use of calories, granting greater stamina, speed, and power. Food Honor affects different people in different ways, for a Bishokuya it increases his overall power and calorie consumption. For a chef to increase the delicacy in his movements, it allows the Chef to prepare Ingredients so carefully, that the Ingredients are unaware that they have been handled.
"
123,300,A Grizzly Appearance,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Refinement,"Apparently sometime during your
childhood, a Diremonster mistook you for its own child and ended up raising you for several years.
It is easy to see how it made this mistake, however, because your appearance mirrors this
particular Diremonster, and so does whatever facet of their abilities is the strongest with them.
Choosing an Azure Skysnake, or a beast just as famed for its speed, will result in you being able
to outrun those even a level above you, and your body itself, even if only that of a Ki refiner, can
rival Fiendgod’s in hardiness."
124,300,Born a Titan,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Refinement,"Gods are meant to be the most high... the most powerful. And yet there are humans who are able to briefly rival such strength. All who attempted to outmuscle a God fail tragically, like Lu Bu and Raiden showed. However, the strength to injure and endure does have its obvious perks. Your physical capabilities are roughly of the likes of the aforementioned warriors, allowing you to possible stall even the Mighty Thor and Shiva in battle."
125,300,No.00000000001 ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Refinement,"It was man that were made in Gods image. It was man that were crowned to rule the land and its animals. And it was the first man Adam who embraced their exile from Heaven when his wife was tricked and threatened by Gods not worthy worship. You now possess the power of the First Man. The Eyes of the Lord. A terrific power that would allow you to perfectly replicate any move and technique you lay your eyes upon, including the ones used by divine beings. Regardless of its speed or power, you can evade any attack whilst simultaneously countering the attacker with their own move. Even something as powerful and fast as a time-surpassing punch can be replicated and dodged. You can even allow your body to morph in order to execute an attack you copied. However, despite their seemingly unbeatable nature, the Eyes of The Lord do have limits. Using them puts a strain on your nervous system and if pushing the eyes to their limits you will start overheating. Continuing in that state will run the risk of blinding you and making it impossible to use the Eyes. You may yet fall if forced into a war of attrition."
126,300,Spark of Genius,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Refinement,"Like a Thunderbolt in the night enlightens your Genius the World. Nikola Tesla, one of the brightest and most genius man in humanities history, is the only one you can call equal. Your intelligence is simply above your peers, as it takes little to envision incredibly works of technology to advance humanity into a new age. The truth of the universes just wait for you to reach out to them as you can understand them eventually if you dedicate yourself and all you would need are the resources to have the things your mind develops be made realized. Beware those jealous of mind like your own though."
127,300,"
Physique
",Gourmet Of Another World,Refinement,"Occasionally individuals who are blessed by the heavens will be born with superior talents. One of the rarer methods that can appear are physiques. Physiques represent some sort of unique constitution which typically grants immense power or talent to an individual. An example seen in the story is the Scorching Sun Demonic Physique which allows the user to temporarily possess overwhelming combat prowess a dozen times what they normally can utilize. Some more generic examples are a pure yang and pure yin physique normally possessed by men and women respectively. These grants a number of powers such as an absurd regeneration, mastery of fire or ice, and if both are combined allow two cultivators (typically lovers) to experience explosive progress while cultivating. You may choose one of the canon physiques or you may design your own using the examples above as a guide. "
128,300,The Nose Knows,Beware Of Chicken,Refinement,"Actually useful Bloodlines are rare around here, as one would expect.
Congrats, you are the exception and have Cultivator super smell. Choose
between intent/lie smelling and absurd Qi detection to determine your
focus, you’ll still be able to do the other just not as well. The Celestial
Bloodline that spawned this is long faded at best, but maybe that will
change? This also optionally comes with really cute freckles."
129,300,Caught Between Life and Death,Abyssals Exalted,Refinement,"In Creation, Abyssals grow uncomfortable and sick. Creation weakens, unless they swath
themselves in paraphernalia of the grave. Abyssals feel more at home in the Underworld,
where they are praised as heroes and holy champions, but they do not really fit in there
either. Despite appearances, Abyssals are very much alive, which makes them stand out
from their bleak Underworld surroundings. The dead step lightly around them, as wary
mortals do around wild animals. Deathknights’ vitality makes them seem unpredictable and
potentially dangerous to the staid, conservative, unchanging dead. Abyssals fit in most in
shadowlands, since they are caught between life and death in a manner similar to their
surroundings. Yet the denizens of the realms on either side of a shadowland tend to look
askance at their in-between neighbors, fearful of what influence the opposite realm might

exert through the shared territory. For most deathknights, this serves to instill in them a
doubled sense of exiled desolation.
Yet you have found ways to make use of your state as a being with merely one foot in the
grave. For all intents and purposes, you may consider yourself to be living, dead or undead,
whichever state is most favourable to you at the moment, for the truth is you are none and all
of these at once. Though this understanding, you can choose to be considered ""alive"" while
in Creation, respiring essence like living creatures. But being dead means certain things (like
most poisons) won’t have any effect on you. And being undead means you can respire the
necrotic essence of the Underworld. You can choose for spells and magic that affects the
dead not to work on you, or only to work on you when beneficial. From this day forth, your
stand outside the classifications of living, dead, and undead."
130,400,Fruit Of The Tree,UQ Holder,Refinement,"Having consumed a pill made from the fruit of the Fusango Tree, your body has become one with the essence of that tree. Your aging has slowed to a crawl, with a hundred years passing for every single year you actually age. When injured, roots and branches of the Fusango Tree emerge from your wounds, binding your body back together or forming new limbs and organs as needed. This organic, life-energy-based regeneration works quickly enough to be viable even in the heat of combat, though it can potentially be overwhelmed by extreme damage. The plants within you can also be used offensively with some creativity, as they are sturdy and capable of moving at high speeds."
131,400,The Eternal Flame,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Refinement,"Humanity is flawed, as Aesma created them solely to have their own creation. But in this weakness, there is strength. You never give up, no matter what the multiverse throws at you. Maybe you can be so stubborn that even in the face of god, you can spit in it."
132,400,Diamond Soul,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Refinement,"It seems that, some time in the past, you studied a Shard of the Worldstone, a massive gem that was destroyed over 30,000 years ago. Through this studying, you have learned how to allow your body to take on Gem-like properties. When using this power, so long as you don’t move, you can’t be knocked back or down, and even a regular human who has this power would be as durable as a diamond, and this scales with how durable you are."
133,400,Unstoppable Will,One Punch Man,Refinement,"No matter the challenge, you are never discouraged or defeated. Your willpower is unshakable, and nothing can break your spirit. Whether you're facing down unbeatable foes or enduring the monotony of everyday life, you push through without hesitation. Your mental fortitude is so great that mind control, fear-inducing abilities, and other psychological attacks are rendered completely ineffective against you. Nothing can sway you from your path, and you always rise to the occasion, no matter how dire the situation."
134,400,Unbreakable Focus,One Punch Man,Refinement,"In battle, your mind is as sharp as your sword. Once you commit yourself to a fight, nothing can break your concentration. Distractions, feints, and even surprise attacks fail to phase you. Your laser-focused mind allows you to remain calm and composed in the most intense situations, making you impossible to throw off balance. With this focus, you can maintain peak performance in any battle, delivering each strike with flawless precision. Your discipline and unshakeable will make you a truly terrifying opponent."
135,400,The King of Iron Fist,Tekken,Refinement,"You are truly worthy of the title. Your strength is incredible and will too
fight unwavering. When pushed to your limits you could match even Devils! Pain won’t stop you and
the art of Combat comes to you as natural as breathing. Ancient Masters will look like amateurs in
front of you. Your Ki is so powerful it could manifest in Lightning surging through your body and your
Aura is strong enough to be seen radiating of your body. Your Soul is so tenacious you could even
survive attacks meant to directly destroy it. Now go and claim your title!"
136,400,Muscle Power!,Street Fighter,Refinement," Strongest! Mightiest! The hero of the ring! Your muscles carry you to victory
after victory, helping you attain glory for yourself and for those you fight for! Flex for the crowd
while you warm up, that itself might as well be practice.
 Purchasing this perk gives you great muscle definition as well as a whole lot of optional bulk.
Those muscles aren't just for show though, you're ridiculously strong now thanks to a prodigious
exercise schedule. You're even a bit tougher due to the density of those rippling muscles.
 More importantly however, you've acquired a potent defensive measure that's as flashy as it is
useful. You're able to take and endure powerful attacks in dramatic fashion while minimizing
damage to an absurd degree as long as you flex and brace for impact.
 Your body becomes so hard that mundane weaponry swung hard enough would break over your
biceps. Not only attacks, you could even fall from great heights and land perfectly fine if you flexed
at the right time. Show them your power!
Allows you to take and endure powerful attacks in dramatic fashion while minimizing damage to an
absurd degree as long as you brace for impact. In addition, grants considerable strength and
toughness."

Allow one to, thanks to appreciation and respect given towards food, store nutrients from them inside your own body in unseen concentration. It provides the benefit of gaining weight, without gaining fat and volume that comes with it. Food Immersion is the epitome of Food Honor, once mastered a person should be able to last without food for incredibly long periods and fight at their top potential. Allow one fight with maximum use of stored calories.
Requires Food Honor. If you roll this perk, you can obtain Food Honor for 200cp."
138,400,Autophagy,Toriko,Refinement,"Autophagy occurs when living beings are starved and need energy, so their cells consume other less vital parts of their body. With that perk, jumpers are able to enter that state, in order to regain full stamina for five minutes. After that, they need to eat something in twelve hours or they will be cripled. "
139,400,Bringing Nightmare,Toriko,Refinement,"Midora almost single handedly “killed” Gourmet Age, thanks to a tragic past made him believe that the world did not deserve Froese's charity and kindness. Now You too can have motivation to fuel through centuries in order to realize it. Jumpers resolve also gain unbending and steely quality, that with time and practice could be refined even further."
140,400,Sagitarius’ Last Stand ,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Refinement,"Are you letting them down ? Leaving the weaker behind you to their demise ? Not as long as you breath ! During a climatic battle against foes equal or stronger than you, when the stakes are too high, you can go on where many would have backed away, given up or died, ignoring pain and injuries as long as your soul shines and your cosmo burns. This doesn’t help you once it is over, and you may very well die for good once you beat him, but unless he literally pulverizes you, you won’t go down first.

141,400,Mephistopheles’ Plotting,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Refinement,"Patience, planification, psychology… you have a mind able to plot and arrange the unfolding of the whole Holy War in detail to your liking, even with time travelers or reality warper Gods thrown into the equation, so harmoniously it is a theater script to you. Knowing and planning is however all this perk helps you to, and for a reference, the above example required 20 years of careful manipulation of both factions for it to happen, neither was the plan ready in a day. "
142,400,Alone and Strong,Saint Seiya Omega,Refinement,"As a Palasite, you understand that your comrades are not allies but rather
stepping stones on your path to ascension. The cutthroat nature of Palasite
hierarchy demands self-sufficiency in battle, especially when facing the possibility
of betrayal or backstabbing from fellow Palasites. You have honed your skills to
excel in solo combat, capable of swiftly defeating opponents of equal strength in
mere moments in one-on-one duels. Moreover, you have developed a sixth
sense, intuitively sensing when someone intends to betray or deceive you,
allowing you to preemptively defend yourself against such treachery."
143,400,"Ran Raw, Running Red",Saint Seiya Episode G,Refinement,"Muscles torn, bones splintered, eyes going hazy and yet your burning will has only gotten brighter. No matter how grievously you’ve been injured or even if you’ve had parts taken out entirely, you’re still able to fight at your very best until you drop unconscious entirely. Injuries and fatigue no longer detract from your performance quality, in a fight or outside of it, though you will still take that damage and exhaustion. If it becomes too much, you may just fall into a coma or die on the spot, though even then your body won’t fall onto the ground if it was still standing. You’ll still be aware of how tired and hurt you are, you just won’t be held back by it."
144,400,Huge Will,Saint Seiya Episode G,Refinement,"You’ve gained an impressive, some might even say large, willpower beyond what most can imagine. There is little to no form of stress, pressure, or control that can break you or force you to act in a way you disagree with. Even when they are about to die, a true god would never bend the knee to any who did not genuinely wish to declare loyalty to. Even if one of the primordial gods descended before you and tried to take over your mind, your sheer, gigantic will would rebuff his attempts."
145,400,Crystal Mind,Feng Shen Ji,Refinement,"You gain a mind with perfect memory, being able to remember a promise or slight decades ago with perfect clarity and limitless space for many more memories to come. You also find that your mind cannot be viewed, tampered, altered, or controlled by outside forces (basically making you immune to illusions)."
146,400,Crystal Body,Feng Shen Ji,Refinement,"Your new body is now durable enough to be immune to all attacks that are not enhanced by a supernatural power. Also your body is immune to being forcefully changed, cloned, tampered or controlled, assimilated, or manipulated against your will (bio-kinetic abilities, viruses, and parasites are unable to find purchase upon you).
"
147,400,Crystal Soul,Feng Shen Ji,Refinement,"Your Soul/Life Force, Transcendent Vigor, or Smelting Aura cannot be stolen or siphoned for any reason. This protection extends to your other powers and energy pools you may possess while making sure your other powers cannot be stolen, copied, controlled, or manipulated against your will (you are a unique individual and will not accept any substitutes).
"
148,400,Huge,Fist Of The North Star,Refinement,"For some reason your body is naturally bigger than everyone else. It could be fat,
muscle, or you simply have a gigantic frame. Whatever the case is you now stand at between seven
and twenty feet tall with strength over twice what your monstrous size suggests."
149,400,Willpower,Fist Of The North Star,Refinement,"You are the heir to a long, proud lineage of warriors and have gone through
grueling training to reach this point. You managed to get this far, overcoming any hardships life threw
at you because you have an indomitable will. Your will can let you withstand any pain or push on in
the face of certain death. You don't need a reason to do something besides your own desires, but such a
will can drive you even in the most hopeless of situations and only grows stronger if you have someone
to fight for. If there is someone you love at stake, you can bring yourself to go through with options
you would never consider, even to the bitter end if it means their happiness. You can even get up after
death to keep fighting for a brief time if you just need a little longer, but don't think you can cheat death
with this."
150,400,Adaptability,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Refinement,"Under strenuous circumstances, your
body will temporarily adapt to alleviate any damages you might
receive. Someone blew fire in your face? Your skin will become
resistant to fire. Someone shove you under the sea and let you
soak there for three hours? Your body will use less oxygen,
enough so that you can live.
This will not make you immune to anything, it will just provide a
boost big enough to guarantee there are no irreversible
damages. A strong enough attack directed at you can still kill."
151,400,Body Enhancement Surgery,Reincarnator,Refinement,"By undergoing a surgery your protein-based
muscle is replaced with liquid-metal-based muscle, the surgery has the option of
increasing one's height and muscle appearance, it provides the user powerful

strength increase with a minimum of three times and limitless stamina but this is all
secondary, the primary purpose of the surgery is the regeneration boost that allows
one to heal even fatal injuries, just as long as the person is still alive. The silver liquid
that runs around one's body allows one to regenerate at a rate tens of times faster
than normal. The silver liquid metal can reattach missing limbs and even knit up a
person's lower half if it is cut off - as long as the person can pull himself together
quickly enough."
152,400,Mana Pool Surgery,Reincarnator,Refinement,"This surgery creates and places an organ called
<Mana Pool> into the body of a person which gives the person an amount of mana
""as large as the oceans"", It allows the person to use mana ""non-stop like monsters
for days"", and increase the original mana capacity by a three times, this <Mana
Pool> organ can also be used to merge all types of energy that the jumper has
access off into one singular energy that has all the positives and and devoid of the
negatives,"
153,400,A Sixth Fifth Sense,Demon Slayer,Refinement,"The Corps seems to attract individuals with unusually strong senses; whether it be a sense of smell strong enough to track objects for miles, hearing that can listen to thoughts or distinguish mortal from Demon by differing body rhythms, or touch that can detect a person's gaze through nothing but air vibrations. You have a similarly strengthened sense of (choose one) hearing, smell, sight, taste, or touch, allowing you to predict your opponent's attacks, distinguish between Demons and humans, and intuit the intentions of those around you. Your choice of sense comes with an additional ability, like Tanjiro's ""opening threads"" or Zenitsu's thought-hearing."
154,400,"Sleep Well, Child",Demon Slayer,Refinement,"In a truly extraordinary turn, your mind is now so strong that your body has to obey. Firstly, you can ""sleep off"" injuries, exhaustion, or even the need for sustenance, by going into a coma-like state; a day's calories can be ignored with a full 8 hours rest, while otherwise mortal wounds simply need a few weeks' of being fully out of it to heal. However, this is not the limit of your power - nay, you could say it is the source, in a way. In combat, you have a somewhat sluggish form of regeneration, like other demons, but yours is stronger, in that you grow a little tougher with each blow, a little stronger with each recovery. This is a steadier, if admittedly slower, form of power increase than most demons have, but it'll get the job done."
155,400,Talent and Muscles,Demon Slayer,Refinement,"Much like a certain Hashira you have a special constitution, your muscles being around eight times more dense than normal, giving you a significant increase in both strength and endurance without looking any different. Not only this, but you have a talent for breathing and fighting techniques, able to learn and train up about 5 times faster than you normally would.
"
156,400,Demonic Hero: Wild Beast,Avesta of Black and White,Refinement,"There is something inside you. A powerful idea that shapes you entirely, and gives you an endless willpower that just seems to grow in intensity each minute. Something that lets you push through any pain, injury and setback, just to keep walking towards it. Only the twisted Magsarion could compare when it comes to the strength of your will.

Perhaps your devotion is not set on the same murderous rage and killing intent that seems to stream from the Jet-Black Knight’s mind, maybe leaning towards a more noble purpose. But it is just as dense and powerful. Your presence is so strong that even those who are vastly more powerful than you cannot help but to feel fear at the sound of your laugh, your mere presence and gaze making others tremble from the sheer pressure of your will. And even those who try to dry your emotions or peer into your mind find themselves instead drowned on your bottomless emotions, eventually being erased by the ever-growing flow of emotions.

To many, you may seem a walking vortex of emotions rather than a man. Yet you may find that imperishable willpower of yours is quite a powerful asset in a world like this."
157,400,Potential Unleashed ,Dragon Ball Super,Refinement,"A mystic power attained only through a strange ritual administered by the former Supreme Kai of Universe 7, the potential unleashed state is a powerful form that forces out all your latent potential and then brings out even more power you didn’t know you had. Manifesting as a white aura around your body, it can even be easily utilised with other transformations without putting any further stress on your body. The power the form grants normally would be somewhere between the Super Saiyan 2 and 3 states but with mastery, as you have, the Potential Unleashed state has grown to enhance you with equivalent power to a Super Saiyan God transformation."
158,400,Paladin,Campione,Refinement,"The exact rank of paladin hasn’t been reached by anyone in a good while, people like Ena Seishuuin or Erica Blandelli are close, but not quite there. Saint Raffaello being perhaps the last one. It not only requires the leadership, tactical mind, magical prowess and excellent swordsmanship required for Great Knights, but also needs to go a step beyond that. Paladins are those with the power to go toe to toe with a Heretic God or Campione, even if a win isn’t really sure. That was until you came along, you now hold the title of Paladin within the magical community, as well as everything that entails. If this is enough for you to actually win against a Heretic God or Campione is up to the air, but this ensures you will be a good fight at the very least."
159,400,Natural Gathering,Trinity Wonder,Refinement,"This is the same ability that was of great use for Wujin. With it there is no need to manually gather energy. Just by living your body can automatically take in any available energy around it to restore itself. The rate of recovery is only limited to how much is available to you. Just holding some form of mana or ki crystal would allow you to near-instantly drain it of power. In an area rich in energy, it will be like you can never run out. Battles of attrition are often meaningless against you. However since you no longer need to consciously think about it, it would be easy for you to not notice if you end up somewhere with little energy available, leading you to wasting energy when you need it most."
160,400,Kurotsuchi Work,Bleach,Refinement,"Sometimes people are just born for a certain role. Some live for the stage, others were born to sing
and some were made to be on the operating table. When it comes to being a subject of science, you’d be eagerly desired by men like Urahara and Mayuri. Your body, and thus spirit, are quite
bizarrely accepting when it comes to experimentation and augmentation. Even very unlikely
surgeries or modifications now have an extreme chance of success, slotting into your spirit like they
were naturally meant to be there.
It does help that your spirit stores a outright strange amount of material inside, your body handling
augmentations that should appear bulky and over-sized without actually changing. Provided they are
inserted through careful surgery, you can even safely contain extremely harmful substances without
personal danger. Fill your body with toxic chemical cocktails, at no danger to yourself, but easily spat
out at any enemy that gets’ too close. "
161,400,Age Bringing Glory,Bleach,Refinement,"Age is a strange thing to the Shinigami. While the general rule is that the more powerful one is, the
slower one ages, it can often move at different rates for unique individuals. Two captains of similar
age may look entirely different, one a beautiful woman in her middle years and the other a wrinkled
old man, despite the old man being by far the more powerful. But unlike mortal beings, the minds
and bodies of the Shinigami rarely become frail. However old you may become, you appear to retain
the full capabilities of your youthful prime. An aging elder’s body still bulges with muscular power
and a thousand year old doctor’s mind remains as sharp as ever. The Reiatsu flows out strongly and indeed, there are some ways in which this age only makes you
more deadly. The passing of years will slowly, independent of your actual training or learning, reveal
to you secrets and developments to your skillset. The idle consideration given to one’s powers or
skills happens to uncover new ways to use old tricks, a method to slightly improve your control over
a fire-based release or give a flash of inspiration to solve a long mulled over problem. These
improvements come slowly but steadily, mainly to the things that you focus on in life. A legendary
Kido Master would naturally find his spells and casting of spells to improve as he grew older."
162,400,Chad,Bleach,Refinement,"Metal tearing! Girder blocking! Hollow destroying! What awaits your eyes, ladies and gentleman, is
nothing less than a Chad of humanity. A man whose muscles ripple with unearthly power, who has
the hide of an ironclad rhinoceros and the stamina of thirty men! Even before you gained spiritual
awareness, you were a monster among men. Ordinary hollows were only a threat because you
couldn’t see them, hold them down long enough and your thunderous blows could crack their masks
open. As you gained power, these traits remained, your strength and stamina and sheer toughness
growing at a rate that surpassed what was reasonable. Against a spiritual equal, you would be the
clear superior in these physical attributes, enough to make a battle man to man a daunting prospect. Not even mentioning the inherent intimidation that your height and girth confers. "
163,400,All Natural ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Refinement,"Some people are just born naturally gifted, their genetics putting them at a distinct physical advantage over others. With the right training, these people may go on to become record-breaking athletes, renowned across the world for their feats. And then there’s people like Itadori and you, who can exceed these limits without really trying, or perhaps even being aware of how unnaturally strong they are.

Even without the use of any cursed energy or heavenly restrictions, your physical abilities are a fair bit beyond the human limit. Through natural talent alone, you’re capable of such as feats as running 50 metres in just three seconds and throwing a shotput over 30 metres, both of which exceed the world records for such areas by an impressive margin, and you can likely go much further with actual training. This impressive physicality even helps with the use of jujutsu. When using cursed energy to enhance your body’s physical attributes, you get much greater results than normal, allowing you to hit harder, move faster, and shrug off more damage than others for the same expenditure of energy."
164,400,Synchronizer ,Tsukihime,Refinement,"I’d be careful about who you shared this ability with,friend. Your body has a unique quality - bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, sweat, and...other things have healing properties. Someone ingesting or making contact with it will quickly find their wounds healed, both physical and mental - it could bring someone reduced to maddening,gibbering insanity back into clarity so long as the source of said madness didn’t return.Unusually for this ability, it works both ways - your body will quickly heal wounds and restore itself upon being damaged - not enough to grow fresh limbs back or reverse death, but cuts vanish in minutes and vital organs are brought back to full functionality after a few days of rest.Your mind likewise repairs itself, madness and mental trauma slowly fading away as clarity is restored, able to lift you from catatonia back into almost perfect mental health after a peaceful day.
"
165,400,Awakened Predator ,Kara no Kyokai,Refinement,"Ah, more direct than most, are you? All this talk of predators and prey awoke an ancient lineage in you, a calling back to the days when we all had to crush and kill with our bare hands. When humans and beasts were no different. It might have been a miraculous success of the bloodchip drug or the result of an awakened origin, but you’ve become rather like Lio Shirazumi. Your body is powerful now, able to leap several storeys and tear through stone walls or crush human skulls with ease. Your senses have quickly come to match some of the best in the animal kingdom and the sharp fangs and claws that appear when you grow hostile slice flesh like it was just water. These traits slowly increase as time goes on and you hunt more, perhaps even new abilities sourced from predator animals appearing on you. 

Unlike Lio, you can halt and start the progress of this when you desire. Useful given it has an effect on your mind. Much more limited than the Shirazumi beast suffers but you still find that the more monstrous you become, the more your mindset begins to reflect that of a predator. Sheer force of will can restrain your urges to devour and kill, with magecraft perhaps holding keys to treat this mental affliction. Should you give into the power, you’ll soon be more than a match for many of the denizens of this city.
"
166,400,Regeneration,The God of High School Jump,Refinement,"Your body is capable of healing itself on a massive scale by utilising your life energy and doing so automatically. Whilst you now possess a quite significant healing factor even with expending your energy, enough to heal most cuts or bruises in a minute or two, when you actually spend energy this becomes far faster. You’ll be able to restore destroyed organs or severed limbs in just a few seconds and as you grow in overall power, the extent that you’re able to heal from will grow as well. Maybe someday soon you won’t need more than a head or a hand left to survive."
167,400,This is What I Want,The God of High School Jump,Refinement,"In the past, you experience a crisis of identity, of not knowing what your place or role in the world was and finding yourself unsure of who you were. But you survived that experience and came out with the knowledge of who and what you really are. You are always aware of who and what you are as a person, what your essence of character is, and unnatural changes that are forced on you cease to be so. It is not possible to change who you are, through magic or torture or drugs or any other methods, without your own consent. Indeed, you can even stop yourself from changing over time due to natural causes, such as retaining the fiery ambition you have as a youth or preventing yourself from becoming jaded over time. You are always aware of the ways you are naturally changing as a person and can stop all or some of these if you so desire."
168,400,A Most Divine Constitution,The God of High School Jump,Refinement,"A divine being is rarely one who falls to physical infirmities or the meagre wounds mortals are capable of producing. Even amongst Gods, your sheer endurance is remarkable. While most Gods would resist any mortal disease or poison, you are able to shrug off even the strongest of supernatural poisons or disease. And when it comes to being killed, it’s a trial and a half to actually make you stay down. You do not truly require any of the organs that frail humans rely so much on. Instead, so long as your body is at half there, you will survive and fight onwards. Even being reduced to a smoking, blackened skeleton from the waist up would not slow you down for a second."
169,400,Size Boost,The God of High School Jump,Refinement,"The Divine power within you has swelled your size to magnificent proportions. You tower over mere mortals, measuring a hundred meters in height. This great increase in size has given you the matching physical might of your new form. If you so wished, you could also reduce your size to a more manageable extent at your own will or only enlarge a specific part of your body. As your power grows, so too will the maximum size you may take. Eventually you might surpass even the Earth itself in your immensity."
170,400,The Undefeatable,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Refinement,"Is it the sheer perseverance of man or the subtle blessing of the Lord? Few had a death as drawn out as Rasputin but not out of spite but out of necessity. 4 or 5 lethal bullets, poison laced meals, being dumped into freezing water, that is what it took to silence the man. You too share his sheer persistence. Most if not all poisons barely inconvenience you thanks to your newfound immunity, and even if hurt in most vital areas you simply keep going. Even if you should have died from a wound, you will still cling to life, requiring extraneous time suffering the injury or truly over the top punishment than you should be able to endure to truly silence you."
171,400,Knowledge of the Sowa,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Refinement,"The layman is as far from comprehending your movements as our world is from the sun. Achieving
harmony with your blade has pushed it beyond the boundaries of what the human mind can easily
understand, leaving opponents unable to read your attacks or intent when fighting with a sword. Every attack is unforeseen, a surprise manoeuvre not encountered by you before no matter the
experience they have with you. Enemies must rely on raw reactions, skill and instinct to fight you as
understanding the combat techniques you use remains impossible. With normal attacks, it is
possible for someone to actively keep in their mind what your style is and consciously counter it but
this prevents them relying on instinct. To any special techniques you possess, they cannot even do
this and each one will be completely unexpected. These effects can be used even with weapons
other than the sword.

This harmony you have reached has also given you a heart that could be described as a perfectly still
pool of clear water. Your focus in battle is legendary, unwavering in the face of fear and able to
patiently wait in a ready stance for days on end. Even magical interference on your mind slides off, unable to taint the clear water."
172,400,Fifth Heavenly Hunter,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Refinement,"The greatest of all demon hunters are the ones with demon blood in their own veins. Even the
famous Minamoto no Yorimitsu and her four heavenly kings bear that taint. Through a personal
journey or being part of such a legendary group, you’ve become worthy of standing at the peak of all
hunters in this land. Your physical abilities may not match the most terrible of demons outright, though splitting a castle with an axe is well within your reach, but your combat abilities extend much
further. You are broadly skilled with many weapons and martial arts, enough to reach an expert level
in most, and are particularly talented at fighting those more powerful than yourself. Whereas a
master swordsman may outmatch you with their wits, you are able to fight in a way to negate the
advantages of demons tens of times your strength or speed. Knowledge of holy rituals and a lifetime
of slaughtering mysterious beasts has made you highly resistant to magic and able to deal much
more damage to beings of great mystery than normal.

Your demon blood heritage is fully turned to your benefit, making it much easier for you to deceive
and trick demons and Oni. Fooling them into treating you as an honoured guest, even when you are
a famous hunter of their kind, isn’t an impossible task. Lastly, as with the many demon hunter clans
to arise in later times, you are able to pass down your techniques and unique abilities to the rest of
your family. Your descendants are able to much more easily learn what you have learned, as well as
being able to unlock special powers that would normally have a very low rate of inheritance. Unlike
some clans, they also share any self control you have over your Oni nature, preventing them from
falling to madness."
173,400,Battlefield Terror,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Refinement,"Enough about love and beauty. A paladin may be a stunning star of the court but he is also a great
warrior in the king’s service. No longer are you merely an expert or proficient on the battlefield, now
you are a master seen once a century. Your sword strokes are often compared to an artform by
those lucky enough to survive seeing them and many men whisper that you must have magical
powers to command the horse to move in the supernatural ways you can, spurring them to move
faster than the eye can see with a nudge. Your body is through natural means able to contend with a
Saint that relies on holy power and should you find yourself in a formal duel against one opponent, your skills and abilities greatly heighten in threat level. But no hero can win forever and thus your
final defence is one of spite towards any that try and take from you. Any enemy of yours that is able
to steal a personal ability or item from you directly will find that not only do they gain little to no use
out of it, it will often backfire on them catastrophically. Whether it be your legendary sword
breaking in their hands or even turning against them, your stolen magic tearing them apart from
within or just your horse preferring death to ever obeying your foes."
174,400,Unleashed Will,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Refinement,"Yours is a mind that cannot ever be contained and a body that can never be imprisoned. A spirit that
can never be chained and a heart that will always be free. You possess a will like a wall of diamond, unbreakable and ever-lasting. Your mind, while not necessarily more educated than before, races
ahead and beyond almost any other. You possess Super High Speed Thought naturally, letting you
think at hundreds of times the pace of any other being when desired to make plans on the fly even
when in a fight. This thought can, through significant stress on your body, even briefly cross over to
the actions of your body, letting you move so fast that it briefly appears that time is stopped for you. The desire for freedom has a final benefit, a heart’s desire that allows you a conceptual advantage in
escaping any prison or maze. Even one made from warped space and bent time is not inescapable to
you, not with enough time, as your advantages render any impossible escape into something
possible."
175,400,"
The Strongest Demon King",Gourmet Of Another World,Refinement,"The strongest demon king is a title bestowed upon the leader of the Ruin Prison Demon Kings. There are two main reasons for this. First is his overwhelming combat power. Only beings significantly more powerful than him such as Netherking and Lord Dog are capable of dealing with him. Second is the purity of his bloodline which allowed him to stand out amongst his tribe. You share these qualities, in simple terms you hit much harder and the purity of your bloodline is raised to the peak. The effects regarding your bloodline will extend to any that you possess. 
"
176,400,The Dragon Advances,Cradle,Refinement,"Cultivation requires a lot of things beyond raw resources.
Patience, willpower, spiritual determination, many other words for similar things. You've got it in
spades. Where most others would give up and attempt something easier, you'll bash your head
straight into the brick wall until you slam right through the barriers holding you back. Long nights
studying won't wear you down like they should, if anything they almost energize you. The same
can be said of training sessions of any other kind, especially if you're showing visible progress."
177,400,The Embarrassing Truths,Cradle,Refinement,"The higher tiers of advancement within Cradle's magics
require some deep introspection, and oftentimes those turn out to be some embarrassing
answers to seemingly simple questions. ""Why do I practice the sacred arts?"" leads to things like
""So I’m not worthless"" and other sappy thoughts. Some might find this sort of introspection to be
a roadblock to growing in strength. Not you. You never have to shy away from your true self
ever again. In later Jumps, you'll instantly know things like your True Name, your Soul's Nature,
your own reasonings behind everything you do. Here, you'll instantly know the answers to the
questions asked of the Lord Class to advance, and even the later tiers such as Sage and Herald
are less difficult."
178,400,Tenacious Lifeforce,Dragon Ball,Refinement,"Some beings within this world have truly horrifying amounts of lifeforce. Beings such as
Cell, Majin Buu, and Janemba capable of surviving what would be beyond lethal injuries
for others. Luckily, you are one of these individuals as well. You are capable of surviving
and retaining your consciousness even if you have been chopped into a hundred
pieces. The only way to truly kill you is to utterly destroy every trace of your being. This
property also grants you an unparalleled regenerative factor allowing you to restore your
entire body in less than a second from a single cell.
The only ways for someone to defeat you are through overwhelming power or through
mysterious arts like sealing."
179,400,Silkpants,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Refinement,"The Silkpants lifestyle is regarded by most to just be a fancy way to say ‘spoiled rich’. And that’s
mostly right, yes. Yet, it would be inaccurate to say there’s no use in such a thing. You have a
talent for it now, a taste and skill at everything that comprises the ‘party boy/girl’ lifestyle.
You have the ability to just ‘let go’, to forget about the worries and the grind of the cultivation
rat race, and while away your days partying and just having fun. You know your alcohol and
your fashions, and your mind-altering drugs if you’re the kind to use them. And you find that
doing so actually helps you. Stress and tension melts away, and your comprehension soars as
your mind explores new horizons.
More than just being able and good at the Silkpants lifestyle, perhaps your biggest talent is the
ability you have to tempt others into it. No matter how fastidious or devoted they might

normally be, all you need is the slightest chink in their armor, the slightest hint of a vice, and
you know how to draw upon it and ensnare them into this same lifestyle. It wouldn’t be easy,
but you could turn a millennium old, utterly devoted ascetic into a drunken whoremonger in a
matter of weeks, if not days.
You could use these skills, with a lot of time and effort to design a whole cultivation style
around hedonism and teach it to others, or you could use them to just ruin promising geniuses
so that you shine brighter. Either way, it should be a lot of fun, yeah?"
180,400,I WILL Live Forever,A Will Eternal,Refinement,"A cultivate needs something to chase after. A Dao that guides them along their path of
cultivation. For some this could be the constant wish for more power, for them to stand at the
very top of the pyramid. For others this could be the endless chase for eternal life. Whatever
it is, as long as they follow it, they will never stop, never deter from their path. Their
determination is unshakable. A determination that you share too. Provided you have your
own Dao to follow, your determination will be as solid as the very earth beneath you. Even
with eyes bloodshot and a body on the brink of collapse, you will just keep persevering."
181,400,Blood-Drinking Palm,One finger Death Punch,Refinement,"One Finger Death Punch is not just a killing art, but also a healing one. After defeating enough
opponents, the student will find their wounds sealing and injuries salving themselves with the
exertion of the practitioner."
182,400,Eidolon of the Sun,Generic Exalted,Refinement,"There is one simple truth about the Exaltations. They are weapons,
and the beings they attach themselves to are warriors. Whether you be a poet, a bureaucrat, a
sailor, a merchant, or even a humble farmer you are first and foremost a weapon to be wielded,
tested, and one day broken. It is through these constant trials, these different lives, that the
power of the exaltation is made manifest, and it is this power that once brought down the
masters of Creation itself.
When you are fighting, you fight harder. Faster. Longer. When you are playing you play harder.
Faster. Longer. When you are working you work harder. Faster. Longer. You live a more full life,
for you burn brighter than any others, a reminder that even if the sun has sunk below the
horizon that the day is not yet gone. In any endeavor you throw yourself into you will be
noticeably superior than you otherwise would be, as you commit the fullness of yourself to your
task. Even if you should be surrounded and alone, half dead and stumbling, they will pay for
every single step that they take, and every last drop of blood that they spill. You may fall, o
Chosen of the Sun, but you will not fall easily.
In effect you embody everything that is good within the Solar. Compassion, Valor, Temperance,
and Conviction. So long as you act within these bounds you will go far above and beyond what
any else might manage, so long as you dedicate yourself fully."
183,400,Talons Reach Through Prison Bars,Abyssals Exalted,Refinement,"Once banished from Creation, the Princess Magnificent was punished by her Neverborn
master. She was not stripped of her power, nor dispatched to Oblivion, nor damned to suffer
unspeakable agonies for an age. Instead, He Who Holds in Thrall bound her to serve the
First and Forsaken Lion, whom she has despised ever since. She is not permitted to enter
the Labyrinth at all without the First and Forsaken Lion’s accompaniment, nor can she enter
Stygia. She has not been seen in Creation for centuries and is practically forgotten there.

Yet, this has not stopped her from pursuing her own objective of freedom. She has been the
Lion’s prisoner for centuries, yet she still spits on any and every attempt of his to win her
loyalty, and constantly schemes to undo her superior and seize his assets for herself. She
has been forbidden from having Abyssal servants of her own, yet this did not stop her from
acquiring a monstrance and choosing a hidden servant either.
Like her, you will be able to undergo any torment and imprisonment without giving an inch in
your personal convictions. Should you hate your captor, you will hate them just as much or
more after a thousand years of imprisonment at their hands. And if there is even the
remotest chance of affecting things outside of your captivity, the remotest chance of gaining
your freedom... you will find a way to affect things outside, even if that way has to be through
recruiting new servants to serve as your eyes and do your bidding."
184,500,Old Fashioned Brawler - Boosted,UQ Holder,Refinement,"They said you couldn’t do it, survive on just your raw muscle power. You’ve proved everyone wrong for half a millennium now, and you’re not stopping any time soon. A stomp from you can cause an earthquake that can be felt hundreds of kilometers away, and all but the mightiest of spells break when you give them a good head butt. You’re even able to race around the world in just a few minutes. You’ve got a body that is nigh on perfection, in raw power and speed, and even just how god damn good you look. All that strength makes you look like you’ve been carved from solid steel. You’d give even the legendary Jack Rakan an equal match, provided he relied solely on his own natural power and didn’t use any magic."
185,500,Monster Of Adaptation,One Punch Man,Refinement,"Garou’s unique ability to surpass his limits in the heat of battle has become your own. Every time you push yourself to the edge, your body responds by growing stronger, faster, and more resilient. You don’t simply adapt—you evolve. Each fight leaves you more powerful than before, and there’s no limit to how far you can push yourself. Even when on the brink of defeat, your body adapts, allowing you to keep fighting at full strength or even beyond it. This ability to break past your own limits makes you an ever-growing threat that no one can truly prepare for."
186,500,The Street Fighter,Street Fighter,Refinement," While you would have started off as maybe the strongest person in your
hometown, maybe even your whole city, that's not enough for the world stage. You were good,
trained a lot, but no one would have called you a master of your style.
 Maybe you want to change that however, unable to wait and train to accomplish the ambitions
burning in your chest. If you're feeling impatient, then how about becoming the real deal now? Upon
purchase, you will go from being adept in your fighting to something others would call a master. The
Ryu of your martial art in simplistic terms.
 You know much more about the skills, techniques and nuances of your art and have had the
training drilled into your body, the knowledge punched into your brain. You are strong, and would
be able to compete on the world stage after this perk's purchase. You are still a long, long way from
matching the monsters of martial arts in this world though."
187,500,Griffin’s Pawns,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Refinement,"The Three Judges of the Underworld are generals of the 108 Specters for a good reason, and now you’d have one too. You are neither a one man army nor a twisted front figure, but an actual general. You have what it takes to handle an expeditionary force from top to bottom, calculating match-ups, loss, acceptable risks and whatever you need to crush the enemy, able to make the best of what you have thanks to your many centuries of experience in many Wars."
188,500,Post-Apocalyptic Savior,Fist Of The North Star,Refinement,"Within you rest a curious thing in this world, the hope for a better
tomorrow. You believe that there is no such thing as too far gone, that even the most ruined land or
damned soul can be saved. You may or may not be right, but either way you can inspire others to
improve themselves and the world around them in a positive way. Then they too will inspire others like
a plague of hope. Even amidst ruin you can inspire greatness, men and the world can rise again. This
is not the end and you will prove it."
189,500,The Tyrannical Emperor’s Divine Veins,Against The Gods,Refinement,"Suited for highly aggressive, driven people, this gift
bestows a body like that of the Primordial God of War on a mortal.
Simply through your boundless aggression and ego, you are able to grow in leaps and bounds on the
Profound Way. As soon as the veins are activated, an action that would take almost unmatched will
to fight, extreme injuries for months on end and a limitless will, you are instantly propelled into the
Tyrant realm, to be heralded by the world as an Overlord.
From there your growth is similarly huge, allowing you to skip entire realms, but requires
correspondingly more dire circumstances."
190,500,Nine Profound Exquisite Body,Against The Gods,Refinement,"Your body is utterly exquisite and unmatched. You have a ‘small
world’ inside you, which allows you to hold far more power within you than would otherwise be
possible.
Simply put, you can preserve your Profound Energy without needing to strain your Profound Veins,
allowing you to perform techniques and measures requiring any level of Profound Cultivation
without suffering the consequences anyone else would suffer in your place.
The inner world in you can hold any quantities of energy of any and all kinds, and you can channel
this energy without any damage to your body. But it doesn’t generate any energy by itself, requiring
you to save it up."
191,500,Heart of Snow Glazed Glass,Against The Gods,Refinement,"Your mind is extraordinary, allowing you to perfectly remember and
recall anything you have so much as seen or heard once, and your perception matches and
complements this perfectly. Not only are your natural senses massively boosted, you can also view
‘beyond the veil’, to see past even the greatest illusions and directly perceive and interact with the
‘laws’ of the world and see it as it really is, beyond what anyone else can.
This also gives you an extreme sensitivity to even the faintest concepts and skills, allowing you an
absolutely monstrous level of comprehension towards even the most complex ideas, codes or
patterns, allowing you to comprehend any and all techniques, whether or not you’re capable of
using them. Even techniques restricted to specific bloodlines or sects are open to you, although how
well you can use them depends on your other abilities.

Finally, you’re blessed by the heavens, meaning that you can instinctively sense danger in any
situation, and look into people’s hearts and see if they are good, evil or anywhere in between."
192,600,The Strength of the Weak ,Cradle V1,Refinement,"Once, you were weak, simply a small fish in a smaller pond. But now, after all your adventures, you have been made strong. You gain an objective sense of how strong you are and lose any lingering feelings of inadequacy or fear from any of your abilities. In addition, you can now project that strength outward, radiating an aura that forces others to understand and acknowledge how powerful you truly are."
193,600,Just Getting By,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Refinement,"In these days, it is so easy to fall into the pits of despair. With all the power being held by a fraction of a fraction of the population, everyone else serves them in some way. However, you will never fall into the pits of despair as they do. Your mental state, no matter how badly damaged, will always continue to repair itself, never going down."
194,600,I Choose King,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Refinement,"Many people hate themselves. They wallow in their failures, and they feel misery over how stuck they are. But there is a path, one that can lead them out. When you want to change, you will find that through some self-reflection and enlightenment, you can change into the person you want to be. Additionally, so long as you like what you currently are, you will remain that way."
195,600,Birth of the King,Toriko,Refinement,"Through generations your species fight, survive and thrive in the Gourmet World. That fact alone allowed you to unlock the potential to become a King. With each battle and consumed food, you'll come closer to the status and strength of the King. Upon reaching the status of King of your species, your physical stature will be enhanced to a level that borders the nature of a living god. Your species ability and properties also will be enhanced in a similar way, gaining supernatural quality during ascension to Kinghood. That event also allows you to develop additional abilities unique to just your person, making an already impressive example of your species, a mythical figure."
196,600,Devouring,Toriko,Refinement,"Limitations imposed by your body when it comes to eating, are simply gone. As long as food was hunted by them, users of this perk could devour objects many times of their size, even whole planets. It also provides a boost to its strength, in order for Monster Troll to perform that feat. Digestion of those objects is done in time as if one digested normal brunch.
"
197,600,Number One,Saint Seiya Omega,Refinement,"Congratulations, esteemed Palasite, for you have ascended to the pinnacle of
your class. Whether you are classified as third, second, or first class, you now
stand as the undisputed strongest among your peers. Your Cosmo power,
strength, speed, and ferocity have surged to unprecedented levels, surpassing
even the most formidable of your fellow Palasites by at least twofold. With this
newfound power coursing through your veins, you are a force to be reckoned
with on the battlefield, striking fear into the hearts of your enemies and
commanding the respect of your allies."
198,600,God of War,Saint Seiya Episode G,Refinement,"All those years of war aren’t for nothing. Even in the modern day, mankind still tells legends of your prowess in combat and the gods you once fought against bear the scars of your battles together. In terms of pure skill, you are the equal of the greatest fighters that have ever walked the Earth or any of the many realms within this universe. You can effortlessly measure the power of your foes and compare it to your own, noticing every strength and flaw and opening in any ally or enemy you observe in combat for just a few moments as well as how to take advantage of those openings to lethal effect. You make no mistakes in combat, always acting in a measured and frighteningly efficient degree, as if you had perfectly planned out every step and swing years in advance. Your raw skill applies to any form of combat you are able to do at this moment and will allow you to easily and quickly master any new forms you attempt to pick up later."
199,600,Ancients,Feng Shen Ji,Refinement,"If something ain't broke, don't fix it. This logic can apply to you now as you have become a primordial life-form resistant to the passages of time, no longer aging once you hit the prime of your life. You will also find that your skills and power no longer degrade or debilitate beyond their prime; whether by time, disuse, injuries, poison, disease, being drunk, or suppression as while as any other method to weaken you (your powers and strength will always operate at peak capacity no matter your state, even if you were on your deathbed). You will also find you have immunity to boredom, never lacking motivation or curiosity as time marches on. 
"
200,600,Primordial Power,Feng Shen Ji,Refinement,"Your ageless body also seems to slowly grow on its own as the years pass, 
marking every year as a new benchmark. At minimum this growth will yield a 
10% increase to all attributes (mental and physical), abilities, and even energy 
pools every year. Without degradation you also have achieved perfect control of 
your abilities. This gives a godly precision for all your abilities so that they 
will only ever affect intended targets of such powers. Conjure a sea of flames

201,600,Keldian Ability,Reincarnator,Refinement,"Very much like him, now you posses an unparalleled
intellect, being able to rationalize and understand any situation and complex things
at a glance, this won’t give you raw knowledge, but rather the ability to be a sponge
and learn at a much faster rate than others and assimilate it, being by itself a very
powerful skill to possess and like him be able to use thousands of skills at the same

202,600,Solo Numbering Skill 1 : <Immortal Soul>,Reincarnator,Refinement,"Immortal Soul turns the user's body
close to an immortal's. It allows one to fight like a ""Mad Immortal"" in the battlefield
with no worry about injuries or stamina due to the extreme regeneration granted by
the skill. It can regenerate new tissues and life force, mend broken pieces of one's
body, and even regenerate lost limbs. Immortal Soul raises one's soul and body to
the extreme. Its main power is survival and it utilizes every skill and everything one
has to survive. It can heal the soul with mana and can create a foundation for the
Skills of Annihilation <Zero Numberings> to grow."
203,600,Perfection of Heart,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Refinement,"The Dao Heart, a mysterious concept pertaining to one’s devotion to the Dao. Yours is an
impressive specimen, reaching what many would call “Perfect”. What does this mean? Any
attempts at illusions, manipulation, and unbalancing your psyche simply fail. You gain perfect
understanding of yourself, and an infinite Willpower to survive for quadrillions of years under
torture without even considering giving up. This is also failing to mention any effects this would
have on your heartforce, which is now far stronger than it should be. Even if you didn’t
specialize in it, with this you are now capable of forming a heartworld."
204,600,Demon Slayer Crest,Demon Slayer,Refinement,"""At the zenith of a Demon Slayer's power, in one of the most intense battles of their life, they may awaken a power not seen since the creator of the Breath of the Sun, the original Slayer fighting style: the Demon Slayer Crest, a scar-like marking on your face or neck which stylistically matches your fighting style. Simply possessing the mark puts your strength, agility, and endurance in line with the strongest of the Upper Moons--an increase upwards of twenty times (compatible with other boosts), making you one of the most formidable Slayers in the Corps bar none. Additionally, you can see beneath the skin to the blood flow, joints, and muscles of those around you, granting you the keenest of insight into their movements, and the world seems to slow down around you, allowing you to react to attacks the instant your opponent's body begins to follow through. Lastly, you can ignite your weapon with a blazing crimson aura. While not literal fire, this glow is an amazingly powerful tool against creatures with regenerative properties because it substantially slows their regeneration down; enemies which would regrow limbs in seconds take five times as long to repair damage done by such attacks. All aspects of this perk - the appearance of the mark, the increased physical abilities, the """"see-through world,"""" and the crimson blade - can be toggled individually. Also, some people might think that bearing the Demon Slayer Crest shortens your lifespan; this is false. Taking this Perk will not negatively affect your lifespan."""
205,600,Ignorant Queen: Murderous Immortal,Avesta of Black and White,Refinement,"You have gained an immortality that stands above even that of the Einherjar of the Golden Beast, one comparable to the Arch-Demon Frederica. While you don’t need to be a Man-Eating Demon for this, you enjoy an exceptional regeneration of the same tier. Destroying your body, chopping into a rain of blood, will do nothing. Even the most powerful of magics capable of easily destroying souls, Commandments specialized in killing and the Power of Ego of Arch- Demons fail to do anything when it comes to ending your life or permanently injuring you. Even getting erased into nothingness will have you reappear an instant later. Attacks hit, but no effect manages to take on you, as your regeneration is so fast that it may as well be instant, leaving only the small feeling of having hit something.

However, you would do well not to think of yourself as completely invincible, as this effect doesn’t shield your mind from effects not considered an attack, magic will still affect you just fine when it comes to just sealing you, and other abilities will still affect you for a time at least as long as they aren’t dealing any form of damage. And the actual Gods may still be able to bypass this effect, at least if you do not possess the same form of divinity as well.

Furthermore, this protection is based on your own your own conviction to stand against any kind of attack directed at you, so the moment you decide to dodge any kind of attack your immortality will be deactivated up until your next jump, or ten years, whichever comes sooner."
206,600,Immutable Nothingness: Void        ,Avesta of Black and White,Refinement,"The cycling nature of the World of Dualism has brought despair in many ways to those trapped in it. And nothing shakes more its inhabitants than the uncertainty of this ever-shifting world that seems to be trapped in an ever-spinning charade of a war, where nothing is certain but the perpetuation of a conflict that will never seem to reach a satisfactory conclusion. Thus, people seek refuge in things that they consider certain, like how the Ashavan chase after the image of a true hero that will save them, or how many Daeva pursue their own strength as their only certainty. Even those with the potential to assault the heavens and take the Divine Throne for themselves yearn for something that gives them true security, an ‘immutable’ goal.

You have rejected all these foolish notions. The Hero of the Ashavan? Nothing but an ever-shifting ideal on which people project their anxieties. The mighty warriors of the Daeva who devote their existence to chasing the throne of their strongest? If their strength was immutable, they wouldn’t need to prove anything. Greed? Beauty? or Love? All of them are nothing but trash that cannot stand even the simplest inspection, a house of cards waiting to fall.

Only you, who has realized the truth of how pathetically feeble all these ideas are, can be worthy of being called truly immutable. And your body now reflects that. What was once subjected to being changed by others, it is now something that can only be affected by your own actions, as if your flesh had been replaced by something sturdier than matter: an idea. Attacks capable of shattering galaxies, even the powers of the emerging gods, cannot affect you. They cannot even make you budge a bit. The only thing that can change your own body is you, any other actions that come from anything that isn’t yourself or your own body will simply fail to have any effect. Be warned however that the actual gods and those who are on their level of existence may still find ways to affect you.

As your immutable body is no longer bound by the changing laws of reality that move at the wills of Star Spirits and Gods, it also allows you to preform feats of unimpeded movement, such as walking and running through any medium, even air or the void, unrestrained, ignoring things such as gravity. his doesn’t give you any additional offensive strength by itself, but it’s not that you need to affect the changing universe to reaffirm your immutability."
207,600,Jaeger,Bleach,Refinement,"What happens when you take a Hollow utterly obsessed with evolution and bring him to the peak of
power? Sometimes you a rather special example of the race. You possess an active evolutionary trait
that allows you to adapt to threats even without the consuming of souls. Exposure to something and
survival of it will cause resistance to begin to build up. Surviving a deadly Quincy poison and
returning to a healthy state would likely leave you with a strong resistance to toxins of all kinds, not
just that one poison. The more specific it is, and more powerful the threat, the quicker this
adaptation will develop. Being cut or crushed is likely to only give very small gains even when
critically injured but exposure to unique Kido spells or strange drugs that the mad scientists keep
making would return a rapid resistance or outright immunity. You need to survive it first, a Hollow
has to prove it’s worthy to be the king of the pack, but you’ll only get harder to kill as you live longer. "
208,600,Flash Goddess,Bleach,Refinement,"It all comes down to speed, in the end. The first strike, the power in each hit, dodging everything the opponents try and taking on them all at once. If you don’t have speed, you’ll be lacking in all of them. But if there’s anything you can call your own, it’s that flashing speed. Compared to your peers, your speed, agility and reflexes are completely off the charts. Someone might be able to hurt you in a fight but they’ll barely catch a glimpse of you once you get moving. Dozens of skilled martial artists
can barely graze you as you dance gracefully through their ranks. You’ll leave quite a few bodies in
your wake too, given the ease with which you enhance your martial arts with that sheer speed. Your natural talent for quick movement and agility will see you continually increase it with ease, having a gift for any techniques relating to such things. It’s left you an expert in the enhanced
movement techniques of your race, such as Shunpo or Sonido, and even taught you some things that
probably shouldn’t be possible, like making solid afterimages to attack alongside you. If you could
reach the Reiryoku levels of a Captain, you can even claim equality with the Flash Goddess herself. "
209,600,Intellectual Titan,Bleach,Refinement,"With the right foundation, maybe there’s not as much need to specialise. Ever since you were born, you felt different from all the other kids. You understood things more easily, everyone felt slow in comparison. You only realised later that it was the signs of genius, the sort of intellect to match Aizen or Urahara. While this does not innately grant any knowledge or skill of it’s own, your now thoroughly incredible mind will make up for that in short order. Comprehension comes easily, even complicated concepts being easily understood in short order, and you see that it’s simple to innovate and improve on existing ideas. A new skill or discipline
progresses swiftly once you focus, able to rapidly progress to levels that would take ordinary souls
many years to reach. Spending the decades that most Shinigami or Quincy take to make their own
breakthroughs would see you reach the utter mastery of a field expressed by people like Kurotsuchi
or Urahara. Your mind is particularly well suited to breaking new ground where few have
approached before, discoveries and progress becoming far easier to reach if you are one of the
earliest to research a subject. The combination of Shinigami and Hollow may be taboo but just look
at what Kisuke and Aizen accomplished on their own."
210,600,Base Mixture,Bleach,Refinement,"At the end of the day, we’re all humans here. Shinigami, Hollows, Quincy, just about everyone has a
human as their basis regardless of what racial supremacy they might spout. Humanity is the base
foundation and maybe that’s why they’re so malleable, with such potential to be altered. More than
most, your being is open to modifications and change. Experiments or enhancements that have to
do with the mixing of the races have a much greater chance of success and a much lower chance of
any sort of complication. Hybridisation, often a fraught endeavour, seems almost natural to you. So much so that it might
happen entirely accidentally. A Plus spirit whose spirit chain begins to hollowify would be much
more likely to somehow absorb that hollowfication without losing their self, becoming a mixture of
both soul and hollow without the need of soul science or magic. Even impossible mixtures, like the
normally poisonous combination of Quincy and Hollow reiatsu, are possible. Your children will also share these traits, if desired and in part or full, allowing you to easily pass on
things that probably shouldn’t be passed on. How does a Shinigami child naturally develop a
Zanpakuto spirit, without ever touching an asauchi? He inherited it, clearly."
211,600,Maiden's Iron Will,Bleach,Refinement,"Your soul and your will become one and the same, in many of the most important ways. While
determination is known to somewhat reinforce a soul, that is largely by allowing the being to draw
on more than is safe or painless in their battle. Your conviction directly empowers your spiritual
abilities, from a Zanpakuto’s release or Fullbring’s power to Kido spells or spiritual techniques like
Shunpo. You can focus this into a single ability to receive the most advantage or spread it evenly
across many at once. Even the steady determination of an experienced soldier giving noticeable increases in power across
the board. True conviction could increase this to magnify your power several times over or, if
focused through a single ability, allow you to accomplish normally impossible feats. Your mind, your
very will, turns your spirit into both a nearly unstoppable force and a nearly unbreakable barrier, as
long as you can maintain that utter belief and force of will that what you are doing must be done. But for all the easy and immense power this might give, it comes with a flaw. As conviction raises your power, so too does the lack of willpower cause your spiritual strength to falter. While you can
temporarily give up both benefits for a short time to avoid this, the rapid fluctuations in battle can
cause imbalances in power if you do not keep yourself controlled. "
212,600,Something Special,Jujutsu Kaisen,Refinement,"Not all cursed spirits are made equal. This is already evident in the grading system placing them in categories according to their strength, but even in special grade there is a large variance in terms of abilities. While some are ‘merely’ strong enough to take on groups of powerful sorcerers and win, others are powerful enough that lesser special grades may well be little more than fodder. Similarly, even among those of equal power there are differences not just in cursed techniques, but the innate qualities their forms possess.

By taking this perk, one of your physical attributes has been increased to abnormal levels even without using any cursed energy to reinforce your body. If you picked strength, for instance, you’d be able punch someone hard enough to send them flying through several skyscrapers without even using your full strength. Pick durability, and you’d be able to withstand an onslaught from multiple grade 1 sorcerers attacking with more than enough force to shatter concrete with barely a scratch to show for it, and a blow from a special grade cursed tool that might obliterate a limb of one of your peers might only excise a chunk of flesh. Select speed, and you’d be able to fly through the air faster than the speed of sound, and even hit Mach 3 if using a cursed technique devoted to speed.

You may take this perk multiple times, with further purchases costing 300 CP each (undiscounted).

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
213,600,God of War,Jujutsu Kaisen,Refinement,"Humans, be they sorcerer or not, are all born with a certain level of cursed energy innate to their being – sorcerers just have a higher amount of the stuff, along with the ability to control it. There are rare cases, though, when would-be sorcerers are born with abnormally low levels of cursed energy, less even than an ordinary human, and in exchange are gifted with superhuman natural physical capabilities. Rarer yet is one born with no cursed energy at all, of which only two cases are known to have ever existed. The result of this is a monster capable of contending with even the strongest of sorcerers.

Now, you are the third such case – a being born without any cursed energy, with all of the benefits this comes with. The first, and most notably, are your physical abilities, which have far transcended the limits of any normal human. You’re strong enough to smash down buildings, shatter thick concrete walls, and casually throw cars around. The ground forms sizeable craters when you strike it, and all but the toughest of curses could be killed with a single blow should you land a clean hit on them with a cursed tool.

Your toughness is similarly impressive, able to take such hits without being injured too badly, and any injuries you do take short of missing limbs or organs can be healed relatively quickly. You could be crushed between two enormous hands of stone, large enough to fully envelop your body, and not only would you be able to overpower them, but break through them without much being harmed much at all. Even if you were slammed into the ground at speeds far faster than the speed of sound, rupturing your organs and leaving you unable to move, you’d be able to get up again after barely five minutes of recovery and keep fighting as if nothing happened.

You can move so fast that others have difficulty even perceiving your movements, able to cut down multiple highly-skilled sorcerers before they even have a chance to react to your presence. Combined with your equally impressive agility and reactions, you could catch bullets fired at point blank range, run across water, and bound off of walls and trees with effortless ease.

Your senses are likewise a lot sharper than they were before. You’re capable of spotting even the slightest of oddities in your foes’ movements, and can even perceive the air itself.Through this, you could determine the presence and actions of invisible creatures by how the air moves around them, and even pre-empt their movements to a degree. More than this, you can even see the scattered surfaces in the air created by subtle differences in temperature and density, and somehow use them to manoeuvre in mid-air, swinging and leaping through the skies in ways no other could predict. This, combined with your speed and agility, affords you such mobility that even a cursed spirit moving at Mach 3 would be completely unable to keep up with you.

In addition to the above, having no cursed energy has benefits of its own – specifically, that any ability that targets cursed energy has no effect on you. Barriers, for instance, can only recognise and prevent the entrance or exit of beings with cursed energy – while any other sorcerer might be completely blocked by one, you could walk straight through it as if it wasn’t there. Similarly, effects that detect others based on their cursed energy wouldn’t even register you, and even the guaranteed-hit effects of Domains would be unable to target you. This also applies to any other supernatural energies you might possess.

The main downside of having no cursed energy, of course, is just that: you don’t have any cursed energy. As such, not only are you completely unable to use any sort of cursed technique, but you’re also unable to harm cursed spirits – you’ll need a cursed tool or other object imbued with cursed energy to do that. However, given that those with this ability are capable of fighting an entire clan of sorcerers at once and emerging as the sole survivor, or taking on special grade cursed spirits and defeating them single-handedly so long as they’re armed with a decent cursed tool, the benefits are well worth such small drawbacks."
214,600,War Trophies,The God of High School Jump,Refinement,"You’ve been blessed with a constitution unique amongst the Three Realms, save for a certain being. When you experience and survive a supernatural attack or strange substance of some sort, such as a virulent poison or powerful acid, you will absorb part of that hostile attack into your body, forming into a mark or tattoo of some size and form. This grants you a great resistance to whatever the attack was as well as a lesser resistant to other attacks of a similar type. Surviving the bite of a mythical snake monster would make you more resistant to poison and highly resistant to the same bite from that mythical snake. Surviving the same attack multiple times will increase this resilience as well as making the representing tattoo larger or more intricate. Eventually you will have an entire tapestry denoting the many battles you have survived that covers your form.

Boosted: Got not time to build up a resistance, not when you're diving headfirst into the blades of the enemy. You don't need to anymore at least. As long as you can survive a supernatural attack or strange substance, you'll be immune to it from that point onwards. It's quite specific, being attacked with life energy in the form of an elemental fire blast will make you immune to fire attacks powered by life energy, not all fire or life energy attacks. Do note that the tattoos you get from these immunities are particularly impressive ones.

You don’t have any limit and your potential is infinite, letting you grow stronger and
evolve without the worry of having a roof to your growth. You’re also very compatible
with any form of power boost, being able to become more powerful by absorbing
energy and training without needing to worry about being incompatible with some
form of power. This lets you become stronger with this, but doesn’t nullify their side

some lucky Ōtsutsuki, but you’re specially gifted with this kind of spiritual resilience.

When it comes to skill, few among the Church members can claim to be your equal, being among the greatest Executors. You have over a decade worth of experience killing Magi and your physical capabilities are so enhanced you could dodge bullets and jump 10 meters in height instantly. It is to a point where you could even kill a Servant like the Omnipotent Genius Da Vinci under the right conditions.

Your faith can even have mystical effects in the form of Spiritual Healing, allowing you to cure the physical and mental states of others and even illnesses, though not your own. Even more malevolent spirits are not safe from your faith, as you also mastered the Baptism Rite, a simple ritual that is nonetheless incredible effective against spirits, attacking them directly and purifying them."
218,600,Andreias Amarantos,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Refinement,"Having been bathed in holy flames blessed by the Gods of Olympus when you were younger, you
share a similar blessing as Achilles. Your body has become invincible, at least in regards to those that
lack the divine. Any attack, no matter the power or nature, will fail to harm your body should it not
be delivered by a divine weapon or a divine being, even magic or powerful conceptual weapons. To
truly pass this defense, the divinity must be equal to that of at least a demigod with one powerful
parent or the equivalent, and lesser amounts of divinity will result in only a small percentage of the
incoming attack being able to affect you. It is also possible for enemies to trick their way past this
blessing, by attacking with an ‘act of friendship’, such as being bitten by a vampire who intends to
turn you into a vampire like them. Finally, your one true weakness that all can strike at, is that one of
your heels were unable to be covered in the fires and not only does that heel lack your invincibility, specifically striking it with enough power to damage the heel will result in your invincibility being
deactivated for a full day."

you, the seemingly perfect immunity to time, weakness and even death itself, preventing you from
being aged or erased from time, from having your body degraded or weakened and from being slain, even from powerful conceptual weapons or abilities. Any wounds dealt to you heal in moments. This
is due to your own connection to the world that you call home. Through your deeds, you have
become such an integral part of the world, even against the wishes of the world, that your life will
exist so long as it does. The planet you begin on, in each universe you find yourself in, will maintain
this lack of frailty or death, provided it has not been made inaccessible totally to any enemies you
might have. Hiding away your home world somehow, even behind nearly impregnable defences, would still see you retain your immortality but making it completely impossible to reach or harm
would sever your own connection for a time. If your home world should be hostile to you in some

much further. When people inflict damage to you, you can convert that damage into magical energy
within you, still suffering the wound, but able to either use that new source of energy as normal or
enhance your body’s physical abilities and rate of healing with it directly. This energy can even be
used to enhance physical objects you touch, from weapons to the debris caused by your attacks, and
enough build up will cause you to grow in size and mutate into a terrifying monster. There is no limit

Saints that could out power enough to obliterate entire galaxies beyond what their number indicates you could, whether you are a Saint or a Titan, your raw strength with that power is mind bogglingly great. You’ve got the raw power to destroy entire galaxies in single attacks and your physical strength can extend to cover multiple galaxies at once. If you are a Titan, you are noticeably stronger than even that."
225,800,Everlasting Savage Engine: Heart of the Strongest        ,Avesta of Black and White,Refinement,"It seems that we have another admirer of the Third Arch-Demon. Perhaps even another member of his household and fellow competitor, a fourth active Locust.

Yours is the core power of the Violent Locust Swarm. The ability that sustains their eternal journey on the path towards transcendence, to the throne of the strongest. That is, you have the ability of growing eternally, becoming stronger each passing second, a peerless warrior incapable of exhaustion. This doesn’t mean that you have any regenerative abilities other than you would have before, but you no longer have to fear having to end a battle due to running out of stamina.

While this engine is always active, the gains it provides when you are doing nothing are basically unnoticeable, even during long periods. It can only shine when you direct yourself to proving yourself as the strongest. That is, when you engage in one-on-one battles to the death. The target doesn’t matter. From the smallest pieces of grass and tiniest insect, to the mightiest Arch-Demons, the only thing that matters is that mutual recognition is established. Surely, a sneak attack would prove nothing of your own strength. Once both parties have acknowledged each other, you must kill the other party using your entire might, regardless of the difference of strength.

As long as you continue fighting this way, your internal engine will be fed and use this battle lust to propel you to greater heights. Your senses become sharper, your punches increase in potency, your skin and muscle become more durable and harder to penetrate, your will is hardened. Obviously, the greater the enemy you face, the more desperate the situation is, the more you will grow. Enemies of your same level or higher will provide better gains that tiny bugs that you can easily crush.

However, be warned that while your growth is infinite, your growth rate is not, and even if your stamina is inexhaustible, this doesn’t make you completely immortal. And finally, while stronger enemies will make you stronger faster, this is only true when it comes to putting you in a more desperate situation. Should they restrain themselves, you won’t escalate as quickly as you would if they were going all out."
226,1000,Barbadium Body,The God of High School Jump,Refinement,"Your body is no longer of flesh and blood. Instead, it is entirely composed of Barbadium, a supernatural metal from the other Realms that surpasses anything else in existence. Every single bit of your body, from your skin to your eyes to your hair is now composed of Barbadium, somehow retaining all the comforts of living whilst enhancing your durability to awe-inspiring heights. Even the Monkey King with his Yeoui, a man who could destroy whole planets with his magical staff, could barely open up more than a tiny gap in the skin of one with a body formed of this metal. Beware though, as the innards of your body, though still formed of Barbadium, and are slightly less durable than your outer shell.

Boosted: Your original form, made from Barbadium, was in truth a crude thing. The Barbadium was just shaped into your body and then your soul was poured in. The metal was not prepared or enhanced beyond that. That was changed. Now your Barbadium body has gone through the full, proper forging processes. Heated, folded, concentrated, mixed with other supernaturally tough materials to make something truly special. While the material itself has become significantly tougher, a blow that might have pierced your skin entirely will only give you a bad bruise now, it's’ supernatural enhancements are what make it truly special. The Barbadium will become more concentrated as your supernatural energies grow, life energy and otherwise, retaining its immense durability no matter how far you grow. It will remain far tougher than you so long as your energies continue to increase. Given your newfound power, at least in your transformed state, it's likely that there are less than a dozen beings in this world that can hope to harm you even with repeated blows, most of which have not even reached that level of power yet.
