1,Free,Alchemist,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Mystic,"Alchemy has lost a lot of power, over the
years, the alchemical formulas have been lost, and knowledge
has been irreparably damaged.
You were born to a family that still saw value in alchemy and
as such trained from a young age in the secrets of medicine.
Maybe you plan to take upon yourself the duty of restoring
Alchemy to its prime?
Can choose any Soul Realm Color up until Yellow."
2,Free,Demon-Slaying Tunes,Demon Slayer,Mystic,"Every superhero needs their theme music...but you aren't a superhero. Instead, you're an epic swordsman or powerful demon, and as such, your music reflects that, as well as the power of anime music teams. You have a personal soundtrack, including your favourite Demon Slayer songs and some custom tracks in the same style, that you can toggle on and off at-will. Oh, you already have soundtrack perks, you say? Well, no problem - just add these tunes into your playlist whenever you want!"
3,100,Coat of Scars,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Mystic,"Some scars look cool. Some look ugly. But, regardless of what people think they look like, they are generally useless in a fight. At least, to other people. For you, the more scarred and damaged a place is, the more durable the area is."
4,100,Sphinx's Curse,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Mystic,"A cunning and wicked creature, one you share a trait with now. At will, you can emit an aura around you that slightly weakens everyone but you in a 10m or so (at first), enough to give you an edge in a tie. It however affects everyone, ally or enemy, and those with a pure heart (either 100% good or 100%  evil) are immune."
5,100,Elemental Proficiency,Saint Seiya Omega,Mystic,"In the wake of the cataclysmic clash between Athena and Mars thirteen years
ago, a profound shift occurred in the powers bestowed upon the Saints.
Henceforth, each Saint gained the ability to manipulate at least one element,
tapping into the primordial forces of nature with newfound mastery. Among the
elemental choices available, including fire, water, earth, lightning, wind, light, and
darkness.choses one."
6,100,Giant's Will,Saint Seiya Episode G,Mystic,"Much like the giants of old, you have a connection beyond the norm with an aspect of nature. Perhaps lightning, perhaps lava or perhaps the dirt or stone. Your chosen aspect is something that you are able to create and control through your cosmo, as well as to feed on that aspect in order to replenish your own energy, particularly given this manipulation of nature has no cost to you. Your powers over it will grow as your cosmo does and you may buy this multiple times to receive more than one such aspect. Taking this also gives you an intimate connection with nature around you, such that you are always far more aware than any human could possibly be of the natural life around you."
7,100,Painting the Battlefield,Demon Slayer,Mystic,"Let's be honest - the thing that makes Kimetsu no Yaiba such a masterpiece, at least in its anime incarnation, is the fight scenes. More specifically, watching the Demon Slayers at work, with their awesome visuals attached to their stylized Breath Techniques. This perk, provided free for the duration of this jump, not only lets you see this amazing stylization, but also lets you distinguish between different fighting styles with a moment's glance! So you know why the Fire and Insect Pillars are actually called those things and demonstrate the fundamental truth that you can look like you're swinging a sword the same way as your friend with a different style, and those swings are completely different. Besides, if you know an enemy's style, you can be better prepared to counter it, right? This may not work with gun-toting goons, but any character with a unique fighting style will be affected."
8,100,Ghosts in the Fog,Demon Slayer,Mystic,"Sometimes, you can talk to ghosts. The exact conditions are kind of vague, but the basics are determined by you when you take this perk, as the ghosts need a certain medium to be visible. So, you get three choices of ""places ghosts might show up to talk to me,"" and these can be asvague as ""pools of water"" to as specific as ""clouds of fog rolling through tall mountains while I'm training."" If you want, you can even have multiple choices be the same thing, because in and of itself, this perk doesn't toggle; if a ghost could show up, there's a 90% chance there will be a ghost there, and some might not stop following you once they realise you can see them..."
9,100,King of Flames,Gourmet Of Another World,Mystic,"You might not think that control over flames is necessary, but it actually is a critically important skill for chefs and many other professions. Chefs and alchemists need to master this to control the duration and temperature of the flames. Warriors need to do so to use more powerful skills and make their attacks more powerful. This perk grants you true mastery over flame control and heating. You will never lose control over a flame and you will be able to freely alter it to the smallest degree. This will aid everyone, allowing crafting professions to make superior products and combatants to become stronger. "
10,100,Image Training,Dragon Ball,Mystic,"Image training is a profound training method designed to transform the user’s ki. It does
this by tempering the user’s spirit, consciousness, and combat instincts. It typically
works by mentally visualizing an opponent and fighting against them in a simulated
battle. You can do this by entering into a meditative state and simulating any form of
combat you can imagine. This allows the user to effectively go through an unlimited
amount of life and death battles without concern about dying."
11,100,Mutation Infusion,A Will Eternal,Mystic,"Exposing normal mundane plants to your spiritual energies will slowly mutate them over the
months and years. The next generation of that plant will have slight spiritual properties.
Constant exposure over the generations of plant life will start to produce proper spiritual
plants, like the kind that sects partake in. A plant whose family has been exposed to your
energies for hundreds of generations would be truly impressive indeed. Post jump this can
also apply for other supernatural energies you may expose to the plants."
12,200,Swat at Flies,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Mystic,"Guns, in the world of today, are rare. Not extremely rare, but rare enough that you only occasionally see one. Regardless, they are potent, able to pierce most armor, especially the more advanced ones. You, however, can change. When attacked with a bullet, or other physical projectile the equal to or smaller than your hand, you can “swat” the bullet from the sky, stopping it from hitting you. You can do this 5 times a day.
"
13,200,Burning Finger,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Mystic,"When you touch someone, you may trigger extreme, unbearable pain in the area you are touching, and you may also cripple the limb you are touching. Useful for threatening, and “interrogation.”"
14,200,Healing!,Street Fighter,Mystic,"There are no timeouts in a street fight, enemies don't wait around while you rest up
between beating the crap out of them. There's never anyone tending to all your wounds and bruises
before you're right back in the fray.
 This perk, however, allows you to be self-sufficient to a degree. By calling out the command
""Healing!"" with a hand outstretched towards the sky, you will become showered in a ray of light that
slowly heals all your wounds and injuries as you stand in it.
 This power does need you to stand still which is an issue, and it can't help you recover from
anything too serious like missing body parts or crushed organs, but being able to recover at all when
you're real deep in a serious situation is priceless."
15,200,Siren’s Song,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Mystic,"Legends tell of a beautiful creature that bewitches
unwary sea travelers with a voice that soothes the heart of the pure, and terrifies the hearts of
the wicked. Your ability to sing has gained an almost supernatural beauty behind it that carries a
similar property - your song can influence the minds of the weak-willed, or cause pain to those
who are wicked. Of course, you can have either effect occur to a person regardless of
disposition, if you prefer. You’ll also be a hit at concerts."
16,200,Legion of the Damned,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Mystic,"The soldiers of Hades are no strangers to
the dead, likely having already been deceased themselves before becoming a true Specter. As
such, you may summon ghosts and mindless undead by focusing your Cosmos outward,
creating an army of the shades of the damned at your will. They will largely be disposable
cannon fodder, lacking the spark of Cosmo that the living or other Specters have...but you will
have no shortage of available minions this way"
17,200,Jamirian Training,Saint Seiya Omega,Mystic,"Maybe you are a disciple of the esteemed Gold Saint Kiki, you have honed your
skills in the ancient art of fixing Cloth and other divine artifacts. By utilizing
stardust sand, a mystical substance imbued with the essence of the stars
themselves. This celestial material possesses the power to mend Cloth and other
divine items with unparalleled precision and efficacy, harnessing the cosmic
energies of the universe to restore their divine essence."
18,200,Genro Maoken,Saint Seiya Episode G,Mystic,"You learned this secret technique of the mind from a cloaked man, who forced the information into you and then left without a word. It is a mind control technique, one done by pitting the force of your cosmo against the power and mental will of your target. If you can succeed, you'll be able to control their mind and alter it as you see fit. You see, the Genro Maoken is special. If you can manage to entirely defeat the opposition of your foe, the mind control will become permanent and irresistible. Regardless of their powers, if they fail once at entirely blocking it, they'll never be able to throw it off and will become an eternal thrall. Even a small amount of resistance remaining would allow this to be, well... resisted."
19,200,Next Gorgon,Saint Seiya Episode G,Mystic,"There's a fair bit of monster blood within you, specifically that of one of the Gorgon Sisters. Your eyes now gain the same magical properties that those snake women possessed, able to turn to stone any living thing that looks at your eyes. Those with great Cosmo, at least as strong as your own, can generally resist but even then they'll find that bits and pieces of their body start to turn to stone with each look into your eyes. Anyone more than a little weaker than you will be petrified with a single glance, much like the mythical battles of old would have it. You are however able to deactivate this effect, if you wish to protect your allies from it."
20,200,Weight of the World,Saint Seiya Episode G,Mystic,"It’s a very satisfying thing, to be able to make the sinners feel the true weight of their transgressions. You are able to turn the weight of sin upon any living being that you can see into pure gravity force that crushes down on them. The more sin, the greater the weight they suffer from and the greater your cosmo, the greater the effect of this ability. Even should he have deeply violated your moral beliefs, you are unlikely to make a Saint bow unless you are as strong as they are. But for those beneath you already, you could crush the life out of them en masse. This ability takes no energy from you to use."
21,200,Mantra,Feng Shen Ji,Mystic,"Mantra is the power of “Desire”, and much like how Desire can be without limit so too is the potential with Mantra. By using specific incantations/spells or setting up certain formations, one can cast a Mantra to magnify their will upon their world. From conjuring or manipulating elements, sealing a target’s movements, altering memories, enhancing one’s physicality, inhibiting a target’s healing factor, teleportation, etc... Mantra is basically a generalist spell casting-system that you now are proficient in using. You start with 2 minor Mantra of your choice and are able to learn more by watching other practitioners, perform trial and error for discovering new Mantras, or by being taught directly (the latter option being the safest option)! Though using Mantra does come at the cost of a portion of the conjurer’s soul or transcendent vigor per cast, which can be recovered with long periods of rest. Overexhaustion will result in the conjurer turning into a “Spirit of Corrosion” - an amorphous black balloon with large jaws, hand tentacles, and red eyes; a fate worse than death according to some (and will count as a Jump Failure for you). So be wary of what you wish for and always know that power comes at a price.
"
22,200,Triple Numbering 312 Skill : <White River Demonic Art>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"White River
Demonic Art is white and pure. It was a crazy demonic art that ate up all of one's
emotions that would get in the way of combat once it was activated. It turned one's

mind white. The user will become a crazy War God who causes destruction until they
wake. Until everything they had enmity against was erased. The fight would only end
if the enemy died or the user died.
A white-mana white-aura reinforcement skill that covers the user's entire body with
bright white flame. The iris of the user will get smaller and smaller as if it was getting
replaced by white. Deadly White Eyes. Something that happened when the whites of
the eyes covered the black parts entirely."
23,200,Triple Numbering ??? Skill : <Dark Sun>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"The user creates a red aura like a
dark sun with his body, immolating all nearby targets, works like an reinforcement
type skill with a powerful aoe ability."
24,200,Daoist Arts,Campione,Mystic,"An Asian form of spellcasting, based on the Feng Shui, Astrology, and other traditional Asian beliefs and centered in the manipulation of qi. Doubling as a type of martial art, it gives the practitioners several advantages that other mages lack, including the ability to cast spells with a set of movements instead of words and manipulating qi (life force) for a myriad of effects. You start with a great grasp of the basics and some advanced techniques, your talent being enough to master this art in a few years of practice."
25,200,Urahara Style Modifications,Bleach,Mystic,"Urahara has crafted quite the arsenal when it comes to artificial spirits, mod souls with greatly
enhanced abilities. As either one of his creations or from someone who copied the designs, you’ve
gained access to one of two innate spiritual abilities. The first is the ability to create illusions, overlaying visual phantasms over an area. It’s maintained by
your energy and the complexity you can manage will increase as your power does, similar to how
you might learn to cover more of the five senses as you grow stronger. Unfortunately, it’s a lot easier
to get out of these illusions, as they exist on the environment and not within people’s minds. All it
takes is leaving the area to be free. The other option is teleportation. You’ll be able to teleport yourself and anyone you’re touching to
any location within range, the range being dictated by your Reiryoku. Even at weak levels, it should
be enough to zip about a town the size of Karakura. You can also create wormholes that can act as
portals, for transporting many over time or to redirect attacks by quickly creating multiple portals.
It’s even possible to create a portal to nowhere, effectively erasing things that enter the portal by
locking them in some unknown dimension. Some foes might be able to break out if they have their
own transportation abilities however. A second purchase of this, discounted if you use your second discount, can be made to gain the other option."
26,200,Human Bomb,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"You can make any part of your body explode, the size of the explosion depending on how much cursed energy you put into it. This can be anywhere from a relatively small right up to the power of a decently powerful missile strike. There’s no need for the body part to be attached to you either, so it’s frequently used by ripping out an eye or tooth, throwing at the opponent, then detonating it when they get near. This technique doesn’t come with any way to regenerate anything used for it though, so try not to use anything you can’t replace."
27,200,Rot Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"With this technique, your blood has taken on corrosive properties, capable of burning through clothes, skin, and even stone to an extent. It’s not a huge threat to a sorcerer – it’d take drowning in it to kill one – but if you manage to get it inside someone’s body, the next stage of the technique can be activated. Known as Decay, floral patterns spread along where you hit them, and their bodies begin to decay from the inside out. It’s not a hugely fast process – even if you manage to get a fair deal inside someone it could still take ten or more minutes before killing them, and hours until their bodies become naught but bone – but it is highly painful, regardless.

It's worth noting that while it doesn’t have a maximum range, the Decay technique needs to be actively maintained – if you release it at any time, the decay will instantly stop and you’ll need to get your blood into your target once again. You also don’t have much control over your own blood: you can spew it from your mouth in a spray, or shoot out many fast-moving lines of blood from yourself if you truly master the technique, but that’s about it. Regardless, it’ll never be capable of the same level of control and versatility of Blood Manipulation, nor reach the same raw power as Piercing Blood – and with this technique alone, you’ll still need to worry about running out of blood."
28,200,Ratio Technique ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"You’re able to score critical hits on anything you attack by striking them at a specific point. By visualising your target as being divided into tenths along their length, you can forcibly create a weak point at the ratio of seven to three, which deals much more damage when struck relative to the energy you used. Notably, you can use this on things other than just a target’s entire length – if you strike the 7:3 point on their torso, their arm, their forearm, or any other part of their body, you’ll score a critical hit as normal. This can also be used on inanimate objects just as well as living creatures."
29,200,Straw Doll Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"This technique functions similarly to the common interpretation of a Voodoo. By taking a part of someone’s body, putting it into or against a straw doll, and then impaling the doll with a nail, you’re capable of injuring that person by causing spikes to suddenly emerge from their body, skewering them from within. So long as you have a body part to use, the range of this technique if theoretically without limit – though you can always skip the doll part by just driving the nails into someone’s body directly. While any part of the body can be used by this, the larger it is, the more effective the technique will be: a hand or internal organ will make it much stronger than a hair or some blood, for example. Also, the stronger an opponent is compared to you, the less damage they’ll take."
30,200,Puppet Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"You’re capable of remotely controlling cursed corpses out to a distance of a few hundred metres. So long as they’re not already animated by someone else’s cursed energy, you can use yours to puppet it with great proficiency. Not only can you share the senses of any cursed corpse you control with this technique, you can use it just as easily as if it were your own body, naturally wielding any abilities they might possess as well as using your own powers and techniques through it. You’re even capable of controlling more than one cursed corpse with this at once, though naturally the more you have active the harder it will be to use them to their full efficiency. Of course, you will need to get some cursed corpses first to use this – perhaps you could learn to make them yourself?"
31,200,Keeping Promises,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"Binding vows were already brought up previously, but it’s worth noting that placing restrictions upon oneself is only part of what’s possible with this aspect of jujutsu. No, binding vows can also be made with others. This often takes the form of a contract between two parties, where both agree to a certain set of conditions, most often certain actions they must do for the other party. Unlike in a self-imposed vow, however, the penalty for breaking a binding vow with another is much more harsh. Though the exact details of what will transpire will vary from vow to vow, the punishment is severe enough that even the most powerful of sorcerers and cursed spirits do their utmost to honour such agreements.

Usually, these require that both parties are capable of manipulating cursed energy. You, however, can apply the principles of a binding vow with anyone, regardless of whether they can use jujutsu or not. When you make an agreement with someone or a group of people, you can choose to make the terms nigh-inviolable as described above. All parties involved will understand that breaking the terms of the contract will result in them suffering severe penalties, far worse than any gain they might have received from not honouring the vow. Naturally, this isn’t a one-sided thing: you, too, will face consequences for breaking such a deal. However, it’s important to note that abusing loopholes in the vow’s wording doesn’t count as breaking it. If you agree to kill someone, for example, killing them and then immediately reviving them afterwards is completely acceptable unless explicitly agreed otherwise."
32,200,Tool Manipulation,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"You’re capable of using your cursed energy to control any broom you’re in physical contact with, allowing it to levitate according to your will. The most common usage of this is for the user to ride the broom, allowing them to fly through the air with surprising agility. It’s also possible to use it more offensively though, swinging the broom at others to send gusts or blades of wind in their direction. These aren’t particularly powerful though, and will likely only slow down any stronger opponents."
33,200,Solo Forbidden Area,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"By activating this technique, you’re able to amplify the total cursed energy amount and output of one willing sorcerer within a certain radius of yourself, which can be you if you choose. It’s not a particularly huge boost on its own, but by elevating your technique to the level of ritual by including elements of chants, gestures, dance, and music, you’re able to boost someone’s power to 120% of their normal level. Because of this, it’s not a technique best suited for direct combat, and is better used for supporting another."
34,200,Weapon Creation,The God of High School Jump,Mystic,"You have the ability to create weapons from nothing but the energy that dwells within your form. Any sort of martial weapon, from swords to spears to whips to hammers, can be created with little more than a thought and then directed with nothing more than your mental commands. Whilst you could simply fire these weapons en masse at any target like they were bullets, you may also wield them as if you help them in your hands, though the concentration to do so will mean that you will have to train to wield more than a small number at once in this way, at least to any great effect. The number and the size of the weapons you create will increase as your own power does."
35,200,Autonomous Puppets,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Mystic,"Many centuries before Monzaemon developed his
own form of the Puppet Technique, the hybrid branch family of the Ōtsutsuki clan on
Earth already used a more advanced form of puppetry, using a different type of
puppets and you, as their heir, inherited this art and their puppets. You receive a set
of a hundred puppets of the same variation used by Toneri Ōtsutsuki. You’re capable
of remotely controlling them through an orb of chakra located within their bodies and,
over time, these puppets will become basically autonomous, requiring no conscious
effort to control them and requiring only your own energy to power their movements.
As an added bonus, you’ll always be able to sense the location of each one of these
puppets and even directly control them when needed. If any of them is destroyed,
they’ll reappear in your Warehouse in the next month and any modification done to
them will remain across Jumps."
36,200,Born From My Will,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Mystic,"You’re able to use the same technique developed by
Kaguya and replicated by Madara, Will Materialization. This technique allows you to
materialize your own will into physical constructs and there are two different forms of
construct to create. The first form is black rods, similar to the ones created by the
Outer Path but have some different usages that enable you to manipulate the actions
of others or even directly control their bodies through implanting these rods into
them. The second form is a malleable and sentient construct, similar to the Black
Zetsu created by Kaguya. This being will be absolutely loyal to you and has the
same intelligence as you, as well as having the same innate abilities of Black Zetsu,
being able to control the actions of others by coating itself over their bodies and
essentially possessing them. There is no specific limit to how many beings like him
you can create and maintain, but the amount of chakra required to do it is a limiting
factor."
37,200,Chakra Constructs,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Mystic,"You’re able to manifest a special red, glowing,
malleable chakra, letting you use it to create tools and weapons made of it, like
swords, spears, claws, stakes, chains, shields, fishing rods and many others. You
can manifest multiple tools and weapons at once and even control them
telekinetically, but they can’t go too far away from you without disappearing, with a
range similar to the Truth-Seeking Balls. These chakra constructs can be
disintegrated like shattered glass, letting you reshape them at will."
38,200,Individual Interpretation of the Arts of War,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Mystic,"Heroes of the Indian epics were rarely so limited in their skills as to only wield a single weapon. Masters of the bow, the spear, the blade and more besides, their skills were worthy of every bit of
power that was ascribed to them. But it certainly didn’t stop certain tools being favoured and that
very power meant that things would often be forced to fit the hero, rather than the hero adapting to
his situation. You discover the ability to force your weapons, tools and even unique abilities or
attacks to take on new shapes to suit your desires. A legendary bow might transfigure to become a
sword in your hand, it’s effects altering to become suitable to a close ranged form while remaining
as faithful as possible. An arrow might instead be subsumed into your form and become a powerful
laser emitted from your eye, now requiring a supply of mana to replace the arrow’s physical form. It
is a change of medium, not of the innate abilities of the targets, but even entire vehicles could be
potentially affected. It is the hero who decides the way battle is fought, not the weapons he is given
to wield."
39,200,Shinsengumi Way,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Mystic,"The samurai code is in reality, a thing mostly of fiction. The many restrictions and honourable rules
that the noble warriors supposedly lived under were fabrications of a later age. Mostly. There were
indeed good men who bound themselves in vows and promises to show their morality, as well as
those who did so to restrain their own dark sides. But the sacrifices made through a warrior’s vow
can have it’s own benefits, the loss becoming new power for battle. 

You are able to take vows that restrict your own life, receiving increases to your overall combat
ability in exchange. The more restrictive the vow is to you personally, the more significant the
increase. Sacrificing a few hours of your time in prayer each week would be a minor boost in power
at best, whereas constant limitations such as never breaking your word or always fighting in an
honorable manner could improve your power by half or even double the normal level. Breaking a
restriction removes the benefit and applies a proportionate penalty to your power on top, as well as
a damaged mental state. These penalties will disappear in time and slowly removing a vow over a
few days will allow you to drop the restrictions without cost. A vow’s power is based on how it
affects you personally at the current moment, something strong for others but weak for you will give
weak benefits."
40,200,Back to Your Prime,Gourmet Of Another World,Mystic,"As individuals age they lose the combat prowess that they possessed while they were younger. To deal with this some techniques have been created that allow the user to revert to their prime. Normally these techniques are temporary and possess some sort of cost. You have somehow gained the ability to mimic this property. By spending a certain amount of energy you can revert someone’s age and make them younger. The amount of energy needed to do this will depend on the individual's age and power. For example, restoring an eighty year old mortal will be effortless. Trying to restore a million year old demon however would require a significant amount of energy. 
"
41,200,Turnabout is Fun,Gourmet Of Another World,Mystic,"Unfortunately many people in cultivation worlds tend to do some evil or dishonorable things every now and then. Some examples of this would be forcefully enslaving you, possessing you, or trying to mentally control you in some way. This perk grants you the ability to flip the effects. Using the examples above, if someone tried to place a seal on you or to somehow dominate your mind then you would be able to do the same to them. This perk is guaranteed to work regardless of the complexity of the technique or any gap in strength. Meaning if a god casually tried to enslave you while you were a mortal then you would end up with a God ranked slave. This will work on any foreign influence meaning that it can function in battle or any other situation as well. 
"
42,200,Divine Powers,Gourmet Of Another World,Mystic,"Divine Powers are incredibly powerful techniques developed by gods once they are acknowledged by the laws they are comprehending. They receive this chance and have the opportunity to craft a unique power. These abilities typically become the strongest ability possessed by the individual. Some examples of this would be the Powers of Affliction used by Bu Fang. Another example would be Summer’s dimensional cube technique. This allows her to form a cube around someone and to rapidly close it while it is filled with spatial blades. This technique is capable of killing anyone that is not significantly stronger than the user. You may purchase this multiple times in order to acquire different powers.
"
43,200,Shaping Of Life,A Will Eternal,Mystic,"This is the ability to graft many different plants together, in a form that still is alive and can
grow. While basic grafts already exist, this takes it to the next level. You can take the
essence, and clippings, of plants and fuse them into a singular complete whole, basically
creating new species of plants. Create a garden akin to that of a treasure trove for
apothecaries. It is important to note that this will not fuse the effects of the plant into one. It
will simply create a plant whose different parts have different properties. Graft too many
plants together and you may struggle when it comes time to harvest and separate it out
again. This skill is closely related to the Dao of Medicine."
44,200,Spirit Enhancing,A Will Eternal,Mystic,"A special ability unique to those from the Arch-Emperor Realm. Using multi-coloured flames
or by borrowing the energy of heaven and earth, one can enhance an object to increase its
strength. Used on weapons they can become stronger, sharper. Souls become more hardy
and powerful. Pills have their effects boosted. These enhancements can be stacked as well,
each additional enhancement increasing the previous effect tenfold. A normal wooden sword
will grow many times stronger from the get go, while a Celestial level treasure will have
negligible gains until the twenty first enhancement. Each step takes more energy, or colours
of flame, and has an increased chance of failure, with failure leading to the destruction of the
spiritual energy of the object, the object itself consequently becoming useless too. Your will
power and confidence will have a marked effect on the success rate of enhancing. In fact,
the more a practitioner succeeds, the more confident they become, and therefore the more
often they succeed. But the opposite is also true. You have something of an affinity for spirit
enhancing, and as such your success rate, and progression in the art, is much better than
most cultivators, putting you in the top percentile wherever you go."
45,200,Freezing Palm,One finger Death Punch,Mystic,"Death Punch bends the elemental air to obey the will of the user. A practitioner of the martial art
can literally freeze their opponents in place with a blow, shards of ice encasing entire groups in place
until ready to be dealt with. This technique requires significant effort, or many opponents defeated."
46,200,Hungry Ghost Manifestation,Abyssals Exalted,Mystic,"You may allow your po, or lower soul, to ooze from your body at night and stalk the world
independently as a hungry ghost. As with the more typical hungry ghosts, this is the lower,
animal elements of the soul turned restless spirit, and appears as a smoky, translucent
image of yourself, the arms and armor it might be adorned with merely cosmetic. These
trappings of armament and mortality fade when it attacks, revealing a leathery, vulpine body
with enormous talons and slavering jaws.
But while most hungry ghosts are turned vicious and feral by improper treatment of their
mortal remains, yours yet remains connected to you and will follow whatever commands you
give it. As the po soul of an Exalt, it is already much more powerful than a normal hungry
ghost due to the Essence on which the soul can batten itself, and it shall further grow in
power as you do. Aside from its wraithly savagery in battle, it can also serve as a relentless
bloodhound and tracker, able to sense the presence of spilt blood and follow the scent of
bloodshed from miles away.
Strong, swift, and deadly, it naturally materializes upon sensing potential prey, turning back
into an immaterial presence when no prey is present, yet may still pass through solid
obstacles when material in order to flee overwhelming opposition or approaching sunrise.
But while it possesses a predatory cunning with which to hunt down and tear apart your foes,
it does not have much ability to improvise beyond murder and thirsts for living blood.
It dematerializes at sunrise to flee back to your body, as other hungry ghosts would return to
rest in their improperly-interred corpses, for the light of the sun would blast it to ash. And if it
should it be slain, your lower soul will return to you ripped and torn, an event which will burn
and stun your mind for a time.
Should you learn the secrets of necromancy required to bind your lower soul to your
shadow, through the Links Born of Tumult, the Essence-suffused shadow it is merged with
further empowers your hungry ghost. Beyond the Essence-charged might and the benefits
usually granted by the spell, your hungry ghost will be a monster cast in your shadowed and
smoky image. It shall wield a mighty panoply of three great powers, each an unique
expression of vast and terrifying might, reminiscent of the powers of Labyrinth and Void
Circle spells. And when it moves to attack, its monstrous form will resemble a chthonic
abomination straight from the nightmares of the Neverborn."
47,300,Five Elements Internal Technique,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Mystic,"Using your Atum, you may attune to one of the following elements: Fire, Earth, Water, Wood, Metal. While resting for 8 hours or longer, you can choose one, and only one, of these elements. When the chosen element is used against you, you can expand the charge in order to completely ignore the attack, regardless of your strength. This ability does not stack and can only be used once per rest."
48,300,Combat Empathy,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Mystic,"­ In battle, you can “read” the flow of your opponent's
movements, understanding where they intend to hit and their thoughts and emotions behind their
attacks. While this may not be useful unless you are fast or strong enough to counter them, you
will still likely know where it is the enemy intends to hit in advance of the actual strike, though
the accuracy of these predictions decreases with the speed and number of your opponents.
Alternatively, you could use this ability to have a civil conversation with someone, expressing
complex feelings and emotions through a series of blows and spirited shouts."
49,300,Cleansing Bloodline,Tekken,Mystic,"Your blood has a curious effect on those aligned with evil and Darkness
similar to the Kazama bloodline. Your touch can soothe pain instilled by those beings and you can
supress corruption by outside forces. With enough practice you would be able to banish evil spirits
entirely. Alongside this comes a high resistance to any corruptive influences from third parties which
could become a downright immunity. For an additional 200CP (undiscounted) you can weaponize it
similar to Exorcists like Claudio Serafino."
50,300,Soul Space,Cradle,Mystic,"Typically at the cusp of Underlord, but sometimes
earlier, Sacred Artists open their ""Soul Space"", a spot in their Core that allows them to store
physical objects without fear of them ever being discovered or taken. The Soul Space can range
from only being able to hold a single bean to being about as large as an entire closet. Yours is
at that maximum size, roughly a 10 foot cube that you can store anything in. Summoning
anything from your Soul Space takes but a thought, as does storing it, and happens about as
fast as you can blink."
51,300,Necromancer,A Will Eternal,Mystic,"In the Wildlands, there is one skill that resides above all others. Necromancy. Using this skill,
cultivators, aptly named necromancers, are able to summon and control legions of dead
souls. These souls aren’t just limited to cannon fodder though. Necromancy makes use of
the foundations of spirit enhancement, medicine concocting, and equipment forging as its
basis. Necromancers can convert these souls into medicine to help with cultivation, or use
them as fuel to produce many-coloured flames. These flames themselves can be used either
to attack others, or used as a medium to spirit enhance things. Necromancy is a valuable yet
difficult skill to learn, as necromancers can do a little bit of everything. While it is possible to
learn this art in the jump, taking this perk also ensured that you have a talent for figuring out
the formulas for further coloured flames. It’s only a matter of time before you reach the rank
of Heavenly Necromancer, able to conjure 21-coloured flame, the stuff of myth. A 22-
coloured flame is powerful enough to severely harm Celestial cultivators."
52,300,Presence Of The World ,A Will Eternal,Mystic,"What a strange ability this is, to hear and talk to the conscious of the world directly. It’s like
your mind has a direct line to the planet below you. In worlds without a conscious, you are
able to ‘awaken’ it with a bit of forceful yelling. In many worlds this may not have much of an
effect, but can make for a good talking partner. Of course, as the consciousness of the
world, they will also be able to monitor, and report back, anything happening on them,
should they wish."
53,400,Switcheroo,UQ Holder,Mystic,"A unique power, one well suited to tricksters and rogues. You have the ability to swap the positions of any individuals or objects within a 100-meter radius of your own position. This is an instant change, and they appear at their new locations in the same position they were before. It’s also possible for you to just take a portion of a creature and swap it with another part of itself or with the air itself, tearing out parts of enemies. Unfortunately, it’s possible for powerful or very supernaturally aware opponents to detect your power’s use and partially dodge.

This is what it appears to be normally, but the truth is quite a bit more impressive. By concentrating and expending great amounts of energy, you can ascend your consciousness to a higher dimension than your current one, letting you look down on the battlefield like a chessboard from high above. Here, you can move around anything through the use of switcheroo with ease, moving through space without difficulty and acting as if time had slowed to practically a halt. It only takes an instant to enter this place, but while there, you cannot move in the normal world. It does massively increase the range of Switcheroo, however, going from a hundred meters to several kilometers."
54,400,Twenty Five Purities Path,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Mystic,"Someone found the book, it seems. Having studied this book, you have gained a multitude of abilities. You are immune to all poisons and diseases, no matter the potency or nature. You are also immune to all attempts to change or alter your mind against your will. Additionally, by studying someone, you can see their weak points."
55,400,Energy Sponge,Street Fighter,Mystic," Handcuffs, prison cells, these are used to detain those who have lashed out at
society. From sinful scum to violent offenders, those who deserve to be locked away. There are
those both evil and strong in this world though, where simple metal bracelets or bars won't work to
hold back their power.
 Upon purchase, you gain the ability to act against martial artists and other fighters who can wield
Ki, Psycho Power and just about any other type of immaterial energy. You have the power to both
absorb and siphon this energy from both the attacks they send your way, and directly from their
bodies to leave them weakened.
 This power works quickly, allowing you to catch Ki blasts right out of the air or dramatically
weaken your target with long enough physical contact, although it can be difficult as the ability
requires some concentration.
 Once absorbed, the energy is consumed by your own Ki, converted into fuel that can reinvigorate
you and give you the power to keep fighting. As a final note, be careful exactly how much energy you
suck up, as your body can only take so much before. . .catastrophic failure."
56,400,The Voice of Ingredients,Toriko,Mystic,"Ingredients in the series somehow have a 'will' of sorts. Through currently unexplained phenomena, there have been Ingredients in the series that seem to have a 'voice', which 'calls' for certain people and 'guides' them into how to prepare the Ingredient in question. People who possess the ability to hear the Voice of Ingredients are shown to have an affinity towards Ingredients.
The Ingredients also seem to have 'preferences' for those that eat it as many believe that rather than a Chef choosing the Ingredients, the Ingredients 'choose' the Chef. Those with Voice of Ingredients will find that ingredients that “speak” to them always are the freshest or well aged, taste better than usual, and so on. This extends to other worlds where ingredients don't have Voices."
57,400,The Path of Orpheus,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Mystic,"Neither the living nor the dead are strangers
to you, for you walk within the Underworld where all souls will one day come to rest. After a
short ritual, you may open a doorway to the afterlife of the world you rest within, letting you enter
it safely and without fear of the environment forcefully making you part of it. What’s more, a
glowing ‘path’ will manifest to a destination within this realm of your choosing, which will led you
safely sojourn to this place. But be warned: This path will disappear if you should stray or turn
your back to it before reaching the end, requiring you to perform the ritual again to make a new
path or hope to find a different way. In worlds without a known quantity of souls or a true afterlife
will take you to a darkened mirror of this world’s Underworld, empty and in a stagnant limbo,
holding the memories of the lives that existed beforehand.
"
58,400,Aries’ Connection,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Mystic,"Sacred armors, especially Cloths here, have memories and sometimes a will of their own, going as far as to be “semi-sentient”. If anyone can build an affinity with his Cloth with time, you can do more than that : you can commune with any Cloth, Surplice, Scale or equivalent in proximity, able to see and/or experience memories of their current or past users, to the point of learning techniques on the spot that way. You can control when to trigger this, but even knowing what to look for, you can’t totally control what you’ll see. Works on any intelligent or similar magic item in future jump.
"
59,400,Grandmaster Inscriptionist,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Mystic,"You have gained enough
knowledge in Inscription Patterns to make you comparable to a
Grandmaster in this art. This only covers up to the Legend Rank,
but, as you reach ranks above Legend, you gain knowledge of
Inscriptions up to the rank you reached."
60,400,Double Numbering ?? Skill : <God of the Skies> ,Reincarnator,Mystic,"A movement skill that allows
the user to traverse instantly hundreds of meters, as the mastery of this skill grows, it
can be used to instantly travel much larger distances"
61,400,Double Numbering ?? Skill : <Thunder King’s Strike>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"A power that allows
one to become the king of thunder. It allows the user to freely control metal and
lightning, a very versatile skill for both offense and defense, the user may even turn
their body into lightning itself when fully mastered."
62,400,Double Numbering ?? Skill : <Claws of Loongken>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"A different type of energy
surrounds your fists when you use it and seven, vicious-looking claws extends out
from the user fists, seven black claws that let out a vicious aura. A skill which focus
solely on offensive power from the Loongken race, a powerful abyssal race."
63,400,Double Numbering 11 Skill : <God’s Right Hand>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"This skill has one
characteristic: Power defeasance. As if it has the authority of a God, if one got hit by
the fist surrounded by this skill then the mana of a skill of a lower level will be
ignored. The power of a higher level skill than that of the God's Right Hand will be
lowered. God's Right hand nullifies most skills. Afterwards, one is able to use the fist
to smash one's opponent. This fist is able to kill most people with a single strike ."
64,400,Double Numbering 19 Skill :<Golden Demon Reinforcement>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"The skill
shrouds the body in golden light, boasts an ironclad defense, and a very solid attack
to match it has two important points: Amplification: Reinforces a person's body and
runes.

Mana Reinforcement: Amplifies the durability and strength of an artifact covered in
the reinforcement."
65,400,Koga Style Wires,Bleach,Mystic,"A special art discovered by Koga Kuchiki, thought to be taught only to his own blade. Yet the method
to use the technique was eventually found by another. With only a small expenditure of energy, you
are able to create invisible threads of spiritual energy from your body, controlled with ease through
only slight movements. While the threads can physically manipulate objects, their strength and
durability decided by your own energy invested, their main purpose is to ‘invade’ other things with
your Reiryoku. Once connected, you are able to manipulate the minds and bodies of other things, the former being much easier than the latter. The reiryoku that is within the enemy’s body allows for illusions to be crafted, affecting all five of
their normal senses. The quality and complexity of the illusions is largely based on your skill and
creativity with this technique, improving with practice from the simple images you can form now. On
the physical side, the threads can immobilise those not more powerful than you without much
difficulty and weaker beings might be able to be controlled like dolls. The threads can be cut or destroyed if hit from a sufficiently powerful source and the illusions have a
special weakness. Anyone who closes off their hearts to you, feeling no empathy or strong emotions
towards you, is able to negate the effect. "
66,400,Miracle Man,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"A cursed technique that activates perhaps without you even being conscious of it, you’re able to store “miracles” you experience in your life for later use. Whenever you encounter a small, everyday miracle – which could be something as simple as seeing a digital clock when all the digits of the time are the same – it is erased from your memory and stored. Then, whenever you would take a fatal blow or are in genuine danger, these miracles are released, allowing you to survive through sheer luck. For example, if the ceiling were above you were destroyed and you were about to get crushed, a miracle might cause all of the falling rubble to land around you instead of on you. Or, if someone were to punch you in the face hard enough to kill you instantly, you might instead only lose a few teeth and go flying, your would-be killer assuming you’re dead.

Though you’re not innately aware of how many miracles you have stored up, there is a visual indication available to you. A number of triangular markings are visible on your body – when you have a miracle stored they become filled in with colour, but become just an outline when this is expended. By default these are located under your eyes, but can be found elsewhere if you choose. You can have up to six miracles stored at a time."
67,400,Domain Amplification,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"While quite a few different techniques for countering domains exist, none possess the same offensive capability as Domain Amplification. A rather complex ability, it involves coating oneself with a thin layer of their own Domain, as if surrounded by water. This has the effect of preventing the user from being targeted by the guaranteed hit effect of a Domain Expansion, but also comes with a useful secondary effect: neutralising the cursed technique of anyone it comes into contact with.

Now, you too are more than capable of using this rare technique, one few even know exist. Its power is such that it can even overcome a cursed technique as powerful as Limitless, bypassing its incredible defence to hit the user directly. However, there are two drawbacks to Domain Amplification: one is that the user is unable to use their cursed technique at all while it’s in effect, and the other is that its technique- neutralising effect can be counteracted by pouring enough energy into a cursed technique. Generally, the more energy you put into Domain Amplification, the harder it will be for other techniques to overcome its neutralisation. Needless to say, you can use Domain Amplification to counter supernatural abilities than rely on sources other than cursed energy, too."
68,400,Technique Nullification,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"You’re able to use your cursed energy to negate the abilities of others. Cursed techniques, barriers, even seals strong enough to trap a special grade sorcerer – all of these can be dispelled by you. Your cursed technique takes the form of beams of light you can fire from your body, or even call down from the sky in a great blast at the greatest extent, nullifying anything made of cursed energy caught within. Due to the unique nature of cursed spirits, this technique is incredibly dangerous against them. It’s worth noting, though, that this won’t be an instant skill, and those strong enough may be able to reinforce themselves to resist this.

As a side ability, your technique also gives you the ability to fly and hover at a decent pace, letting you move through the air roughly as fast as you can run."
69,400,Cloning Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"You’re capable of creating up to four identical clones of yourself using cursed energy, their bodies forming from a gloopy liquid over the course of a few seconds. These clones are completely identical to you in every way, possessing all of the same abilities you do as well as copies of anything you have on your possession, and act according to your will even out to great distances. In addition, since they’re all identical you can switch out your real body with one of the clones at any time, deciding it to be the real you with just a thought. As such, unless someone takes down all of your bodies you’re practically impossible to put down for good."
70,400,Blood Manipulation ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"You’re able to use cursed energy to control your own blood with great versatility. For example, using the extension technique known as Flowing Red Scale, a user is capable of adjusting their body temperature, pulse rate, red blood cell count, and the composition of their blood in order to vastly increase their physical abilities, enough to disappear from someone’s sight in the blink of an eye. The blood outside of your body can be controlled too, such as by coating an arrow in it to let you change its trajectory in mid-flight. As such, Blood Manipulation is more than capable of being used at all ranges. 

Of course, there are also more directly offensive uses of Blood Manipulation. Forming a net out of one’s blood to restrain an opponent, creating spinning disc-shaped projectiles to slice others apart from afar, producing shields of blood to protect yourself from blows, or shaping blood into a knife and rotating it at high speeds to enhance its cutting ability are all possible uses. The most potent, however, is likely Piercing Blood: by condensing one’s blood as much as possible until it becomes a tiny bead then clapping it between one’s hands, the user can fire their blood in a straight line at velocities exceeding the speed of sound.

Despite its power and versatility, the greatest weakness of Blood Manipulation lies in its medium. To counteract the blood loss this technique incurs, users often carry around blood packs or prepare blood-coated weapons in advance. With great skill, users can recycle any blood they use and bring it back into their body, though this expends a lot of energy."
71,400,Healer ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"Cursed energy is capable of great many things, but it does have its limitations. As an innately negative form of energy, it is impossible to use it to heal oneself or others in its base form, for instance. Yet there is a way around this: a method known as reverse cursed technique. By multiplying cursed energy against itself, it instead becomes a ‘positive’ form of energy, and thus can be used to heal. While this sounds simple, it’s a rather complex thing in practice, with many talented sorcerers being unable to grasp the process.

You, however, don’t struggle with this at all, being a true master of reverse cursed technique. The most obvious benefit this gives you is the ability to heal yourself as well as others through physical contact. Though you may leave some scars behind for more serious wounds, with this you’re capable of healing anything from cuts and bruises to slit throats and missing limbs. The more severe the injury and the faster you wish to heal it, however, the more energy will be required, and there are certain things that are more difficult to cure. Poisons, for example, take a lot of concentrated effort to neutralise, and damage to the soul cannot be healed at all.

This is only one use of reverse cursed technique, though: significantly, it can also be used in conjunction with one’s cursed technique. By powering one’s cursed technique using the positive energy generated through reverse cursed technique, its effect becomes reversed. A technique that pulled people closer would be made to repel them, while one that weakened gravity in an area would amplify it instead. While any user of reverse cursed technique would be able to use this, purchasing this perk allows you to apply this reversal of effects to any other supernatural powers you may possess."
72,400,Knight of Owner,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Mystic,"As a manifestation of incredible fighting feats and achievements, a true warrior’s power has
appeared in your hands. The representation of a knight and fighter without compare, this special
ability immediately affects anything you come into contact with and perceive primarily as a weapon
of some kind. It spreads an aura through and around the weapon, in two colours of your choice, and
even as a base effect it will let you achieve an instant and natural mastery of the use of that weapon,
like it was a favoured weapon that you’d wielded for many years on the battlefield. Beyond that skill,
it also enchants anything affected to be a fairly powerful magical tool. While they’re far from an
Excalibur, the enchantments are still quite useful, allowing the weapons to possess unnatural
durability or fire magical blasts of significant power. Even a gun might find each bullet now
possessing enough power to meaningfully harm some supernatural foes. Knight of Owner has no size limitation on what it can affect, so long as you see it and everything
within that might be affected as a weapon first. Even a jet fighter or battleship can be affected, with
your weaponising aura allowing you to control affected vehicles by thought alone. Lastly, the power
will also override control over things that would normally have special requirements for you to use, such as a Noble Phantasm that only the wielder can use via magical rules, a gun that is DNA-locked
to specific people or just a car that you need a key for."
73,400,Into The Way,Cradle,Mystic,"Ordinarily you must be at nearly Archlord in order to begin tapping The
Way, but with this, you're now capable of the most basic ability gifted to those that use this:
Teleportation. You can create Gateways in The Way that transport you to nearly any place on
your current planet, instantly. And with practice you can develop this further to traverse entire
solar systems in the blink of an eye, though it's incredibly taxing to do so."
74,400,Unlocking Your Potential,Dragon Ball,Mystic,"The Grand Elder of the Namekians is an ancient being and the father of nearly all living
Namekians. Arguably his most important ability is the ability to unlock someone’s inner
potential. Additionally, unlike other similar methods this version doesn’t negatively affect
the target in any way. By purchasing this perk you can gain the ability to unlock the
potential of others. This power is slightly draining spiritually, but otherwise has no costs.
To use this power all you have to do is place your hand on their head and call forth their
hidden power. The best part is that this process can be done repeatedly over long
periods of time as it doesn’t overdraft the target’s potential. Lastly, you may also unlock
your own potential with this power if you wish."
75,400,Soul Stamp,A Will Eternal,Mystic,"Much like Archaean realm cultivators can do with Celestials, you are able to leave a mark on
a willing person’s soul. What this does is make it so that should that person die, their
damaged soul will immediately be transported to you whereupon you may either take it for
safekeeping or, if able, rebuild them a body. Due to the damage incurred by this death, their
strength will wane somewhat, and it may take years for them to get back to their previous
strength. You may do this regardless of the strength of either you or the recipient."
76,600,Black Of Venus,UQ Holder,Mystic,"The cursed black spell lives on within you, taking an incredible new form. You’ve been born with the
Magia Erebea spell hidden away inside of you, providing an immense well of power linked to the
Solar System itself should you draw on it. This spell, when mastered, allows one to absorb spells and
take on their properties while the magic is active, though only one spell can be absorbed at a time
and it must be reabsorbed in your next use of this transformation. Magia Erebea also provides an
immense boost in overall physical and magical power when active, separate to whatever you gain
from spell absorption. At first, it will be difficult for you to draw on this power without entering a
berserk state, where you take on bestial attributes and appearances but in time you will master this
power and be able to freely use it."
77,600,White of Mars ,UQ Holder,Mystic,"The Magic Cancel that is so sought after by many powerful factions within this world has woken up inside of you now. This pure white energy is able to nullify and dispel any magic it comes into contact with, preventing it from affecting the wielder and allowing them to easily defeat most wizards that rely on spells to attack or protect themselves with. It can even be used at range from your own body. However, as nice as it all sounds, it is still in an infant stage within you. You will need to unlock and train in its use, learning how to draw it out and direct it against your foes. Until you manage that, it won’t even grant you the passive protection of Magic Cancel. Still, it shouldn’t take more than a few months at most to unlock, and while the Magic Cancel can theoretically be bypassed by powerful enough magic, the fact that it exists as an energy within you means that it can be improved over time, with the right training."
78,600,Archstone touched,Cradle V1,Mystic,"You gain a strange ability, that of the archestone, stolen from the labyrinth. You can attempt to copy techniques that would normally be unique to them, this includes induvial paths, bloodline abilities, and even remnants they’ve absorbed. Using it more than once in day is not recommended, but you can train your resistance to the backlash of this ability."
79,600,God of Fighting,Tekken,Mystic,"The being known as Toshin or Ogre used to be one of the most feared Fighters
of the World. This was not only due to its mysterious origin but also because of its ability to
‘understand entire structures of all living and artificial beings and absorb them’. This same Power is
now yours. You can absorb the Ki and abilities of those you defeat into yourself, becoming stronger
with every victory"
80,600,Blood of Heroes,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Mystic,"The ancient art of forging armor that utilizes the
light of Cosmo is not as lost an art as many believe - for you have unlocked its secrets. You
know how to forge the Bronze Cloths of Athena in ‘black’ replicas that have the same basic
abilities, with none of the drawbacks or restrictions the Goddess places on her own - the subject
need only have basic sensitivity to Cosmo to use them properly. Given years upon years of
effort, you may recreate equivalents to Silver and even Gold Cloths, the armors of the other
Gods, or make entirely new armor of your own."
81,600,Rule the Seas ,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Mystic,"You may as well be an avatar of Poseidon himself,
Jumper, for very little else in this world can match your mastery of the seas and rain. You may
create and manipulate water in this world through your Cosmos alone, able to create city-wide
rain storms out of a clear and sunny day within minutes, as well as move lakes and water
according to your will. With time and training, as your senses unlock, you may perhaps flood the
entirety of Earth and the worlds beyond with water, drowning all who would earn your wrath or
displeasure. You may also walk within water as easily as you would on land, aquatic pressure or
poisons within said water leaving you completely untouched...though the same cannot be said
of others. May the world tremble at your wrath, chosen of Poseidon."
82,600,Rise Again,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Mystic,"There are many heroes on both sides of any conflict,
but death comes for all in time. Still, it’s a shame that such great talents and power cannot be
utilized again...but the God of Death disagrees. Should you have some way to communicate
with or meet the deceased, you may offer a contract of servitude to you or to perform a certain
task for you. If, and only if, they willingly agree to this without supernatural means of persuasion,
you may restore them to life as a new Specter in the prime of their original life, with their abilities
and form brought to match this prime. They will work tirelessly to perform the tasks given to
them - though note this may not necessarily make them completely loyal to you, so mind the
disposition of the revenants you resurrect. They receive a Surplice and a fraction of your own
Cosmo in addition to their previous abilities, but once their task is complete or the contract is
fulfilled, they will return to death once more."
83,600,Fall Into Hell,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Mystic,"All of this being said, death is the final destination -
the only ones who are exempted are the chosen warriors of Hades himself. All others must fall
in line and submit to their fate. The God of Death has shown you personal favor and allows you
to be the Judge of these Dead...when you bring an enemy or adversary to death’s door, you
may kindly help them along the way. Should you choose it, this dying foe will be banished to a
single afterlife of your choosing in a world you have visited before - whether the Underworld or
some other distant realm. If you wish to deny them the pleasure of continued existence, you
may instead wipe their mind, body, and soul from existence completely, leaving nothingness in
their place. Regardless of what you choose, once you have Judged them so, they will never
again escape or return to life - nor may you follow them to their destination, should this be an
afterlife beyond the world you reside in. Pass your sentence carefully."
84,600,Taint Of Darkness,Saint Seiya Omega,Mystic,"Having reached the pinnacle of mastery over the darkness element, you have
become a formidable force to be reckoned with. Firstly, you now possess
resistance to physical attacks and all elements except light, rendering you nearly
impervious to conventional forms of harm. Secondly, your dark attribute attacks
have been enhanced significantly in terms of power, allowing you to unleash
devastating assaults upon your adversaries.
Moreover, you have gained the ability to imprison and seal individuals in the
chains of darkness, restraining foes with a level of power similar to your own.
This ability grants you unparalleled control over your enemies, rendering them
helpless before your might.
Additionally, you possess the capability to taint someone's body with the
darkness element, severely weakening them and inflicting unimaginable pain.
This taint acts as a deterrent, as any attempt to burn their Cosmo will only spread
the darkness further, ultimately leading to their demise if left unchecked."
85,600,Time Destruction,Saint Seiya Omega,Mystic,"Despite the typical association of time-stealing abilities with the Chronotectors
worn by Palasites, you have transcended the need for such equipment. Through
your own mastery and strength, independent of any divine artifacts, you possess
the ability to steal the time of individuals at will. As long as your targets are
weaker than you or have been sufficiently weakened, you can effortlessly turn
their bodies to stone and claim their remaining years as your own. This
formidable power extends even to time-based abilities, granting you unparalleled
control over the flow of time and the destiny of those who dare to oppose you.
With this mastery over temporal manipulation, you wield a fearsome weapon
capable of reshaping reality itself to suit your desires."
86,600,Dimensional Gift,Saint Seiya Episode G,Mystic,"Now space itself will tremble before you. You've gained a unique ability to manipulate dimensions, directed by the energy of your cosmo. There are few limits on what you can do with your manipulation of dimensions, so long as you have the necessary power. You could create portals anywhere within sight or attack through one portal and have the attack exit from another. You could drag yourself and others to other worlds, even transporting entire planets, or just use your dimension traveling powers to cut through most defenses and take away entire chunks or slices of people. You cannot create dimensions nor destroy them with this however."
87,600,Forbidden Mantra,Feng Shen Ji,Mystic,"Though you may have discovered this dark power on your own, this purchase gives you immediate access to a Mantra used to control one of the most feared beings in this world; Spirits of Corrosion. Once a conjurer’s transcendent vigor or soul reaches near depletion, they begin to transform into one of these hollow creatures. Their dark heart, full of unanswered desires, will begin to devour their bodies from the inside out. Corroding the practitioner into a monster that can do nothing but bring disaster to the world. And now you control 9 of these Spirits of Corrosion with absolute loyalty. In their sealed state, these foul spirits appear as strips of black fog with a large maw and singular (or multiple) red eyes that seem to phase between being corporeal and incorporeal at a whim. Their purpose is to eat and devour anything they can tear into, which they are able to instantly digest and crunch any physical matter with little to no resistance. They have been shown to devour energies and powers but not to the extent of normal matter. The Spirits seem to be immune to physical attacks, having a resistance to all other powers, with only a clear weakness to Mantra. Also at the beginning of every new Jump, you gain a new Spirit of Corrosion to add to your entourage (so you’ll never truly be alone if somehow one of your creatures did bite the dust)."
88,600,Cull,Feng Shen Ji,Mystic,"As Nothingness is set to grow wih each kill; so why not reap some of the 
benefits. For every consumed soul from Nothingness, you grow a touch stronger. 
This enhancement isn’t much, no more than 1% at most, but there is no limit to 
this increase as well as it affects all your capabilities (physical, mental, abilities, 
perks). You are also able to summon any of these past victims (with no limit) as 
thrall soldiers for you to command. These thralls hold all of the victim's past 
abilities and memories but they will be scaled down by half of their usual 
attributes. It should also be noted that each soldier will be entirely composed of 
Nothingness, making them highly toxic to touch and under your complete control; 
giving you awareness of all thralls, able to communicate and see through them, 
and being able to summon or unsummon your thralls at will. Any thralls that are 
destroyed can be resummoned in a week unless they are used as a sacrifice for 
another one of your or another one’s abilities. 

Requires Agent Of Nothing(600cp). Possibility to purchase the perk for a discount of 300 cp alongside Cull."
89,600,Alchemy Grandmaster,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Mystic,"You receive all the alchemical
knowledge up to the Legend Rank. When you reach a rank higher
than Legend you receive knowledge of Alchemy up to that level."
90,600,Solo Numbering Skill 3 : <Elemental Outfit>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"Elemental Outfit is a powerful skill
that is good in terms of balance between attack and defense. It attracts the elements
from all around, creates the outfit of an elemental and bestows a power upon the
user to use numerous elements in any way one wants. If one fought in a flaming
desert then a blazing armor will be created. If one fought in a lightning island then a
clothing of lightning will be created."
91,600,Solo Numbering Skill 4 : <Steel Lord>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"Steel Lord gives the user and allies a
powerful body, a troll's regenerative powers, and the agility and power of a beast.
The person with this skill would basically become a lord who has an army of steel
men. It uses a large amount of mana so if one has a tremendous amount of mana
and a person's allies are strong then there was no other skill as good as this. A
person who has a limb cut off can connect it back. Bronze-color light will shine out
from the area of injury as it heals it. If the Rank 2 Solo Number skill, Transcendent
Brilliance, didn't exist, this would be the most powerful crowd buff skill that exists."
92,600,Zero Numbering Skill : <Demon’s Gate>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"Demon's Gate is a skill that entraps
the 13 most powerful demons within the Abyss, the demons who control the thirteen
demonic territories. When the skill is activated, a phenomenon occurs inside one's
mind. A giant shockwave rings out from within the user's head and his vision quickly
darkens. Darkness covers the entire sky, causing the land to fall into shadow.
Lightning strikes down from the dark clouds as the surroundings can no longer be
seen. The land around breaks down and a giant hole appears in which a giant hand
rises up and drags him down. Inside is a dark space like an underground cave but
with a spacious area. Within this area lies the 13 most powerful demons within the
Abyss. From here, you can choose a demon and borrow its strength for a limited
amount of time, however to use such power one must make a contract with these
demons and the price is always something the user holds dear, as these cunning
demons never make a losing exchange.
Should you get this skill, in future jumps it will entrap beings in the same level as the
demons of the abyss are in your current setting allowing the user to channel their
power, you will maintain the power you obtain from them and other beings through
others jumps.
If this ability is mastered and evolved, then it’s possible to trap beings you defeat
within it, creating something akin to Hell, those who are sealed within it would be
eternally bound to the user."
93,600,Zero Numbering Skill : <Demonic Dragon Reinforcement>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"It reinforces and
protects the user's entire body, including their muscles, bones, and tendons. Runes
are amplified while regeneration increases. When used, translucent gold and dark
light surrounds the user. The light can protect the user from the environment such as
toxic water and lava as well as brighten dark areas. By using mana, the light can be

molded into any shape a person wants and can reinforce artifacts by spreading the
light onto it. However, if an artifact is weak then it wouldn't be able to withstand the
power of the reinforcement and would lose its durability fast, until it breaks. The light
can be focused onto a single point, greatly enhancing a weapon's power."
94,600,Zero Numbering Skill : <Mad Demon>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"When the skill is used, the user gains
strength by burning their blood to spew out great power. The pain from burning one's
own blood is not small. To block out the pain, the user's own consciousness is
blocked. Red aura surrounds the user and their eyes turn red. Since the user
becomes unconscious in this state, the only option to stop the skill is through the
destruction of the opponent that was targeted before the user has lost
consciousness, the user will retain memories of his actions during its activation."
95,600,Zero Numbering Skill : <Pandemic Blade>,Reincarnator,Mystic,"Its ability is to create a variety of
magical disease agents that can take the form of viruses, fungi, etc. with various
different effects. It will work for as long as it is supplied with mana. As the mastery of
the Pandemic Blade rose, more spores with fascinating results can be unlocked.
Pandemic Blade can insert its spores into the bodies of people where it will settle
around the muscles, nerves, spine, brain, and heart. It gives the victims a sense of
wondering whether the spores will twist them apart or not. These spores can be used
to torture the victim and force them to obey or die."
96,600,Master of Diremonsters,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Mystic,"Diremonsters are monsters which,
unlike the common rabble that stalk the lands, are able to fully cultivate to the Xiantian Realm.
They cause much trouble, slaughter, and unhappiness in their surrounding areas, but there is one
way to deal with them that doesn’t require death, one way that would be far more beneficial:
Taming. Through forcing a monster, or a Diremonster, to submit to you, you may gain their
undying loyalty and their company as your spirit beast. Normally, most people would only be able
to accomplish this with tremendous difficulty and a lot of preparation time. For you, however,
there seems to be an aura that allows you to easily befriend such beasts as long as there hasn’t been
any earlier history between you. Furthermore, you may find that these beasts will be completely
willing to die for you after being recruited, despite the fact that they may as well be slaves. You
can keep as many of them bonded as you want at a time."
97,600,The Hero’s Sword: Sensory of the White,Avesta of Black and White,Mystic,"Maybe you were once selected to act as a vessel of Ahura Mazda, one of the two sensories of the Truth. Or perhaps, you are a sibling to Quinn, who was made from the corpse of the priestess of the same name and former vessel of Ahura Mazda. Whatever the case, you have gained several of the abilities of the Truth’s sensory for the Good side.

Similar to Quinn, you have the power to collect prayers. In order to accomplish this, you were turned into the equivalent of a telepathic radio platform of a cosmic range, allowing you to receive messages from anywhere in the universe, as well as relaying them or sending your own to any location. This also allows you to read the minds of others by touching them or their blood, even fully synchronizing with the five senses if the opposing party allows it. Be aware that some may resist this effect by their own power, or have a mentality so warped and alien that trying to understand them becomes impossible. Also, you can read memories.

As you gather these prayers, you are able to perform miracles in the same way that the great heroes could. Not only that, but you can also concentrate these prayers into those who gather around you, granting them temporary boosts that may allow exceptional Yatazas, assuming the forces of good are relevant enough at time, to fight against even Special Rank Daeva.

And for the last of your abilities, you are able to turn yourself into a sword, which would require a godly level of strength to be damaged, and thus could also be used to slay even the gods in the right hands.

Finally, due to your special nature, all of these gifts are not tied to the continued existence of the Truth, or her favor."
98,600,Evolution of the Soul,Bleach,Mystic,"At the heart of all things is the soul, the holy grail from which the world can be manipulated and
controlled. To create and alter the soul, and life in general, could be said to be the highest and most
worthy form of science. Your knowledge of alteration and even creation of souls or biological life is a
match for the greats, men like Urahara and Kurotsuchi. Provided you have the tools, it is entirely
possible for you to craft new beings from spirit particles, designed to your specifications down to the
molecular level. Such a project is grand even for you, meaning that lesser modifications or enhancements are quite simple. Giving someone the ability to melt into liquid and reform in a safe location? Rudimentary. Altering the appearance of a Zanpakuto Spirit or potentially even it’s abilities? Possible, enough to offer it as a paid service. New species entirely, such as the Gikon or the Bount, would never be
accidental creations but the results of purposeful development in your lab. You’re not all that good
at fixing the injured compared to a healer of your level but you’re very much able to make people
into terrifyingly powerful bio-spiritual monsters, if they’re not too squeamish. Though beyond you now, the potential lies even for you to discover the secrets of resurrection, resuscitating lost or mostly destroyed souls and lives even hours after they have passed on.
Interfering with the cycle in such a form may bring trouble your way but...the science of the soul
calls to you and what greater expression can there be? It’s only natural to progress, as your existing
mastery is complemented with the sort of incredible talent that got you here in the first place. Who
knows what sort of grand spirits or monsters you might create in time."
99,600,Shrine,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"Shrine is the Cursed Technique of Ryōmen Sukuna: the ability to sever and slice nearly anything, as long as you have the necessary CE output for it. With this ability, Sukuna was capable of shredding entire city blocks to dust, while a single activation could slice skyscrapers in half, its scythes capable of cutting at the world itself, bypassing all but the most esoteric defenses. With this ability, you gain three avenues of attack: Dismantle, capable of being launched at any range, as well as Cleave, a stronger attack that adjusts based on the durability, but requires physical contact unless your target is within your Domain Expansion. Finally, Fūga, an extraordinarily potent attack, but with limited range and slow speed, though Sukuna's Binding Vow turned it into his trump card."
100,600,Cursed Energy Discharge ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"Perhaps the simplest of all cursed techniques, you’re able to fire off beams of raw, concentrated cursed energy. What this lacks in versatility though, it more than makes up for in power, possessing the greatest output of all cursed techniques. At its most powerful, you can unleash a wide beam of energy by charging up for a bit, strong enough to destroy several city blocks in a single shot and leave nothing but rubble in its wake. Though they may not be as powerful, your regular beams are nothing to scoff at, either. Not only do they have the power to pulverise concrete and tear apart buildings with little effort, you can also fire off several at the same time, independently controlling each of their flight paths to make them follow your target with unerring accuracy. Likewise, your range with this is also incredible, able to precisely target your beams even hundreds of metres away from you.

With a rapid volley of these normal beams bombarding them from the sky, your strength with this is such that you could even give a special grade sorcerer trouble, to say nothing of what you could do to lesser sorcerers. Truly, only sorcerers on the level of Gojo or Sukuna could hope to rival you in raw power alone with this, and that’s only if they have a technique suited for such a thing."
101,600,Star Rage,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"You have the ability to add virtual mass to yourself. Due to its imaginary nature, any mass gained through this technique doesn’t slow your movements or hinder your mobility at all, but instead vastly increases the power of your blows. With a single punch using this you could exorcise a special grade cursed spirit, or severely injure a special grade sorcerer and send them flying despite using their cursed energy to reinforce their body. As such, your striking power is completely unparalleled.

There’s no limit to the amount of mass you can add to yourself, the amount that you gain only being restricted by the cursed energy you put in. However, although it is almost immeasurably high, there is a point at which you start to become affected by the virtual mass you add: the point at which you become so heavy that your body condenses into a black hole. Though by your will you can suppress it so that it only affects a certain radius around you and disappears after a certain amount of time, unrestrained this is a true black hole, able to destroy the entire world. Unless you have some way to survive this, it’s probably best to keep it in reserve as a last resort.

Your cursed technique also inherently comes with a shikigami: a bony, serpentine creature known as Garuda, with eight small wings that allow it to fly. The main use of Garuda is to enhance the variety of your own attacks, as you can also apply Star Rage’s effects to it. You could grasp it by the tail and swing it like a whip, make it roll up into a ball and throw it as a projectile, or command it to ensnare someone and weigh them down. It’s also capable of attacking separately from you, and to great effect if you use your technique to bolster it. Though it can be killed, it will revive after 24 hours if this happens.

The only real downside to this technique is that, because the mass it adds is virtual, your tensile strength doesn’t increase with it, making you only as durable as you would normally be."
102,600,Ten Shadows Technique,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"You’ve gained access to the hereditary cursed technique of the Zenin Clan, which focuses on summoning shikigami (familiars similar to cursed spirits, often with abilities of their own) using specific hand signs and one’s shadow as a medium. As its name implies, the Ten Shadows Technique has ten shikigami that can be summoned through it, with more powerful shikigami requiring more cursed energy to summon.

By default a user begins with only the first available to them: the Divine Dogs, a pair of wolves, one black and one white, that can be used to defeat weaker curses and for tracking. To gain access to the other nine shikigami, the user must first summon them using a ritual. When brought out in this way they will initially be hostile, but will fall under the user’s command if they can defeat them without any outside help. Eight of the other shikigami are as follows, with the ninth currently being unknown:

Nue, a masked bird large enough to lift someone into the air and carry them for a short distance. Aside from its ability to fly decently fast, the main draw of Nue is its ability to produce electricity from its wings that it fire off at-will, which can hit hard enough to exorcise weaker opponents and even stun relatively strong ones for a while.

Toad is a man-sized version of exactly what its name implies. It doesn’t have any impressive abilities, its only notable feature beings its tongue, which extends relatively quickly and is strong enough to lift and throw human targets with ease.

Great Serpent is an enormous white snake, large enough for a human to easily fit within its mouth and long enough to reach dozens of metres into the air. If it has any special abilities, they aren’t known.

Max Elephant is a pink elephant with the ability to output large amounts of water from its trunk, enough to flood a wide corridor or a room in moments, and with enough force to barrel a man off his feet. It also happens to be rather heavy, more than enough to crush someone if you dropped it on them from above.

Rabbit Escape is a swarm of hundreds of white rabbits. They’re each about as strong as a regular rabbit, so this shikigami is mainly used to distract or confuse an opponent. They can be directed to work together though, piling up on each other to create simple structures like walls or hollow balls.

Round Deer is a four-eyed deer large enough to fill a corridor. Its main use lies not in direct combat, but in its ability to use reverse cursed technique, which can be used to both heal the user and counteract cursed energy used against them.

Piercing Ox is rather simple, taking the form of a black ox. It doesn’t have any abilities other than charging straight towards things to ram them and it can only move in a straight line, but the longer it charges the more powerful it becomes, to the point that it can knock back one of the most powerful sorcerers of the Heian era with a brief windup.

Mahoraga is the strongest shikigami by far, taking the form of a large, powerfully- built humanoid with two feathered wings in place of each eye, a blade attached to its right arm, a snake-like tail extending from the back of its head, and an eight-pronged wheel hovering above its back. Even with its physical abilities alone it’s a threat to even the strongest sorcerers, hitting hard enough to punch its foes through several buildings, and the blade on its arm, the Sword of Extermination, is a cursed tool coated in positive energy, which is anathema to cursed energy and especially cursed spirits.

Its most powerful ability, though, is its power to adapt to the whatever it faces. If it or its user is hit by an attack, the wheel above its head will begin to rotate, and when it has made a full revolution it will have fully adapted. An attack that worked on it before will no longer affect it – similarly, if it encounters a defence it can’t pierce it will adapt in order to overcome it. It doesn’t just stop at once it has though, but instead continues to search for better, more effective adaptations. For example, when it initially came into contact with Gojo’s Limitless, it first changed the very nature of its cursed energy to overcome it, then switched to cutting space itself to bypass its defence entirely. As a result of this power, though, no sorcerer of the Zenin family has ever succeeded in subjugating it. 

In addition to the shikigami above, it’s possible to temporarily fuse several shikigami into a single summon, combining their forms and abilities at the cost of increased cursed energy usage. Users are also capable of using their own shadow to store objects, though they still experience the weight of anything kept inside, and even entering other shadows in order to hide inside of them.

Aside from the aforementioned limitation on which shikigami can be summoned, there is another major flaw: any shikigami that is destroyed will be unable to be summoned again. Fortunately, it’s possible to dismiss any shikigami with a thought, whereupon they will be fully healed when resummoned, and the energy of any dead shikigami will be inherited by the others who survive, empowering them proportional to the defeated one’s strength. Merged shikigami are also not subject to this, their constituent shikigami not being permanently destroyed upon the fusion’s death. Any dead shikigami will optionally be restored after ten years or at the start of the next Jump, whichever comes first."
103,600,Judgeman,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"With your cursed technique you’re able to summon a shikigami known as Judgeman, a large figure in a black cloak shaped like the scales of justice, with a white mask for a face. It has no combat ability on its own, but is instead a vital part of Deadly Sentencing, the Domain Expansion that is inherent to your technique. Upon activating your Domain, you and your target are brought into a courtroom where all violence is forbidden, with all parties being completely unable to harm the other.

Instead of physical combat, however, those within are forced to engage in a trial, with you as a prosecutor, the target the defendant, and Judgeman as the impartial judge. Judgeman inherently knows everything about everyone in the Domain (though you do not share this knowledge), and will use this knowledge to accuse the defendant of a crime they committed. Furthermore, as the prosecutor you will also be given an envelope containing evidence related to the trial, though it is not necessarily conclusive, and only you will know that is inside. This evidence could, for example, be a photograph of the defendant at the scene of the crime they were accused of committing.

Without knowing the evidence, the defendant is tasked with making a statement to prove their innocence, though they may choose to remain silent or confess if they see fit. You may then use the evidence given to you to present a rebuttal. Once both statements have been made, Judgeman will render a verdict based solely on them. If the defendant is deemed innocent, the Domain will end. If they are found guilty, however, Judgeman will sentence the defendant, resulting in a punishment. Though more severe crimes tend to result in worse punishments, even you can’t be sure which one it will be.

One sentence given by Judgeman is confiscation, which will cause the defendant to lose access to their cursed technique – or, if they lack one, their cursed energy. The harshest is the death penalty with confiscation, which will not only apply the above effect but also give you the Executioner’s Sword – a blade of light that will instantly kill anyone cut by it without exception, though it can only be used upon the defendant given the death sentence.

In addition to the above, you’re also able to summon a special cursed tool with your technique in the form of a gavel. This cursed tool can change its shape according to your will, such as by extending its handle for greater range, turning it into an enormous mallet to crush your foes, or even giving it a level of fluidity, allowing it to weave past their defences and catch them with a hooked head. So long as it’s still vaguely hammer-like, it’s possible. You can also summon and dispel it with a thought.

There are only a few limitations to this technique. One is that in order to use Deadly Sentencing, you must explain the rules of the Domain to the defendant. The other is that so long as the target denies their guilt they may request a retrial, which will forcibly open the Domain once again, though they will be tried on a different charge the second time around."
104,600,Limitless,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"You’re can use Limitless, the cursed technique of the Gojo family. This, in short, is the ability to bring infinity into reality, which in practice functions as a form of space manipulation. In its most basic form, referred to as Infinity, this takes a layer of space surrounding the user’s body and extends it into infinity. Functioning similarly to Zeno’s paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, anything that approaches you gets caught in this space, slowing down as it gets closer until stopping entirely, never actually reaching you. This acts like an impenetrable forcefield surrounding you in practice, with any attacks sent your way being unable to actually hit you. There are some ways, however, to breach this defence: techniques or cursed tools that nullify cursed techniques, effects that bypass space entirely, and attacks that cannot miss, such as from a Domain Expansion, are all known examples.

Limitless isn’t restrained to being used defensively, however: it also has several potent offensive uses. Blue is the amplified form of Limitless, which acts as the ability to attract by manifesting negative distance into reality. The effects of this are broad: it can be used to pull things towards you, tear apart buildings brick by brick, or something as precise as crushing someone’s limbs by affecting several different parts of them with Blue. It doesn’t just have to pull things towards you, either – it can also be used to pull things towards a specific point in space, often manifesting as a blue orb of energy that functions like a black hole that can be moved at-will, or even to pull you towards a specific point in order to act as a form of high-speed movement.

There also exists an inverse form of Blue, known as Red, which requires mastery of reverse cursed technique in order to use. As Blue’s opposite, Red acts instead as the ability to repel. While used in a similar manner to Blue, Red is at least twice as powerful, and often takes the form of a small ball of blood red energy – a direct hit is more than enough to blow a large hole through most things it hits, or at the very least send a target flying for hundreds of metres with enough force to tear apart the entirety of their surroundings.

The most powerful form of Limitless is Hollow Technique: Purple, the fusion of Blue and Red. By combining attraction and repulsion, an imaginary mass is created in the form of a large ball of purple energy, then shot forth. The power of this cannot be understated: while it doesn’t literally erase anything it touches, it might as well do for most matter it comes into contact with, leaving only empty space in its wake. Only those standing at the absolute peak of this world in terms of power and skill, would be able to resist it, and even then not without serious injuries.

There are more uses of Limitless besides these. It can, for instance, be used to teleport the user and anything they’re touching long distances. It has been stated certain conditions are required for this to function, though unfortunately these are currently unknown. The main flaw of Limitless is its complexity: without also possessing the Six Eyes, it’s almost impossible to use effectively due to the immense precision and high energy costs required."
105,600,Living Disaster,Jujutsu Kaisen,Mystic,"Your cursed technique embodies some sort of natural disaster, letting you manipulate it with both great power and versatility. The known examples of this kind of technique include Jogo’s pyrokinesis, Hanami’s plant manipulation, and Dagon’s hydrokinesis.You may select one of the above, or choose something entirely different with a similar power level to the examples given below.

Jogo’s pyrokinetic abilities, for example, allowed him to create enormous blasts of flame from his hands capable of burning down vast areas and seriously wounding or killing grade 1 sorcerers. Aside from this, he was also capable of generating small volcanos to emerge from surfaces at a distance and violently erupt; producing fist-sized ‘Ember Insects’ while flew towards a target, attempted to sting them (to unknown effect), then exploded; and even creating an enormous flaming meteor capable of destroying much of Shibuya.

Hanami’s ability, on the other hand, allows for the creation and manipulation of plants with various special abilities. On the simpler end, this can be used to produce various wooden constructs: roots to entangle and throw enemies about; spikes of wood that emerge out of the ground; vast masses of roots the size of a large building; and balls of wood from which branches can emerge mid-flight to skewer those around it. On the more complex end, this can also be used to produce such things as a field of flowers that distracts and disorients those caught in it or buds that drain the cursed energy of whoever they latch onto."
106,600,Awakened Bloodline Limit,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Mystic,"The kekkei genkai are anomalies found in the
DNA that allows their wielders to use unique techniques and usually passed down to
the wielder’s descendants. While some of them emerged naturally thanks to
mutations, many of them have some kind of connection with the Ōtsutsuki clan,
being wielded by Kaguya’s descendants, but these inherited gifts became diluted
and much weaker than their original versions, the kekkei mōra used by our clan. In a
few words, the kekkei genkai usually are just pale imitations of the kekkei mōra. For
example, the kekkei genkai version of Shikotsumyaku allows the user to manipulate
and control their own skeletal structure while the kekkei mōra not only allows it on a
greater degree, but also make their bones completely lethal to living beings, making
them to deteriorate and disintegrate at a molecular level after piercing them. You can
choose a kekkei genkai to receive its kekkei mōra version, gaining an incredibly high
power boost, new abilities and/or removing its limitations, on par with the power of
the All-Killing Ash Bones technique. It’s up to you to choose the specifics and
attributes of this kekkei mōra. For example, if you choose the Ketsuryūgan, your
Ketsuryūgan, as a kekkei mōra, would be able to easily enter into your targets’ minds
without any difficulty and its iron manipulation would become powerful enough to
control even solid iron at a molecular scale and not only liquid with a high iron
concentration, like blood, as well as being able to cause much more alterations and
mutations by manipulating blood within their bodies than just making them larger or
exploding them. You can’t choose kekkei mōra granted by other perks in this Jump
(like the Rinnegan, Sharingan, Rinne Sharingan, Byakugan and the Tenseigan) and
techniques that are classified as kekkei mōra. You can also choose to upgrade
elemental kekkei genkai. This can be purchased multiple times."
107,600,I Love Swords So Much,Ragna Crimson,Mystic,"For a Dragon Hunter, his silver sword is his life. The tool that he can use to freeze dragons and stop their regeneration. But perhaps you took this quite too literally, as you have started to become one with your weapon of choice. 

It will take time for this process to start taking place. At least a couple of years of using a weapon constantly will be needed for it to begin, and a few more to finalize. But once you are done, your abilities will fuse together with that of your weapon, allowing you to channel magnified versions of whatever powers your weapon had, infusing other items or weapons with the same powers and even create copies out of thin air of the weapon you fused with, all of an extremely high quality.

Finally, you are able to temporarily bring your body to an existence closer to the weapon you are fused with at will, allowing you to gain increased defensive capabilities, as a sword is harder to break than a human. This however has the drawback of making your articulations stiffer the closer you bring yourself to your absorbed weapon, to the point that you may lose any movement capability until you undo the transformation if you go too close into your ‘weapon mode’.

You can only fuse with a single weapon at a time, but unlike Ragna, you can undo the fusion process and choose another weapon to begin fusing with."
108,600,Saint of the Sun,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Mystic,"If there was ever a morning person, you’d be the guy. And also an evening person, funnily enough. Why? Because it seems like the sun just can’t get enough of you. During the hours of 9AM to 12PM
and 3PM to 6PM, you’ll find that the sun charges your overall power and individual abilities until
they are three times their normal power, at no further cost to you than normal. Additionally, any
damage you receive in this state is greatly reduced, enough that attacks that might harm you
normally are now barely even scratches. If you could find some way to maintain the presence of the
sun in a condition similar to the hours of power you have, you might even gain this boost for longer
than normal. Lastly, even when outside of your normal hours, you can briefly activate the sun power
for a few seconds, though this is terribly tiring."
109,600,Hero King,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Mystic,"Indeed, Charlemagne conquered Europe through his prowess as a king. The heroic legends are just a
fantasy. A fanciful tale. But the world needs those ridiculous, absurd, wonderful heroes just as much
as it needs the realistic, practical kings. The charisma of a hero is not the sort that leads nations but
the kind that binds people to you personally, making those you fight alongside or save into close
friends in short order and lifelong comrades without much more effort. You might not give people
faith in your governance but you inspire people with the hope that they can follow you out of any
darkness they find themselves in. But a hero is much more than just their charisma. The brilliant holy light shines forth from you, a sign
of the great power you hold. You are able to use this light, a powerful form of magic, to enhance
your physical body to move beyond sound itself or smash through castles like a house of cards, even
letting off mana bursts, flashes and blasts of light in different forms. As part of your heroic
experiences until now, you are also highly capable with most traditional forms of weaponry for
knights and heroes, like the sword and lance and bow. The light greatly empowers your offensive
and defensive abilities against the foes of your religion and those beings that call the darkness their
home, letting you cut through heretics and devils like you were thrice as strong as normal and
making you similarly tougher to their returning strikes. Lastly, for whatever whim of the heavens
causes it, the light continuously acts to put you in the most dramatic of scenes and visions, ensuring that everyone that looks on you can’t help but think- that hero is simply the coolest thing. Charlemagne would be proud."
110,600,Never Unaware,Cradle,Mystic,"The Bloodline Ability of the Aurelius Clan, the Aurelius Senses, the
power that borders on Omniscience? Yeah you've got that now. It starts out as only being able
to see, hear, and feel anything within roughly 100 feet of you, but with practice and growing
power, it can in theory encompass an entire world. Never be caught with your pants down
again."
111,600,Always Armored,Cradle,Mystic,"The Akura Bloodline Ability, the Shadow Armor, is now yours to
command. This armor can be summoned at will, and protects you against nearly all harm so
long as you can sustain it with magical energy, though Madra works best, specifically Shadow
Madra. It's heavy, bulky, and takes some getting used to, but it can be dismissed and
summoned in a near-instant as needed. The harder the blows you're stopping with this armor, of
course, the greater the magical drain, so don't expect to keep this up for too long in a heavy
fight."
112,600,Waterswamp Kingdom,A Will Eternal,Mystic,"You have a unique connection to a powerful beast from the technique of the Waterswamp
Kingdom. By studying various creatures one would usually connect to their own summoned
creature. The number of creatures studied and their own cultivation would determine the
creature summoned, which would remain unchanging afterwards. As said though, yours is a
more unique monster. It is malleable. As you continue to study more animals, and meet
more exotic creatures, your summoned beast will mutate to match. A note of caution though,
is that if your summoned beast is too large, you may not be able to summon it fully, only
letting small parts of it through until your Kingdom can grow in size to accommodate it, as
you increase in cultivation."
113,600,Sentient Limbs,A Will Eternal,Mystic,"By cutting off one of your arms, you are able to make a sentient clone that will follow your
will. Though to call it a clone is not quite right, since it is simply a sawn off part of your soul.
Its own power will be proportional to its weight relative to your body. At any point, the clone
has the ability to re-join with your body seamlessly. Unlike the Ghostmother however, this
clone does not have any thoughts of suppressing your soul or trying to take over. It is simply
another part of you. As it is part of your soul, should the main body die, this clones body can
take the place of the original, your soul slowly regrowing to replace what was lost. While
using this clone though, as it is not just the limb but the soul of the limb too, your limb will not
regrow."
114,600,Conquest of Life,Abyssals Exalted,Mystic,"The Neverborn expect their Children of Ash to lead the forces of the dead into Creation
through the shadowlands and crush the armies of the living. They will be the ones to kill the
world. But first, they will conquer it. Yours is a genius of warfare, the mind of a general and

the authority of commander. Through your military skill, the lands of the living may fall one by
one. With each battle and each conquest of land, you may create a shadowland to cover
these, spreading and strengthening the Underworld's grip on the land of the living. You may
even turn and take the lands of the dead for yourself, creating shadowlands there as
beachheads into the living realm.
And as you conquer, you may press the living into service in your legions, for beneath your
banner the living and the dead march together as a single, cohesive army. Mortal, ghost,
and zombie alike, each will march and fight together like a well-oiled machine on your
command. Even the mindless followers and minion among them, those skeletons, zombies,
and necromantic warmachines of the reanimated dead will follow your orders with such
competence that it almost seems as if they could actually think for themselves."
115,800,Black Of Venus - Mastery,UQ Holder,Mystic,"Magia Erebea has been mastered by you, the dark forces within settling down
to a much easier to use method. Not only are you now able to absorb spells and gain access to
custom super modes through that process, you are even able to freely access the normally Berserk

state of Magia Erebea while retaining your mind, allowing you much greater strength and speed and
magical power without the loss of control that is normally forced on you. You are also exceptionally
good at refining the spells you absorb with Magia Erebea and expanding on those transformed
states to make them even stronger. If you also possess the White of Mars, you’ll be able to use the
well of power within you in the same way as Touta Konoe learns to, drawing out unlimited amounts
of energy or creating massive demonic forms or even embodying that raw black and white power
yourself."
116,800,White of Mars - Mastery,UQ Holder,Mystic,"You’ve put in all the time needed to truly master the use of the White of Mars. The passive Magic Cancel is fully active in you and as powerful as can be. You can use the Magic Cancel at range as freely as if it were another limb in your body, wiping out any magical spell you can see and even tearing apart entire magical worlds to bring back reality around you."
117,800,Eight-Nine Arcane Art,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Mystic,"The Eight-Nine Arcane Art, also known as the Seventy-Two
Transformations, is the single greatest defensive Divine Ability within the Three Realms. The art
allows novice practitioners to fully transform and shapeshift themselves into whatever they wish,
even emulating the aura of what it is they wish to mimic, giving any opponents no chance to see
through the deception. However, this is not the most valuable part of the technique. When fully
mastered, the Eight-Nine Arcane Art allows the user’s body to become harder than weapons made
to kill Pure Yang True Immortals, beings capable of easily standing on the surface of a star. There
is, however, a cost to this technique, which is the absolutely mind boggling amount of spirit pills
required to forge the user’s body into something greater, more than even most Daofathers can
afford. However, as amazing as that version of the technique is, this one details how to move past
even that level, and is capable of turning your body into something comparable to a Chaos
Weapon, allowing you to survive attacks that would end entire Major worlds without even
flinching. Before practicing that part, however, you need to break through to the level that Nuwa
had been born into, The Elder God level, and find an even more ridiculous amount of treasures and
essence in order to train to it."
118,800,Stellar Princess: Failed Protagonist,Avesta of Black and White,Mystic,"Within you there is a very special light, one gifted by God herself. When that light peers through your most common actions, such as a simple smile, it becomes capable of charming almost all sentient beings with little effort. You become an idol, an object of worship, respect and protection for almost anyone who witnesses you. Only those with the strongest wills may be able to resist the natural charm of your existence.

This is not a coincidence or an exceptional occurrence. Originally, you were meant to be the Hero of this generation. The greatest good that would face off against the Kings of Evil, and bring change to the current cycle. At least, that was the plan. Instead, your rights were lost due to an unaccounted for anomaly. However, God, who originally bestowed you with such a role, saw fit to compensate you.

Instead of taking the role of the Hero, your new status made you become the most prominent person under the Heavens. That is, you had the ability to charm and command anyone but those who stand equal or above the Heavens, those with the wills to defy God or the Gods themselves.

This is especially potent when it comes to commanding nature itself. As extensions of the Avesta, Star Spirits, some of the mightiest existences of this universe, are completely under control. You are able to communicate with them even from across galactic or intergalactic distances, drawing them to you under your command. This is a control that transcends the Avesta, and only those with a latent universal divinity of their own may resist you.

Once you have put enough of these spirits under your control, your may condense all of existences into a singular point, allowing you to craft a weapon that contains the accumulated powers and abilities of all who were put under your command. This weapon is naturally just as subservient to your will as the spirits were, and can be freely summoned or diminished at will. In future jumps, your existence will be recognized as equally predominant, and those spirits and manifestations of the natural forces that are below the cosmic scale will be forced under you in the same way."
119,800,UnEquivalent Exchange: Coverous Jumper,Avesta of Black and White,Mystic,"A power reminiscent of a now long-lost star. Yours is the power to gain something via losing something else. By sacrificing and spending your riches, you can gain even more riches. While the usage of this power requires you to keep giving up things to receive more power and fortune in return, it also makes it so that there is no true loss as long as you are concerned. In fact, instead, you end up with more than you lost before.

Even a Star Spirit with this trait could decide to drain dry their own Stellar Body and its people, and instead of getting weaker, they would get stronger. Similarly, you could also trade injuries in a fight for receiving special powers, or subtracting those from your enemies. Perhaps something like losing an arm would see you stealing your foe’s arm and gaining some of their abilities.

Of course, there is a limit to this. You cannot give up your own existence in hopes of gaining something greater, as there would be no one left to receive the resulting blessing from such expenditure."
120,1000,Silver Arts ,Ragna Crimson,Mystic,"A miraculous ability achieved by the man who would become the pinnacle of dragon hunting. The fusion of a human and a silver sword due to continuous use, and maybe some other freakish modifications and coincidences. The Silver Arts are not properly a magical ability, but rather an ability that exists to combat magic. They confer the user a physical power and speed nigh unrivaled, on the same realm of those that even only a handful Seija can hope to reach. Destroying large castle wards with a punch and sending someone flying kilometers away with a kick, just to get near them again in less than a tenth of a second is just some of one starting to grasp the potential of the Silver Arts could accomplish.

Your touch is deadly to any dragons, being instantly frozen the moment you extend your hand towards them. You can even do this with several dragons in a large area, freezing dozens of them by releasing your silver aura. The same goes for their magical power, which either gets completely frozen and broken by your touch, or at least makes you highly resistant to them. In future worlds, this would extend to all sorts of magic-based creatures, although the strongest of them may be able to resist this power, needing to combine it with your strength and speed to break through their defenses before being able to use your silver aura on their cores.

The fusion within your Silver Sword has granted you the ability of summoning silver swords from thin air, all an extreme quality, as well as infusing other silver swords or weapons with your potent silver aura power.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with this power, as even more uses could be mastered with enough battle experience and training.

Normally this power would possess a deathly toll onto the body, with continuous use probably killing you in over a year, but you find that it is merely physically draining instead of life threatening. Unless you really wish to go beyond that this would grant you and extract even more power from the sword fused to yourself, in which case it can still potentially harm you.

Finally, this grants you a form of quick regeneration, letting you recover quite fast from heavy wounds, and it may even let you reattach something as a cut head if you do it quickly enough with your incredible speed."
