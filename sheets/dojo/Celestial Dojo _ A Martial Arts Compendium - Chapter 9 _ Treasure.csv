2,Free,Basic Cultivation Scroll,A Will Eternal,Treasure,"A very basic scroll detailing some introductory methods of cultivation, and use of spiritual
and vital energy. While not specific in its teachings, meaning that you will not progress
terribly far with it, it is also a clean slate, meaning that those that follow it will not have their
future cultivation influenced in any specific direction. This is a good method for providing the
foundation for future cultivation while encouraging the cultivator to think of their own future
path."

and fuss of taking up space or weighing down transport. Taking the form of a small bag, or

overall a bit faster, relaxed, perky and drunk. Perhaps for pre-fight sips. No substitute for real sleep."
10,50,A Storied Blade,Generic Exalted,Treasure,"You receive an average Daiklave, roughly a '2 dot' artifact
weapon, for free. It comes in the magical material of your choice. Daiklaves are swords that are
really huge because screw you physics huge swords are cool. For an extra 50cp you can
upgrade it to a Grand Daiklave which is basically a super-huge greatsword. If you're thinking of
a massive eight foot long slab of metal heavier than two fully grown men then you're on the right
track. Unlike regular artifact weapons that you would normally find ones purchased here have
no Essence requirement. You can attune to them, and keep them attuned, for absolutely free.
Additionally, also unlike normal magical weapons (of this low a level at least) these Daiklaves
are completely indestructible. Comes with 1 hearthstone socket, just because"

It now gains you Cloth’s level of durability if it didn’t already have, and most importantly the ability to amplify the cosmo you burn while wearing it, to the same extent of the Cloth’s grade.

While no magical items are contained within the room, there is almost no limit to the variety of gorgeous treasures and accessories that can be found within. Also, no one can see inside the room to see if you’ve decided to have a swim through your literal hills and valleys of gold."
18,100,Helm of Obscurity,Saint Seiya Episode G,Treasure,"While most of the Saints do not cover their faces in or out of combat, you’ve taken to be an exception to this.

advance in the Dao."
21,100,Extravagant Dressing: A Suit for the Devil,Avesta of Black and White,Treasure,"The Dagravant are known for being quite eccentric and unique, and that also reflects on their clothing.

22,100,A Shining Weapon: Starter Kit,Avesta of Black and White,Treasure,"You have gained a weapon. A sword, a mace or even a pair of guns. It doesn’t really matter what kind of weapon do you pick, as neither of these weapons are especially potent, but as weapons crafted in Wahman Yast, they will serve well enough in fighting most Daeva."
23,100,All The King’s Horses,Campione,Treasure,"A godly being like you deserves a godly steed to travel, and while you may possess an Authority to do so already, another item may prove useful in some cases. For that, this legendary mount is yours to use. Able to break the speed of sound easily while protecting all passengers and possessing a small but effective amount of firepower to defend you when you need it. The exact aesthetic depends on you, maybe you want a flying horse or a small dragon or a vimana. Regardless, the specs will be the same."

This is a large library is a collection of myths, legends, fables and records about gods, angels, demons, heroes and other fantastical beings.

27,100,Asauchi,Bleach,Treasure,"A single blank sword, apparently one of the only Zanpakuto not created by Nimaiya and thus not
subject to his knowledge. In all other respects, this is a perfectly functioning blank sword. Any non- Shinigami who spends enough time with this blade, continually infusing it with their energy, will be able to awaken it as their own Zanpakuto. For 300CP instead, a supply of these Asauchi can be
gained. There will be eight blank swords in total, along with a further eight swords every five years. Shinigami who purchase this should be aware that it is impossible to awaken a second Zanpakuto from an Asauchi state with one already part of their soul. Though a second Zanpakuto itself is not
impossible. "
28,100,Arrancar Uniform,Bleach,Treasure,"An all white uniform of some mysterious make worn by every Arrancar. Who makes such outfits and
what they’re made of is enigmatic, as is why they seem to expand and contort with their wearer. This uniform, even as you transform using Resurreccion or some other ability or form, will
automatically reshape itself to remain form fitting. It can even change style if that would better
emphasize the abilities or aesthetics of that form. "
29,100,Slaughter Demon,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"A wide-bladed dagger, shaped almost like a cross between a butcher’s cleaver and a combat knife, with a wooden handle and a guard of black fur. A basic cursed tool, Slaughter Demon does little more than act as a weapon capable of harming cursed spirits, even in the hands of a non-sorcerer. It won’t be of too much use against a powerful curse, but against an average or weaker one? It’ll slice or stab through them with ease."
30,100,Tsukamoto,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"A small cursed corpse, taking the form of a small stuffed doll bear with boxing gloves on its paws and a rather ugly face. Its main purpose is to help sorcerers learn how to use cursed energy. As long as it is supplied with a constant, steady stream of cursed energy, it will remain asleep, snoring peacefully. The moment that flow is interrupted, be it by giving it too much or too little, it will awaken and start punching those closest to it until it receives energy once again. The punches definitely hurt, but they aren’t strong enough to seriously injure anyone. Usually, it’s set to only require a low amount of cursed energy at first but will gradually increase its demand, training the user to maintain a higher output."
31,100,Cough Syrup,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"An item any user of Cursed Speech would love to have. This is a bottle of generic brand cough syrup that never seems to run out of its medicine. As one might expect it doesn’t taste the best, but its utility is undeniable: any sort of sore or irritated throat is cleared up in an instant, leaving the user feeling as good as new.

Uchiha clan, has the objective of passing a message and information to those that
you want in the future. You can write any kind of information on it, being invisible to
those without some specific ability or if some technique of your choice isn’t used to
reveal it. Just the usage of some godlike detection ability would be able to discover
what is written on this tablet without the usage of your chosen ability/technique."
34,100,Box of Chakra Pills,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Treasure,"You receive a fiat-backed small box, containing ten
chakra-filled pills, equal to those created using the Chakra Edible Creation perk.

one of them having around the same chakra reserves of the average jōnin. You can
summon this box at will and it’ll be restocked monthly. If lost or destroyed, the box
will reappear in your Warehouse in the next month."
35,100,Divine Gourd,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Treasure,"At the first impression, this glowing gourd made of red
chakra looks like any other chakra construct, but there are some important
differences. Unlike the other constructs, this gourd is permanent and doesn’t require
any extra energy to stay existing. Its main function is to store energy and techniques
to use later and even replicate them using your own power after absorbing them for
the first time. The gourd doesn’t have unlimited storage, capable of storing up to
energy equivalent to the power of the One-Tail, and will break if its energy limit is
surpassed, making all of the stored energy and techniques to be released in a very
dangerous way. If lost or destroyed, the gourd will reappear in your Warehouse in the
next year, but, if you have the Chakra Construct perk, you’ll be able to repair it
using your own chakra if it’s destroyed.

Requires Ōtsutsuki to purchase."
36,100,Silver Armaments,Ragna Crimson,Treasure,"Unlike regular Dragon Hunters, the weapons of the Silver Corps are a bit less standardized. Ranging from silver infused fists to guns that use silver ammunition, you have gained one of these items crafted by the Silver Princess herself."
37,100,A Silver Sword,Ragna Crimson,Treasure,"You wouldn’t be able to be a Dragon Hunter without one of these: a high-quality silver sword, probably crafted by one of the big figures of the time seeing its general quality and design. This kind of sword is good enough that it won’t break when making contact with a Seija, but unlike the weapons that Ragna makes, it’s not good enough to easily kill them."
38,100,Sudarshan Chakra Yamaraj,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Treasure,"Now here’s a real weapon, a worthy force for any heroic figure. A massive chakram, bigger than a
grown man and made of impossible heavy metal that allows it to crash through even enchanted
steel with ease. Despite this mass, it feels light as a feather to your touch and as easy to manipulate
as your own limbs. The chakram spins at incredible speeds with a twitch of your wrist, allowing the
blades that sprout from it’s rim to cut through most material. When spinning like this it can even be
unleashed to roll towards enemies at high speeds, homing in and returning to you via magic. The
final aspect to this divine weapon is the holy fire that can be summoned from it. Never harming you
but growing in size and intensity the faster the blade spins, it creates a combination tool that crushes, cuts and burns through all enemies that stand before it. "
39,100,Agni Gandiva,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Treasure,"A gift from the God of Fire, this ornate bow forbids the hands of any human but it’s chosen wielder
to lift it or draw back it’s string. Taking the same form as the favoured weapon of Arjuna himself, the
bow will grant great force to any arrow loosed through it and is capable of wreathing these shots in
heavenly flames. A mortal man could shoot through thick castle walls and unleash fireballs that melt
down dozens of men at the target point but it will only give greater results when wielded by one
with already great strength or abilities relating to fire. Arrows will form at the side of the bow if none
are given by the holder, pure fire solidifying into an arrow for your use. "
40,100,Lord of Lions,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Treasure,"A stable fit for any emperor, particularly the ones with a Christian problem. A dozen enormous lions
lounge around you now, each a loyal and loving pet that just can’t get enough cuddles from you. They’re big enough for an adult to easily ride and strong enough to tear a armoured soldier in half
with a paw slap. They’re great for keeping you warm and well trained at guarding people and places, plus they make you seem a lot more kingly when you have one of them near you. "
41,100,Stymphalian Birds,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Treasure,"A quiver full of bronze arrows, which seemingly never runs dry. When shot into the sky from a bow, each arrow will transform into one of Ares’ Stymphalian birds, each one the size of a vulture, with a
body made of hard bronze and hostility towards any of your enemies. They are not very dangerous
on their own, save to ordinary mortals, but hundreds of arrows can be short into the sky to create
large swarms of the creatures."
42,100,Flying Sword,Cradle,Treasure,"It doesn't just have to be a sword. This weapon can be any basic
weapon you like, but it's controlled by your will and can fly with enough strength to act as a
hoverboard if you so desire. It's got a range limitation of about 20 feet, but you don't have to
worry about it falling out of your control."
43,100,Faithful Bane,One finger Death Punch,Treasure,"You have a simple weapon that you are never without. This is limited to traditional martial arts

replacement will be dropped from the sky. You may import a weapon to gain these properties."
44,100,Ruin Turning Cape,One finger Death Punch,Treasure,"It’s more of a sash, really. Woven with rich saffron and scarlet, wearing it protects you from one
backstab each stage or similar combat encounter, moving on its own to block any unseen attacks."
45,100,Woe Blocking Bracers,One finger Death Punch,Treasure,"A pair of limb encasing guards, forged with flexible metals and inscribed with protective mantras.
They block unavoidable front blows once a stage or similar encounter by moving to intercept."
46,100,A Magnificent Armor,Generic Exalted,Treasure,"You've come into possession of a set of magical armor. Pick any
type of regular armor, even armored clothing/coats. You now have a set of such armor that has
been enhanced with a magical material of your choice. These require no Essence to attune and
are dramatically more effective at protecting you than regular armor. The armor, if damaged, will
repair itself given time, is also self cleaning, and keeps you quite comfortable and temperature
controlled. Magical clothing will be the equivalent of regular full plate but completely and totally
subtle, whereas magical full plate will be comparably even better than normal full plate if rather
obvious about it. Comes with one, discrete, hearthstone socket just because."
47,100,Tormented Instruments of Slaughter,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"What is a knight without their weapons and armor? Here you will be able to acquire a fine
collection of weaponry and sets of armor. None amongst this collection are artifacts, for the
souls of the dead that make up the metal were not alloyed with Labyrinth ores, but they are
strong as mortal steel and forged into martial implements of exceptional quality. Sizeable
enough to fill an armory, you’ll find this collection has weapons for every martial pursuit you
might aspire towards, and suits of armor in whatever styles you wish, from light chain shirts
and reinforced jackets, to great superheavy plates."
48,100,Ashen Regalia of Death’s Lawgivers,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"It wouldn’t do for the Chosen of Death to dress in mortal clothes, so instead you will receive
a wardrobe more fitting to your station. An outfit for each of the four hundred and twenty
days of the year, and especially ornate garb for the five days of Calibration.
Your choices of apparel include such highlights as white funerary robes, victorian era black
with bone-corsets, Contagion-era plague doctor uniforms, mummy wrappings, a ""outfit""
composed mostly of chains to barely cover anything, as the Lady of Darkness in
Bloodstained Robes wears, and whatever else you would like as long as it is properly gothic
or evocative of death and the Underworld But no matter what deathly attires and Underworld
accessories you choose to take from your closets, these sets of attire will always be
comfortable and bespoke, and in the case of the more risque choices of ""garb"", they will

somehow manage to cover you in a flattering way, or expose you in captivating fashion,
depending on your whims."
49,100,Assemblage of Blight and Medicament,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"The shadowed lands of the Underworld produce countless drugs and toxins, some deadlier
than others, some more enjoyable than others. From the Bayou of Endless Regret alone
come a thousand bizarre drugs and dire toxins, some of which can kill even Fair Folk, ghosts
and demons. There is deadly venom harvested from plasmic arrow frogs, soporific toxins to
be placed on needles or in cups of ghostly wine, and steel ant venom that burns both the
living and the dead.
Most terrifying to ghosts is Lethe serpent venom, at once the most feared toxin in the
Underworld, and perhaps the kindliest way to ""kill"" a ghost. Lethe serpent venom does not
damage its victims corpus or body. Instead, if they fail to resist the venom, a ghost instantly
enters Lethe to be reincarnated, though on rare occasions the unluckiest of wraiths find their
soul send to Oblivion instead. The living affected by it instead suffer a month of amnesia,
losing none of their skill but forgetting their identity.
These and many more toxins and drugs are at your disposal now, an eclectic collection of
hundreds of different substances at your disposal. Replenishing once used, and carefully
catalogued for your use, each of these drugs comes in a separate container. With this, you
will never again lack an appropriate venom... nor a dose of wraithly cocaine."
50,200,Gravity Blade,UQ Holder,Treasure,"A creation by the legendary, and infamous in some circles, Albireo Imma. This black katana has a small dial on the handle that allows the wielder to instantly alter the weight of the blade. It can be altered up to x50,000 times in either direction through the use of gravity magic. At that maximum setting, it’s about 40 tonnes of sword in that little package. By rapidly increasing and decreasing the weight, you can create a particularly destructive and effective fighting style with the sword. Might take some time to get used to using it however. The sword also possesses a mind of its own, though it mostly keeps quiet until spoken to."
51,200,Sacred Animal parts,Cradle V1,Treasure,"You gain a treasure chest full of remnants and sacred beasts inside capsules. The higher you advance, the more will fill the chest. You may harvest any part from them without harming them, simply copying the part, as if you had killed them and harvested it. because you bought this with cp, none of the remnants will corrupt you or your path, giving you all the benefits, and none of the negatives. You can still only bind one remnant safely, so choose wisely."

53,200,Skysworn armor,Cradle V1,Treasure,"This armor comes with some awesome features. A dream construct that can send long range messages like a radio, a thousand-mile cloud in the compartment on the back, triggerable defensive wind barriers, passive defenses in the form of scripts that weakened hostile madra and spiritual attacks, and a long list of additional options that can be added by Soulsmiths. This baby does it all, except defend against attacks that can affect the spiritual and physical world at the same time."

Once a year, you gain a cache of elixirs and pills that will be incredibly potent and can help you advance whenever you need it. These are the highest quality and will update in other worlds to be made of the most beneficial materials. Think meat from 1000-year-old dragons, and lettuce that been frozen in an iceberg for a million years."
57,200,Evolve Armour,Saint Seiya Omega,Treasure,"It seems that your armor form has evolved and reverted to its previous state.
Now, your cloth creates a physical statue representing the theme of the armor
you possess, which must be carried around in a huge cloth box. Despite this

you had before, but is at least three times more potent than before."

But there’s nothing that really matches the majesty of a divine chariot like the one you own. You have a nigh unbreakable chariot pulled by 4 divine animals of your choice, so long as you don’t get too crazy and ask for something like a quad of dragons. The divine beasts are able to pull your chariot through the air or on the ground at the speed of light with ease. A relatively slow pace for an awakened god but still enough to get you to most places in comfort. You may import a chariot into this option."
60,200,Mortal Weapon,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Treasure,"The Weapons of the vast expanse of the primordial Chaos are
divided into various ranks, the very first being the Mortal Rank. Despite being the weakest ranked

sound and take thousand pound boulders to the face. And you are now in possession of such a
weapon."

63,200,Magical Weapon,Campione,Treasure,"All Knights are given their own weapons after they reach a certain level, sometimes they are forged and other times these are simply passed down from another knight. While these are usually swords, it's far from the norm and it means little when any adept knight can use magic to change the shape of their weapons.

It was with this weapon that Ashhart was eventually killed by Wujin. Well balanced, extremely sharp, and impossibly durable, this sword really lives up to its name. It was even able to survive the desolation of the Eternal Twilight unscathed. Somehow or other, you have managed to get your hands on your own version of this sword. If you wish, this weapon doesn’t have to be a sword. It could be some other kind of bladed weapon, such as a spear or halberd."

coat with a cowl and multiple white ties to keep it secure. Infused with Kido, the cloak allows the
wearer to almost completely conceal not only themselves, but their spirit energy. Only extremely
refined of senses could pick them up, the wearer practically blending in with the air around them. The effects tend to dull when the wearer exerts their spiritual power beyond their body, but until
that point you should be able to sneak around even some of the stronger or more refined enemies
you’re likely to encounter here."
67,200,Flying Devices,Bleach,Treasure,"In the human world, which has little to no ambient spirit energy in the atmosphere, Shinigami and
other Spirit Beings are able to diffuse their own spirit energy into the air in order to stand or fly. This
same task becomes impossible in places with with spirit energy, such as Hueco Mundo or Soul
Society. To give you an edge over others in places like these, we bestow you with two devices that
enable flight. The first is a long wand of bone and some other material; by channeling their spirit
energy into the wand, a tentacle will wrap around the user’s arm, while a series of bony protrusions
will stretch outwards and form a wing. The second is a brown mantle displaying the Shihoin Clan
Crest, which is as easy to use as slinging it over your shoulders. While the wand allows for speedy
flight but takes up one’s hand while in use, the mantle allows for sustained floating and causes no
real impairment. Neither are very hard to use at all, with even beginners being able to use them with
ease. "
68,200,Hojiku-Zai,Bleach,Treasure,"A limited production drug developed by Mayuri Kurotsuchi, and normally kept for his personal use. The Hojiku-Zai, also known as Flesh-Healing Medicine, is presented as a green fluid sloshing around
in a syringe. When administered, it will cause rapid regeneration of the recipients body parts, able to
quickly mend large wounds or even entire missing limbs. Not quite so effective with vital organs, but
then most wouldn’t survive long enough for it to be administered anyway. There is the unfortunate
side effect of intense pain while the drug is in effect, but I’m sure you can grit through that in return
for a lost arm, right? You receive three vials per day, with the contents usually being expended after
one use. "
69,200,Ancestral Zanpakuto,Bleach,Treasure,"Not all Zanpakuto are personal tools, made from the soul of one Shinigami. Some are the result of an
entire family line, each holding and passing down a mighty weapon. Rather than an ordinary weapon, you possess one of these ancestral tools instead. For some reason, possessing this Zanpakuto doesn't prevent you from wielding your own Asauchi. The ancestral Zanpakuto
is set in it’s ways, with already established powers independent of your own. While this means they
will not grow with you further through power or maturation, it also means that every ancestral
weapon is already mighty. They possess incredible and often numerous abilities as a result. A mirror
blade that perfectly scatters, reflects and even destroys those said to be ‘gods’ is one example. Another is a sword with the ability to copy and manifest the abilities of any Zanpakuto the wielder
has seen, scaling these individual powers to the user’s own level of Reiryoku. These are only
examples of their Shikai, as well. The downsides are that they usually entail a cost or significant threat to the wielder as a result of this
power. The mirror blade, Shinken Hakkyoken, can result in the wielder’s destruction if they don’t have the strength to hold it against the reflected attacks. The copy sword, Enrakyoten, drains from
the life force of the user to mimic other Zanpakuto. Perhaps some of these downsides can be
countered with skill or enough power but for now, they remain in tact. Other than their inability to grow with you, they work as normal for Zanpakuto. You may apply the
below options to them, they possess a Spirit, a Shikai and Bankai, as well as the other limitations of a
soul sword. If desired, you can also pass the sword on to a descendant. False Release- 100"
70,200,Loyal Stead ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Treasure,"This animal, by default a Horse, is a companion unlike any other. You two will be so close it will be as if it was part of you. In fact if you can’t walk on your own feet, this Stead may support you in the fight. Like the Legendary Red Hare this animal is capable of riding 1,000 miles within a day and is unyieldingly loyal to you. It will follow you even into the afterlife and into death and is tough enough to endure the result of Thor and Lu Bus attacks meeting. You may Import a Animal you have into this."
71,200,Bottomless Pouch,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Treasure,"This special pouch is quite useful thing for any cunning combatants who know show to use it. In it is a endless amount of space where anything you put in can be stored to be resummoned by simply thinking about what it is you need. Not truly everything can be in here however, as a human must be able to hold it in your hand comfortably. Still a limitless amount of knives, piano wire or other such nifty tools could be stored here and taken when you need it most."
72,200,Hidden Inventory,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"A weak cursed spirit bound to you, in the form of a purple, worm-like creature long enough to coil around your body with a hideous, vaguely human-like face. It doesn’t have any offensive ability whatsoever, but is instead used to store objects. The interior of its body is far larger than its size might imply: blades, tools, and swarms of small cursed spirits can be stored inside of it, seemingly without limit. Just by pushing it into its mouth, anything that fits could be stowed inside of it, and anything inside can be withdrawn just by reaching inside and thinking of what you want.

Interestingly, the cursed spirit is also capable of swallowing its own body, allowing it to shrink down small enough to be effortlessly swallowed by someone else. Anything stored inside of its body is undetectable from the outside, and nothing can subvert its allegiance to you."
73,200,Special Grade Cursed Tool(200),Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"By purchasing this option, you receive a cursed tool imbued with one of the abilities from the cursed technique section, allowing you to wield it through this item. The exact form of your cursed tool, as well as how it specifically interacts with the cursed technique it carries, is up to you. Perhaps you have a megaphone that allows you to use Cursed Speech when talking through it, a shamisen imbued with Boogie Woogie that switches people’s places when played, or a sword that slowly leaks blood that its wielder can control as if by Blood Manipulation. As long as its effects are related to the original technique – and don’t exceed it in power or ignore its limitations – it should be possible.

The price for such an object is equal to the original cost of the cursed technique.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
74,200,Chain of a Thousand Miles,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"A special grade cursed tool in the form of a metal chain with a clip at one end. So long as the end without the clip remains hidden from anyone’s view, the chain can keep extending with no known limit, though it can also be shortened by retracting the chain as well. While it can be used as a weapon by itself, the clip allows for other objects, including cursed tools, to be very easily attached to it, greatly extending their range."
75,200,Nanatsu Yoru,Tsukihime,Treasure,"It gleams so nicely in the moonlight, doesn’t it? A simple knife that has a simple inscription on it: “Seven Nights” in Japanese. Its blade is far sharper than any mundane blade, and nobody seems to realize it's a weapon until you start actively trying to use it - and that gives you the lovely opportunity to slide it between their ribs."
76,200,Black Keys ,Tsukihime,Treasure,"Short swords designed to be thrown, these Conceptual Weapons are effective against spiritual entities. By striking an opponent's shadow you can bind their movements; and it's significantly more difficult to remove them by hand when this is utilized, giving you the chance to strike at them. A Church Executioner with Iron Plate Effect receives this for free."
77,200,Such Expensive Tastes,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"Certain Charyeok require regular treats to keep them happy and motivated. Certain humans too. It gets a bit expensive indulging your partners and loved ones over and over though, so this suitcase might help take that load off. A simple black leather case, what’s inside is where the value is. As you open the case, you’ll be able to think of any piece of mundane jewellery you’ve got your eye or a friend’s eye on. Once you fully open the case, it’ll be right there waiting for you. You’re even able to make multiple copies. Problem is, the more expensive the gift you ask for, the longer it’ll take before the brief case works again. Just want a gold bar or two? The case will be good to go in an hour or two. Wanting an enormous ruby and sapphire encrusted necklace of pure diamond, platinum and gold? Might take a good few months before you get another use."
78,200,Weighted Clothing,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"A classic staple of martial artists everywhere, at least in some realities. You’ve got a set weight clothes, coming in a full set from cloak and shirt to socks and shoes and everything in between. The more you wear at once, the heavier you’ll find it weighs upon you. Putting everything on at once will leave you barely able to crawl, at least until you work that weight off. It’ll never get outdated either, as soon as you are able to comfortably wear the full set of clothing without much trouble, it’ll increase its burden until you’re back to crawling and need to work your way back up again. Won’t make for great fashion either but at least you’ll spend a lot less on weights."
79,200,Aegis Shield,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,The spirit of the legendary Aegis carried by Athena and Zeus. This Charyeok manifests as a full body energy armour made of transparent energy shards. These shads can split up and move as the user wills. They can be used to attack as a swarm of flying energy knives or form into singular weapons for the user to wield or to enhance the user’s existing weapons. They can also be formed into larger weapons on their own and fight independently of the user or form shields or platforms to defend or stand on.
80,200,Adam and Eve,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"A pair of holy pistols. The ammunition for these two guns is reliant on the life energy of the user, which is turned into Silver Bullets as the two guns fire. Silver Bullets do significantly increased damage to any God or Demon that is struck by them, then the energy bullets would normally do."
81,200,Bong Seon,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"A mystical long sword passed down through the family of one Yu Mi-Ra for generations. It has no unique abilities of its own, simply the innate traits of a National Treasure and a terrifyingly sharp edge."
82,200,Tiny Dragon’s Nunchuks,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"The Tiny Dragon’s Nunchuks take the form of a basic black coloured Nunchaku. A simple Treasure, they are able to change between two alternate forms as the user wills it. A long black spear combining the two Nunchuks, named Large Dragon Spear, or a pair of Tonfas named Bruce and Lee."
83,200,Palace of the Dragon King,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Treasure,"Following the clan’s rules, an Ōtsutsuki is
prohibited from killing a fellow clan member, unless in special situations, even if they
aren’t a pure Ōtsutsuki, so, when a clan member break the rules, the Palace of the
Dragon King is usually the option used to make them pay for this. This black box can
release a gaseous substance to its target, causing their entire body to petrify and
become frozen in time. This effect lasts for ten thousand years and the victim will be
preserved alive during all of this time. It’s possible for others with time manipulation
abilities to try to stop the time freeze, but this is a hard task. If you ever freeze
yourself in time somehow, the time you spent frozen won’t count for the time that you
need to stay in the setting. You receive one of these black boxes and, if used, lost or
destroyed, you’ll gain a new one at the start of each Jump.

Requires Ōtsutsuki to purchase."
84,200,Black Keys,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Treasure,"A favoured weapon of Holy Man, used by choice for devoted adherents only. Taking the form of long and slender rapier-like swords, the blade measuring over one meter with extremely short hilts, their true nature is much more sacred. They are weaponized sacraments of the Holy Church, created with the lament for the dead as their base. Designed to be thrown instead of being used as a melee weapon, the Black Keys are akin to anti-heresy poison, making it very effective against Dead Apostles, Vampires and undead. You can summon a nigh infinite amount of these sacraments from your person, using them with expertise instinctually like the most dedicated of Executors."
85,200,Diatrekhōn Astēr Lonkhē,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Treasure,"Straightforward is sometimes the best way to go. Rather than rely on special capabilities that form
the core of a fighting style, the best course of action is to have a reliable weapon that enhances what
you can do even without it. The spear of Achilles does just that. A very well made weapon, with a
sharp and sturdy design, with high capability for use as a spear and a throwing javelin. It has two
magical abilities. The first is that the wounds created by the spear cannot be healed without very
powerful magic, so long as the spear exists. Similar to the red spear of the later Irish hero Diarmuid, the wounds this weapon makes become part of the normal state of any victim. 

The second ability is to create a bounded field for dueling. A battleground is created where it
becomes impossible for gods, outside help or luck of any kind to interfere in the battle between the
two combatants. This created battleground is a separate dimension, divided in space and time from
the outside world, ensuring any duel lasts just a brief moment to outside view. The rules of the duel
are decided on by both combatants together, but enforced fully on agreement, and the battleground
can only be summoned provided both agree with full knowledge of the details of this ability. Only
once one of the two are defeated can the field be escaped. "
86,200,Harpe,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Treasure,"Strangely shaped it may be, this scythe like sword is still a legendary weapon. Harpe is a powerful
magical sword with a inward curving blade, resembling a scythe or hook at the end, with an edge on
the inner curve. Supernaturally sharp as any magical blade is, the special power of this weapon is the
Refraction of Longevity, a divine attribute that allows it to deal wounds to any ‘immortal’ beings and
make it impossible to recover from with any means but natural processes. Regardless of the power
of the magic used, the wounds Harpe inflicts will not close up until and unless they naturally would. Needless to say, Harpe being used for killing blows ensures that the vast majority of immortals will
stay dead once made dead."
87,200,Vishnu Baja,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Treasure,"The great gallery of weapons that the hero Rama was granted by the Sage Vishwamitra. Stored in a
dimensional pocket connecting to your being, you have access to dozens of powerful divine weapons
with a variety of magical effects, mostly focused on anti-divine and anti-demon combat. They’re easy
to wield for you, feeling natural in your hands, and this only improves the greater your divinity
becomes. Those with the blood of a demigod could easily wield multiple of these weapons at once, floating through the air around you as if through telekinesis. A full god could bring out even greater
power from each weapon and potentially have the two dozen or more tools all attacking at once!
While there are many legendary weapons held within, some appear as inferior copies, such as the
tools of Shiva himself. Vishnu Baja contains powerful tools but individually they would be more along
the power held by the Agni Gandiva or Sudarshan Chakra. "
88,200,Vasavi Shakti,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Treasure,"The spear to slay gods, the one shot weapon of the Thunder God that has the legend of destroying
whatever it is used against. This enormous weapon, longer than a full grown man, is an exceptionally
capable tool to slay Gods. The spear itself is more than capable of slicing and piercing most targets
but becomes many times more powerful when faced against anything with Divinity, able to strike at
the very core of such beings and deal wounds despite their protections. But when a vast amount of
magical energy is forced into the spear, enough that a powerful demigod would feel exhausted from
it, Vasavi Shakti awakens to it’s true form. Shattering the thick restraints on the spear, an ungodly
fire is released in all directions, enough to vaporise the land for miles around. Just a side effect of the
power, the spear’s tip will unleash a ray of light capable of killing even the most powerful Divine
Spirits of the land if struck. This ray tears through all things, even magical concepts such as bounded
fields are erased by the power. With even more energy, the power could grow greater and greater. Once used, the spear will slumber in order to repair the damage it sustains from activation, unlikely
to answer your call for a day."
89,200,Boneless Man,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Treasure,"A double-edged spear with a long blade, this appears to be quite a sturdy weapon. A button found
on the haft will open the head, splitting it into a cross guard and revealing a smaller blade at the end
of the spear, which can be a brutal finisher if the spear head happens to be impaled in someone
when you split it. But the Boneless Man earns it’s name not for being a trick weapon but for how it
cuts through men. Before the edge of this weapon, it’s targets are cut through as if they had no
bones. Swinging the spear head through a man would be like cutting through a bag of meat and
blood, treating the bones as if they were air to cut through. The defence nullification of the spear
extends to any similar skeletal form, removing the defensive properties of internal structure that
could be compared to bones."
90,200,Boudica’s Sword,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Treasure,"A sword that holds no promises of victory, yet remains both holy and strong regardless. Once
wielded by the rebellious queen Boudica, the straightforward blade has practical uses. It’s edge is
potent enough to cut even the best Roman armor easily and with only a slight amount of energy, it
can fire quick blasts of magic across a distance, even at a very high rate of fire. These blasts won’t
knock down castle walls but they can certainly tear men or horses in half with each shot. Calling on
Boudica and the glories of the blade can let you charge these blasts together, pouring more magic in
to create a much stronger attack. The more energy you give, the larger and more intense the blast
will become."
91,200,Yew Bow,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Treasure,"A crossbow crafted by the hands of one of the many who took up the Robin Hood mantle. Made
from the yew tree, each shot from this bow contains a terrible poison, which can weaken and harm
even a heroic spirit or powerful demon, with normal humans falling in moments from it’s effects. The arrows appear to the wielders hand when needed, allowing for quick loading for the bow that
can optionally fire at quite the rapid speed.

With a brief surge of energy and calling the crossbow’s name out, a variety of magical effects can be
utilised. The first and most lethal is that anything the next bolt fired touches, will see any impurities, diseases or poison in their bodies instantaneously amplified. Only a touch is required as well, making
defence difficult as the bolts do not need to pierce the enemy. The effect of this can range from
merely intensifying the existing effects and duration to creating an explosion like lightning up
gunpowder within their body. Alternatively, the same calling of the name can cause the next arrow
to create an area around where it lands that automatically transfers a weaker dose of the Yew
poison, strengthening as long as they remain within. 

Finally, through expending magical energy, the Yew Bow can create trees under the user’s command
that originate from Sherwood Forest. These can appear as roots that swarm and bind targets, originating from bolts shot by the bow, or as trees that appear and shape themselves to the
wielder’s wish from around their body."
92,200,Nether Divine Armor,Gourmet Of Another World,Treasure,"An ability possessed by the powerhouses of the Netherworld is the ability to generate a set of armor made from their energy. This armor is capable of easily resisting attacks from beings of an equal level and can greatly enhance the user's fighting prowess. The only restriction is that the armor will steadily drain the user's energy. This can be dealt with by training however, allowing you to lower the consumption and to increase your endurance. Lastly is a unique aspect. When the user is on the brink of death they can solidify this armor into a piece of equipment. Since you’re paying with CP you may instead do this by temporarily sacrificing the ability to use this power. It will take a few weeks to a few months to regain your armor. "
93,200,Sky Overlord’s Ancient Profound Ark,Against The Gods,Treasure,"An airship by any other name. This is a Profound
Ark of the highest quality and finest make, something crafted not by mortals but by Divine Way
practitioners in a bygone age. It has a vast inner space, easily in multiple square miles, give or take,
and moves extremely fast, covering thousands of miles an hour.
While it doesn’t exactly require any fuel, it goes faster the more energy you pour in, and will accept
any form of power or power generation you can provide. Being a creation of the Ancient times, it
can even go into space, the inside magically taking care of any atmospheric requirements."
94,200,Ore Load,Cradle,Treasure,"Halfsilver, Goldsteel, Wintersteel, and more, you've got a replenishing
supply of all the exotic metals on Cradle, though those three are the most prominent. There's
about 10 pounds of each material, refreshing each week."
95,200,Diamond Veins,Cradle,Treasure,"An artifact that takes the appearance of a gemstone. When absorbed
into your Core and spread throughout your Madra Channels, it reinforces them, allowing you to
handle much greater power at once without straining yourself. For you, this also applies to any
other magical power you have that would normally tax you physically or mentally."
96,200,Path Manual,Cradle,Treasure,"The written instructions for any one of the Paths shown in Cradle,
including White Fox, Heaven's Glory, Stellar Spear, Blackflame, Hollow King, Twin Stars, and so
on. For an additional 200 CP, this becomes a Library of Paths that includes every single Canon
Path."
97,200,Gauntlets of Enlightened Fury,Infernals Exalted,Treasure,"Angering one who walks the path of the Infernal Monster is unwise. Yet that style's
characteristic berserking anger is sometimes... less than desired. For that reason, these
ornate gauntlets were created. Forged out of green iron, bound in Brass with decorative
patterning along the knuckles, baptized in the blood of several seasoned second circle
generals, and holding powerful blessings of both Madelrada and Kashta...
They bestow upon their wearers an enlightened, cold fury, ensuring that when they go into a
berserker state gained from infernal monster they will actually become more powerful as a
result. The anger and fury of the style will merge seamlessly with the cunning and rational
thought the wearer possesses without the charm, to form something closer to the Yozis
particular sense of spiteful hatred. The wearer will still rampage and slaughter, but now it will
a calculated and precise effort instead of the random destruction the Infernal Monster
embodies naturally."
98,200,Spine of Isidoros,Infernals Exalted,Treasure,"This heavy Vajra of ebon material bears more resemblance to a harpoon than any ordinary
javelin, bladed and barbed as it is. When first confronted with it, an observer unfamiliar with it
might assume that it was forged of some dense malfean metal. It is only when it is thrown by
its attuned wielder that its true nature becomes obvious.
For as it sails through the air it only speeds up further never slowing before it finds it mark,
and even appears to pull those things that it passes into its slipstream. Stone and sea twist
like taffy as it flies by, though they usually snap back into place once it has passed. When it
does impact upon its target, it will deliver a force so terrible that it belies even the great size
and weight it is already seen to posses. Such is the might of The Black Boar That Twists the
Skies, that even a single bristle from his hide would become a mighty artifact when willingly
relinquished and bathed in Vitriol for so a time that lesser materials would have long since
crumbled to dust."
99,200,Blood-Thirsting Chains of the Rantai’s Razors,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"Every link of this artifact fighting chain is a barbed loop of bone, each of which has been
magically reinforced to possess durability comparable to the magical materials. With wicked
soulsteel hooks on the ends of the chain, forged of souls tortured with the chain’s barbs
during its construction, it writhes and squirms with malevolent instinct in the hands of its
wielder. The chains are eager to taste blood again, whether from a ghostly corpus or from
the veins of the living. Accordingly, the barbs on the chain dig deep into your enemies,
causing bloody and nasty wounds as it hungrily grabs onto your victims.
Should a ghost be caught on its barbs, the spirits’ agony will be unending, as they are
caught onto these bones hooks. One so trapped can only be released through the will of the
chains’ master, or the actions of another, who must tear them off the chains with agonizing
violence. A ghost so leashed can be compelled to serve the wielder of the chains, forcing
them into painful obedience while ensnared."
100,300,Warrior Of The Gods,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Treasure,"A warrior of the Gods does not charge into battle without the right weapons or armor. The
mainstay of this world are the many divine armors that the Gods grant to their loyal warriors -
The Cloths of Athena, the Scales of Poseidon, and the Surplices of Hades. They act as
amplifiers to the combat ability and Cosmo of the wearer, along them to attack with greater
power and take more damage. However, these items do not inherently make the user
superhuman - you must burn Cosmo equal to the necessary level of the armor. It does not add
to your power, it merely complements it. Thus, someone who wears an armor expecting it to win
the battle for them will merely be weighed down by several cumbersome pounds (or tons).
The armor usually takes the form of a statue based off of a single creature or item, which then
breaks apart into smaller pieces that cover the user and fit to them like a glove.                                                                                           This armor is
stored within a metal box marking what ‘type’ of armor is contained within when it is not in use.
While you will need to either carry it or need someone to do so for you during your stay here,
post-jump you may summon this box and your armor at any time you wish from the Warehouse.
You will receive an armor equivalent to those of the Bronze Cloth. It will be either of your own design, or an existing Cloths, Scales and Surplices. 
.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       You can upgrade it to the equivalent of Silver or Gold Cloths by
spending extra points below or simply by growing stronger. Do note that you are not necessarily crippled by choosing a
‘weaker’ armor - as said, it mainly amplifies the Cosmo you burn, and stronger armors have a
stronger starting requirement. And the Bronze Saints may yet overcome even the Gold Saints
through awakening greater Cosmo and smarter fighting abilities. Should you have a piece of
armor you’re particularly attached to, you may import that as your armor for 100 points.
Depending on your chosen background, your armor will have some innate properties..."
101,300,Bronze Grade Cloth,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Treasure,"Lightest and most fragile armors, mostly worn by the weaker cosmo users, though any normal human would still find its effect amazing. They cover the feet, forelegs, hands, forearms, shoulders, head bands, waist, and some vitals like the heart, but still don’t cover all the body. Anyone awakened to cosmo could use one, making such a user able to shatter stone, move and fight at mach1, and take equally powerful hits. Some have thematic items to supplement them, such as Andromeda’s chains or Dragon’s shield.                  A Cloth is almost always made after something. A creature, a constellation, a star… 
First consequence is that the pieces will be designed so that when the Cloth is not worn, they assemble themselves into “object mode”, a statue-like form at the effigy of its theme. 
Second is that if the source of inspiration had notable associations or properties, it can be translated into minor features. Perhaps it has an affinity or association with fire techniques, a weapon or shield tied to itself, or a favored type of enemies. A Cloth can only have up to 2 of those however, and they may not be overly advantageous given the grade of your Cloth, merely thematic. Cancer’s affinity to Yomotsu (Gold), Libra’s 12 golden weapons (Gold), Andromeda’s chains (Bronze), Centaurus’ fire (Silver) are all examples of what you could reasonably do.

Two paths are possible : 
Choose a cannon constellation/evil star/creature appropriate to your tier. You either create a new original Cloth with the same attunement, gain a copy of the original, or gain the original itself and replace its previous owner, with their respective implied consequences. 
You nonetheless gain the cannon emblematic techniques as starting moveset, as per the Basic Training perk.


Alternatively, you can create your own unique theme for your Cloth, based on an asterix, other star or even an otherworldly inspiration from another jump setting you visited. Its affinities, if any, are left up to you.
You gain an original moveset whose strength is adapted to its tier and whose nature is adapted to its source.
                         "
102,300,God Cloth Potential,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Treasure,"By absorbing the blood of it’s patron God or proximity with one of his divine artefact, a Cloth can evolve into a God Cloth version of itself, rivaling even the original Kamui and amplifying your cosmo to the point of harming and damaging said Gods and Kamui. It however is a temporary state and comes only in situations of great stress and need, in canon when someone as strong as a gold saint with his 8th sense awoken would burn his cosmos to its very limits. This perk only makes the potential for the transformation permanent, not the transformation itself. 
"
103,300,Saints' Cloths ,Saint Seiya Omega,Treasure,"It possess the special ability of adaptation. This means that the
Cloths can evolve and adapt to the user's fighting style and experiences,
becoming more attuned to their Cosmo and granting them new techniques and
powers over time. Obtain a Bronze Tier Armor."
104,300,Martians' Galaxy Armor,Saint Seiya Omega,Treasure,"Galaxy Armor grants the wearer the ability of spatial
manipulation. This allows the user to manipulate space around them, enabling
them to teleport short distances, create spatial barriers for defense, or distort
space to disorient opponents. Obtain a Bronze Tier Armor."
105,300,Palasites' Chronotectors,Saint Seiya Omega,Treasure,"Chronotectors bestow the power of temporal
manipulation upon the wearer. This ability allows the user to control time within a
localized area, enabling them to slow down or accelerate time, manipulate
temporal flow to trap opponents, or even rewind time to undo damage or
mistakes. Obtain a Bronze Tier Armor."
106,300,Nine Elements Cauldron,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Treasure,"A cauldron that is typically used to melt down treasures
for their elemental essence, so that someone can then repurpose them into forging a new treasure
that is even stronger than the many that were melted down. Unlike others, however, this one seems

to be able to melt down items of any level, and can remember the traits of any treasures it melts
down and apply them to other items."
107,300,Six Realms Staff,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Treasure,"This Staff wielded by Buddha himself is a Divine Weapon of considerable Power. As the one who reached Enlightenment Buddha can draw power from the six worlds which mankind can reincarnate into, better known as the six realms, with each one having a form of the Bodhisattava Kannon protecting them. A ability you may share with this tool. The power of those six guardian Buddhas is stored within the Staff and may be tapped into with emotions. These powers are rather vast and it would take a truly powerful God to oppose such an Artifact in the hands of one who knows how to use it. However because it relies on emotion, you are unable to truly decide what form to wield. Your emotions do it for you. Five of its known forms are a long, golden halberd, a giant spiked club capable of dealing massive blunt force, nearly knocking out Zerofuku in a single blow, a golden shortsword, a giant golden shield capable of withstanding Zerofuku's giant axe strike without sustaining any damage and a giant scythe with the head of a lion, which can only be attained through pure hatred."
108,300,Talisman,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"Hanging around your neck is a pretty piece of jewellery. Could be a golden cross, a string of pearls or just a nice little amulet with a picture of someone precious to you. This necklace is able to draw in the life energy that flows through your body, with no upper limit on how much it can store and no level of decay in what is stored within the item. At any time this Talisman is on your body, you may reach into its stores of energy and draw out as much as you want, up to the limit of what you have put in over the time you have had it. Store a little bit every day and you could find yourself with a huge emergency reserve after a few years. Why, you might even be able to crush one of the Gods beneath your feet if you let those years of gathering go in one shot."
109,300,Archaean Skill Scroll,A Will Eternal,Treasure,"A cultivation technique suitable for a Celestial realm cultivator to use. The power of this skill
will slowly be unleashed as the user advances in cultivation. Originally created by an
Archaean, this skill will only start to become less effective once one progresses to the
Archaean realm and begins to pursue their own specific Dao. Before this though, it will
greatly help in your road to cultivation, surpassing the vast majority of techniques. Whether
this is a body cultivation, soul cultivation, or spiritual cultivation manual is up to you."
110,300,Aegis of the Overlord,Infernals Exalted,Treasure,"Superheavy plate, the armor of Exalted warriors, too heavy to be worn by mortals except as
mobile walls during sieges. It covers the wearer’s entire body in interlocking plates of heavy
verdigrised brass and malfean iron, foregoing chain reinforcements entirely in favor of artfully
arranged and reinforced metal to leave not a single gap in its sleek bulwark.
With its thick plating and nigh-indestructible make, this armor would allow you to ignore all
but the most powerful blows. Only the head is left uncovered, but for the accompanying
helmet. Imposing and spiked, it is as much a crown as a helmet, carrying a socket intended
for a single shining hearthstone upon the brow. When worn, it darkens the face of the wearer
still visible through the face slot, simultaneously bestowing a gaze of burning green fire to
the wearer’s eyes and cloaking them in terror and authority magnified a thousand times. The
mere arrival of the wearer at the battlefield is often enough to turn the tide of battle, as
terrified awe spreads through the ranks of both enemy and ally alike. It is not uncommon for
even an army that massively their enemy to rout and flee when confronted with an overlord
of hell who has donned his terrible armor."
111,400,Void Key,Cradle V1,Treasure,"You gain a magical space closet, about 7 feet by 3 feet. This can be used to store anything you need. No weight limit just needs to be able to stuff inside the door."
112,400,A Barrel of Soulfire,Cradle V1,Treasure,"This will make you the envy of all. You gain a barrel of soulfire, that allows you to bathe any item inside and bring it closer to the platonic ideal. (A comb dipped in the stuff can brush the toughest of tangles, a sword will keep the sharpest edge possible for it) It will refill in about a minute. You can choose to absorb it and become a wellspring of the valuable substance."
113,400,Parasite Ring,Cradle V1,Treasure,This half-silver ring will make your cycling take twice as long but will double the gains from it.
114,400,How to Advance for Dummies,Cradle V1,Treasure,"You get a book that tells you exactly how to advance further for any path you encounter, and you can share the lessons for anyone you let read. The lessons become etched in the mind of those who read it, so they won’t ever misremember what you shared with them."
115,400,Silver Armor,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Treasure,"A step up from the level of Bronze, this armor provides more protection and
covers a bit more of the user’s body, as well as being able to withstand more pressure and
physical punishment than a Bronze armor could. They may also possess a unique weapon or
ability, such as a powerful elemental attack or a shield that turns those who gaze upon it into
stone. However, it has a higher starting requirement than Bronze Armor - you will need to train
and refine your Cosmo a little to use this effectively."
116,400,Silver Grade Cloth,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Treasure,"Better, more covering armors than Bronze, with true helmets and propper upper chestplate. Tougher as well, pushing their users up to mach5 for the fastest, but the toll in cosmo makes it available only to the elite of humans that didn’t awaken their 7th sense. They can also have, more often than Bronze it seems, special qualities or items like a Medusa’s petrifying shield or Cerberus’ flail bolas thingys.
A Cloth is almost always made after something. A creature, a constellation, a star… 
First consequence is that the pieces will be designed so that when the Cloth is not worn, they assemble themselves into “object mode”, a statue-like form at the effigy of its theme. 
Second is that if the source of inspiration had notable associations or properties, it can be translated into minor features. Perhaps it has an affinity or association with fire techniques, a weapon or shield tied to itself, or a favored type of enemies. A Cloth can only have up to 2 of those however, and they may not be overly advantageous given the grade of your Cloth, merely thematic. Cancer’s affinity to Yomotsu (Gold), Libra’s 12 golden weapons (Gold), Andromeda’s chains (Bronze), Centaurus’ fire (Silver) are all examples of what you could reasonably do.

Two paths are possible : 
Choose a cannon constellation/evil star/creature appropriate to your tier. You either create a new original Cloth with the same attunement, gain a copy of the original, or gain the original itself and replace its previous owner, with their respective implied consequences. 
You nonetheless gain the cannon emblematic techniques as starting moveset, as per the Basic Training perk.


Alternatively, you can create your own unique theme for your Cloth, based on an asterix, other star or even an otherworldly inspiration from another jump setting you visited. Its affinities, if any, are left up to you.
You gain an original moveset whose strength is adapted to its tier and whose nature is adapted to its source."
117,400,Silver Warrior,Saint Seiya Omega,Treasure,"This armor is a bit stronger than the bronze armor, and only a very few elite
followers with heightened Cosmo can wear such powerful armor of this level. As
they cover more of the body than the bronzes one.The power enhancements and
endurance that this armor provides are amazing. At a minimum, your punches
now reach speeds of Mach five and you can survive hits from divine beings while
barely clinging to life."
118,400,Regeneration,Saint Seiya Omega,Treasure,"Your armor has gained the ability that only one armor in the world possesses:
regeneration. Now, as long as you have Cosmo to burn, you can rebuild your
armor over and over again, until you drop dead."
119,400,"Divine Weapon",Feng Shen Ji,Treasure,"The strongest of the Ancient Gods were able to construct armaments from their 
own Divine Power, usually taking        on the form or having an ability that 
compliments the user's own. For example, Chi Long manifests a large 
warhammer to amplify his Flame manipulation to the point of creating eruptions 
of magma whenever he strikes the ground, or Tian Long's Blood Spear which 
creates a crystal spear that is virtually indestructible considering his Divine Power 
can destroy/erode anything in his vicinity. As this weapon will be derived from 
your Divine Power, it will grow in strength with you and be able to compliment 
any of your other abilities just as well. It can be summoned, recalled, and 
dismissed at will while repairing itself within 3 days of non-use if damaged or 
destroyed. You may import a previous weapon into this role and/or import this 
gear as a weapon ino future Jumps.
You have the possibility to purchase the Divine Power perk for 50cp if you roll this perk."
120,400,Seed of Longevity,Feng Shen Ji,Treasure,"This golden orb that takes root in a person's chest wouldn't normally be found until halfway through this story. Once implanted into a person,  the recipient no longer requires sustenance and sleep as their body is fueled by Smelting Aura (becoming a pseudo-Citizen of Wan Qu). The nasty bit about this orb is that it slowly converts its host into Smelting Aura and eventually turning them into a fruit tree (with its bounty being made of pure Smelting Aura). You gain ten of these orbs straight from the White Creed that restock at the end of the month as well as the knowledge on how to create or modify these orbs; like tweaking the conversion process. And since you paid CP for this item, any orbs that you create and/or implant yourself will have their recipients become zealously loyal to you; only turning into fruit trees of Smelting Aura by your whim. 

Gain the Smelting Aura perk if you consume this seed. "
121,400,Zero Numbering Growing Artifact: Dragon Essence Blade ,Reincarnator,Treasure,"The Dragon
Essence Blade is a Growing Artifact that grows every time one enhances their body
using it. The Dragon Essence Blade enhances the skeletal structure while the
essence that comes with it reconstructs and greatly enhances the user's body. It also
increases the regeneration speed of the user.
One can control the bone fragments and have it form a small shield in one's hand."
122,400,Zero Numbering Growing Artifact : Mana Jade ,Reincarnator,Treasure,"The Mana Jade is a
shining crystal-shaped marble growing Artifact that consists of four jewels. The Mana
Jade is inserted above the user's heart and syncs up with the user's heart. If the
Mana Jade is burnt out from overuse, it will turn off and won't work for a while. The
Mana Jade supplies the body with tremendous amounts of mana. It is a tier higher
than the Mana Pool Surgery. Instead of being a higher tier Mana Pool, it's more like
a lower tier Mana Engine."
123,400,Solo Numbering 6 : Weapon Eater,Reincarnator,Treasure,"This armor is a Growing Artifact that
grows by eating up gears. It would get harder and harder and change its color once
enough has been devoured. It would evolve once it ate thousands and thousands of
gears. It only ate the good materials from those gears then created armor that fit the
user's body. It shows a much higher hardness and mana conductivity compared to
other armors."
124,400,Zero Numbering Growing Artifact : Forked Lightning,Reincarnator,Treasure,"A giant 3m golden spear, a spear of
punishment, that allowed the Elvenheim King to kill anybody who has gone against
the king, whoever they may be. The Forked Lightning is a growing artifact. It has a
homing effect and can follow a target over long distances if supplied with enough
mana. It has great durability, flexibility, and penetration. It is very near unbreakable."
125,400,Solo Numbering Growing Artifact : Arham’s Shield,Reincarnator,Treasure,"The godly treasure of
the empire. A shield which disperses all forms of energy that are malicious towards
it. Arham's Shield is a small black shield one can attach to their hand. Yellow light
emits from the shield when one pours mana into it. There is a strange indent on the
shield. It was held by Tiamet. The yellow light that emits from it can gnaw away at
the enemy's mana and reinforcement. Though it does not have a uniquely powerful
attack like the God's Flail, this single passive skill effect in a battle is tremendous on
its own. It is inferior to the Power Destruction ability of Nurmaha's Ring but still works
as a form of dispelling."
126,400,Solo Numbering Growing Artifact : Rangkom’s Stake,Reincarnator,Treasure,"One of the godly
treasures of the empire. A very ordinary, sharp, white stake. Looks crappy looking.
There are a few protrusions in the stake.

Tiamet was using this stake in order to take in and suppress a large amount of mana
into his body in order to transcend and become a dragon.
Not much is known about its abilities. It can suck in a tremendous flow of energy and
suppress that energy into one's own body. The user can use the mana within to
power one's skills, even if one isn't present."
127,400,Solo Numbering 3 Growing Artifact : God’s flail,Reincarnator,Treasure,"One of godly treasures
of the empire, God's Flail pulls out the souls within it to power itself.
God's Flail is a head-sized blood red metal object that resembles a bell or anvil. It is
covered by hundreds of bloody veins powered by mana. These veins radiate a ton of
heat. There is a strange hole in the flail. By using a minuscule amount of energy from
the souls within, the flail can be thrown towards enemies and home in on them using
sharp turns. Blocking it will cause a person's body to blow up while dodging it will
cause the person's head to be pierced by the snake-like movement of the flail. Using
the flail to smash directly is more efficient than throwing it however."
128,400,Zero Numbering Growing Artifact : Dark Cloud,Reincarnator,Treasure,"The Dark Cloud artifact
grows the more it infects. It can be summoned from a person's body at any time.
When an organism is infected, they can be enhanced. An infected beast would be
able to win against 3 of its previous versions. Infected beings are able to regenerate
itself no matter the attack until the owner of the cloud or the cloud itself dies. Even if
one knows about the cloud, if they do not use a special attack it will not die.
To control a living being, one needs to beat it half dead and put the dark cloud inside
of it. At the same time one can receive their memories.
To control a nonliving thing, one must inject the cloud and mana into the object. The
cloud sends information about the object to the user. It is also capable of molding
liquid metal into armor."
129,400,Flying Ship,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Treasure,"This is a flying ship commonly employed by the denizens of this world
for their general travel, and sometimes for escaping. This one is surprisingly high quality and can
move faster than most Wanxiang Adepts at their peak. Its true strength, however, comes from the
fact that adding your own energy to it can increase its speed to what yours is at the time, allowing a
Celestial Immortal to make the ship accelerate to his own speed. It does, however, cap out at the
limit of the Heavenly Daos (the speed of light) and will not move past that point no matter how
fast you are."
130,400,Unfed Forge,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Treasure,"The biggest problem with techniques or artifacts is that eventually, if you don’t rise in power,
status, or connections, you won’t be able to procure the necessary materials needed to also bring
your power up to par with others at your level. So I’d say it's a good thing that you have the
ability to use the same materials at lower levels to create things at your level of power. If you felt
like it you could use Steel to make a Golem capable of killing Celestial Immortals while you
were a World God. With materials meant for actual immortals, even baseline Celestial
Immortals, you would be able to create artifacts capable of comparing to Universe

treasures(assuming you’re at that level of strength)."
131,400,Lifeblood Weapon,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Treasure,"Lifeblood Weapons are tools that grow with those they are bound to. This particular weapon
comes in whatever form you wish, even as a set of weapons, and is already at the level of a
Chaos Weapon. Unlike other lifeblood weapons, all this one needs is to feed on your energy to
grow to your level of power. It is however much quicker to feed it precious materials. You may

import any past weapons into this role."
132,400,Celestial Trash: Tools of Calamity,Avesta of Black and White,Treasure,"The Forge of Ruin Khvarenah is the source of the most powerful and advanced artifacts under the First Heaven. But the mightiest of Arch-Demons cares little on which side his artifacts end up, he is just content with devouring worlds for materials and then producing artifacts, left for whoever is brave enough to pick them. You have picked up an especially powerful artifact, comparable to Magsariom’s armor capable of regenerating from any wound and giving anyone the power of Ego, Maluk Talus, or Mashyag, which grants the user’s desires by creating duplicates."
133,400,Eternal Snow/Sun Roots ,Trinity Wonder,Treasure,"At some point in the past, maybe after falling off of a glacial cliff for the fourth time, you came across the eternal roots. This is an extremely mystical and rare plant. If you were to consume these roots, you would gain a body completely immune to a specific affinity of ki depending on the type of roots. Consuming the Eternal Snow Roots would make you become completely immune to Yin ki, and thus cold based damage in general. Similarly, the Eternal Sun Roots would make you immune to Yang ki and heat based damage. Being frozen in a pillar of ice, or blasted by the full force of a dragon’s fire would be more annoying than painful."
134,400,Festering Life Sword,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"The cursed tool of the cockroach cursed spirit Kurourushi, despite its name the Festering Life Sword appears less like a traditional blade, and more like a thick- bladed cleaver made of flesh. Despite its impractical shape, it’s a perfectly serviceable sword, capable of cutting just as well as any regular blade. That said, its main draw are the six barrels built into its blade, each of which holds a small egg.

At any time, you can cause these barrels to fire out their payload, the eggs rapidly flying forth towards whatever the blade’s swung at. Should these eggs make contact with flesh they’ll burrow beneath the skin, and in a matter of seconds they’ll hatch, fist-sized insect cursed spirits bursting out of the poor victim’s body. It only takes mere seconds for the sword to ‘reload’ too, the barrels rapidly refilling to be fired once again. The curses created through this weapon, though weak individually, are subservient to you."
135,400,Supreme Martial Solution,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"Alongside Hiten, Supreme Martial Solution was one of the two cursed tools wielded by Sukuna. Shaped like a vajra, a weapon symbolising a thunderbolt, it unsurprisingly has properties to do with lightning. Just by holding it aloft and willing it, you can cause the weapon to fire off powerful blasts of electricity, leaving behind craters in the ground wherever its lightning strikes. Naturally, it probably won’t be much use against someone resistant to electricity, but against anyone else? It’ll make a devastating weapon indeed."
136,400,Dragon-Bone,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"The masterpiece of the curse user Juzo Kumiya, Dragon-Bone is a cursed tool in the form of a single-edged sword. With a crude-looking leather handle, a mechanical hilt, and a thick blade with three vents near the hilt on the blunt end, it’s a rather odd- looking weapon, but deadly nonetheless. Through normal use, especially when used to strike something, it accumulates force and cursed energy within the blade. Then, at any time the user wishes, these can be ejected from the vents like jets, granting the blade an explosive boost in speed and cutting power. Such power is enough for it to slice clean through metal reinforced by cursed energy, to say nothing of the violence it could do to a person’s body. Even without its boosts, it’s still a sharp and durable weapon regardless, enough to wound almost any cursed spirit."
137,400,Special Grade Cursed Tool(400),Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"By purchasing this option, you receive a cursed tool imbued with one of the abilities from the cursed technique section, allowing you to wield it through this item. The exact form of your cursed tool, as well as how it specifically interacts with the cursed technique it carries, is up to you. Perhaps you have a megaphone that allows you to use Cursed Speech when talking through it, a shamisen imbued with Boogie Woogie that switches people’s places when played, or a sword that slowly leaks blood that its wielder can control as if by Blood Manipulation. As long as its effects are related to the original technique – and don’t exceed it in power or ignore its limitations – it should be possible.

The price for such an object is equal to the original cost of the cursed technique.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
138,400,Black Rope ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"A cursed tool crafted by a clan of African sorcerers over the course of several decades, the Black Rope is exactly what its name implies: a piece of black rope, several metres in length. It’s a rather versatile tool, strong enough to let you swing off of lamp posts, grab objects from afar to fling them, and strike others like a whip. Its real draw, however, is that the rope has the ability to cancel out any cursed technique it comes into contact with. Even a defence on the level of Limitless’ infinity could be easily bypassed by it.
 
That said, it does have a weakness: each time it’s used to interfere with a cursed technique, a part of it burns away. Each individual use only destroys a small amount, but over the course of a fast-paced yet protracted battle, it might not be long until it’s significantly shorter than it was before. Fortunately for you, your version of the Black Rope has the ability to repair itself, slowly regenerating black to its full length over time."
139,400,Heirloom Weapon ,Kara no Kyokai,Treasure,"An ancient weapon of a Demon Hunting clan, perhaps even a replica of the Kanesada Kuji that the Ryougi treasure. A five hundred year old weapon, already a heavy weight of mystery, but with a particular bend towards damaging and destroying magecraft it comes into contact with, at least when younger and weaker than the weapon itself. A sword from this option might disband lesser bounded fields just from being withdrawn from the scabbard and swinging such a blade could cut through even powerful magical barriers that otherwise lock space itself tight.
"
140,400,Bow of Hercules,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"The mighty bow of Heracles himself. A single shot from this bow, even from a normal human and with a normal arrow, has the power to split a truck in half and destroy the road behind the vehicle. As the user’s power increases, so too will the force they may fire the arrows with, as long as their physical strength is also matching. Any arrows fired are also coated in a weakened hydra’s blood, which will weaken any struck target’s body over time."
141,400,Rough Power Stones,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"You find a cave connected to either your warehouse or a property of choice. Within this cave is a seemingly endless source of glowing green rocks. These are Rough Power Stones, in unmined form. When properly prepared, in a fashion you receive the instructions to, these stones can draw in any life energy in the air around them, especially the energy released by fighters trained in the use of it. If pressed against the body of a living being, it can either drain their innate life energy, slowly killing them, or transfer the energy already in the stone to that being. The stones each have a maximum amount of energy they can store at once, based on the stones overall size, but when gathered in massed groups, they can be used to accomplish incredible feats of supernatural power or magic."
142,400,Walmung,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"A dark silver broadsword with a bird wing shaped hilt, it covers the users’ right arm in plate armour when brought about. This sword is especially strong in how it enhances the user’s attack power, enough to make a man ordinarily able to destroy a house with one blow wipe clean a whole city block with a single slash. It is also able to enter a defensive mode, spreading the plate armour on the user’s right arm to cover their entire body."
143,400,Mjolnir        ,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"A super heavy war hammer made for one handed use. The hammer is also able to emit blasts of lightning but it’s most special property is in fact the ability of the wielder to absorb the hammer into their body. This allows the user to charge their physical strikes with much greater force than usual, imbue their body with huge amounts of electrical power to attack foes with and continue to use the usual traits of a National Treasure even with it inside their own body."
144,400,Bashōsen,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Treasure,"A large fan that is able to generate all five of the basic nature
transformations, requiring its user just to give a mental command to it, which
produces substantial amounts of the desired element when the fan is waved.
The fan can also be used as a shield to protect its user against elemental
techniques."
145,400,Alien Cells,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Treasure,"After Hashirama’s death, many different people, like Danzo,
Orochimaru and even Madara, managed to acquire samples of his cells and DNA
and made experiments to try to gain his power. The majority of these experiments
failed and resulted in deaths, but a few ones managed to achieve good results, with
different degrees of success. Madara, for example, created a mindless clone of
Hashirama, capable of producing a substance made of his cells that could heal
injuries and replace lost limbs, as well as usually increasing the user’s chakra
reserves and granting access to some Wood Release abilities, while Victor used his
cells to induce a splinter of the Earth’s God Tree to make it grow an artificial (and
incomplete) tree. All of these features granted by Hashirama’s Senju physiology is
thanks to him being a descendant of an Ōtsutsuki, in this case, Kaguya herself. It’s
logical that the cells from an Ōtsutsuki will have slightly different features, but more
powerful. You get a few samples of Ōtsutsuki’s cells, enough to reproduce it infinitely
with proper equipment. These cells grant the same benefits as the Hashirama’s
cells, but without the risk of rejection due to the Ōtsutsuki physiology being much
more malleable. They also won’t grant Wood Release abilities, but they grant all the
basic nature transformations (including Yin Release and Yang Release) to those that
are implanted with it and may cause their kekkei genkai, if they have any, to evolve
into new forms or even achieve power compared to their kekkei mōra versions. You
receive new samples yearly."
146,400,"Kōkinjō, Shichiseiken, and Benihisago",Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Treasure,"Despite being three separate tools,
I’ll put them together because it’s needed to use all three of this set to their
effect be complete. First of all, Kōkinjō is a rope capable of drawing out the
word soul of anyone that it has come in contact with, except its wielder. The
rope is also capable of generating a yellow aura that takes the shape of

additional ropes. Once the target’s word soul is drawn out by the rope, it
allows the user to sever it using the Shichiseiken, a light blue broad and flat
sword, and, by saying the verbal command “curse”, allowing their soul to be
sucked to the Benihisago. Lastly, the third artifact is a giant brown-coloured
gourd with a red cloth around it. It is able to take a person's word soul hostage
by saying the verbal command ""record"". After the word soul has been drawn
out by the Kōkinjō and then severed from their body by the Shichiseiken, it is
absorbed into the gourd. If the victim utters the word they have said the most
during their life, they will be sucked into and trapped within the Benihisago.
According to Kurama, once something or someone is trapped within it, they
can't come out, no matter what, but your version of it is capable of releasing
whoever is sealed within it if you want."
147,400,Knight’s Armoury,Angel Notes,Treasure,"The legendary Knight Arms, weapons of the Ether Liners, are made by externalising the Grain within
the bodies of each Ether Liner and forming it into a solid weapon in the outside world. While you no
doubt have your own Knight Arm, given you are a knight, now you’ve become able to use a similar
process on other internal energies. Any supernatural energy or material that is produced from within
you can now be externalised into a unique Knight Arm based on that energy. The stronger the base
you choose to work with, the stronger the resulting Knight Arm will be. You can make a single such
Knight Arm for each distinct supernatural energy or material produced from within your being."
148,400,Pelt of the Divine Beast,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Treasure,"The skinned pelt of the Nemean Lion, a legendary beast that Heracles once strangled to death. The
pelt, either looking like a lion belt or as a simple black sash, delivers a potent protection to anyone
that wears it. It rejects human civilisation, making the wearer immune against all the tools that
humanity has made. Regardless of the power of or behind the tool, so long as you have the pelt
somewhere on your body, it cannot harm you. At most, you might feel a tickle or a light brush, regardless of the monstrously powerful weapons used against you. The pelt itself will never be
ripped or torn, though it provides no physical protection on it’s own. "
149,400,Akhilleus Kosmos,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Treasure,"The shield made for Achilles by the god Hephaestus. Engraved with a detailed depiction of the Greek
world, the shield, beyond being an effective indestructible object, is able to project a immensely
powerful bounded field in response to any attack. To oppose the shield is the same as making a
world your opponent, is what is said, and the bounded field acts as if all of Greece was between the
attacker and you when activated. Should an attack be incapable of piercing both through such a
magical dimensional construct and lack the power to tear through an entire country, it will fail to
reach you. However, not only does the shield’s bounded field cost energy to activate and maintain, it
will prove far less capable against any attack particularly capable against ‘worlds’ or dimensional
constructs like this."
150,400,Kavacha and Kundala,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Treasure,"Weaved from the light of the gods, the armour that is bound to your form could rightly be called a
near-invincible protection. A tight suit of armor integrated into your body, it provides unmatched
protection against any threat, whether physical or conceptual. All harm that comes to you from
outside of your body is reduced by ninety percent of it’s damage, turning major wounds into small
scratches and cuts. Many magical spells and powers will be reduced to useless sparks or negated
outright, such as the armor preventing you from being erased from reality by those that can warp
such things. But this protection does not apply inwardly, allowing any harm that originates from
inside your body to proceed unaffected, such as summoned spears piercing you from within. You can
take off the armor and even give it to others, the integration into your body able to be undone with
a thought. As well, when in the way physically, the armor can recede inside of your body to allow
you full access. Optionally, you may have a flamboyant cape of flowers appear behind you when the
armor is present on your skin."
151,400,Avalon,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Treasure,"The legendary sheath of Excalibur, a copy of which now rests at your hip, though no one finds it
strange that it does so. This sheath is an incredibly valuable artefact, as it bestows powerful
regenerative abilities on you while at your side, allowing you to heal from almost any wound in
minutes at most. Even if most of your body was vaporised, as long as your brain and a fair amount of
the flesh and bone connected to it remained, you could restore yourself to normal in five minutes of
healing. Avalon cannot heal brain wounds and you will die if it is destroyed, though the item also
struggles to handle cursed wounds. Though it drains your energy, you can also activate the special
power of the sheath, which will place you in the world of Avalon while you maintain it. While here, it
is almost impossible to reach you and even dimension crossing effects will only work from insanely
powerful users. Effectively, it lets you dodge away out of almost any effect in an instant. Notably, Avalon as a sheath will resize to fit any sword you wish to put into it."
152,400,Bow of the Hydra,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Treasure,"Favoured weapon of the greatest hero of Greece, the Bow of the Hydra is the same weapon that
Heracles would use to slay some of his greatest foes. The bow itself is not particularly special, as
beyond being usable as a nearly indestructible club if need be and somewhat enhancing the power
of shots fired by it, it lacks magical traits. The quiver the bow comes with is very different, holding an
endless supply of both exceptionally tough and sharp arrows as well as arrows coated in the Hydra’s
poison, a substance capable of quickly and painfully killing almost any being. Only an immortal being
could avoid death, should the poison enter their blood, but it will still deliver unending agony unless
they could use powerful magic to remove the poison. "
153,400,Tauropolos,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Treasure,"A very large and sturdy bow, taller than some men, but with powerful enchantments placed on it by
Artemis herself. This jet black bow has a replenishing quiver of similarly dark arrows, each one
capable of piercing all but the most powerful magical defences, and the bow itself grants immense destructive power to any shot fired through it. It requires no more strength than a normal bow to
pull back but even an ordinary man could blast a fortress into many pieces with a fully drawn shot. The bow is also able to call down a rain of light attacks, by expending some magical energy and firing
two shots at once towards the sky. This results in a rain of arrows of light, each able to easily pierce
thick enchanted metal armour, over a controlled range of attack. Many thousands of light arrows are
released and entire battlefields can be lightly sprayed or the arrows can all be focused on a single
point to deal incredible damage."
154,400,Golden Axe,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Treasure,"A great golden axe, large and heavy enough that one requires superhuman strength to lift the tool at
all. At the top of the axe handle is a reverse pistol grip, a trigger linked to what makes the axe special. A powerful magical weapon already, the axe has fifteen cartridges built into it that store powerful
blasts of lightning. Even one cartridge being triggered unleashes a powerful blast of lightning that
can leave a small city block in ruins. All fifteen at once might split a small mountain into two with the
valley carved by the thunderbolt. These cartridges slowly replenish over time, drawing on the
electricity in the air, but can automatically absorb any lightning attack when empty to protect you
and charge faster. It’ll take some practice to get used to the trigger, though you can optionally
change it’s place on the axe if desired. 

Golden Axe is also able to take on a second form, that of a modern Japanese motorcycle, albeit a
massive one done up in the style of a young gangster. According to one golden man, the bike has
two million horsepower and can travel at over Mach 2. True or not, the wheels are able to rapidly
build up a thunder charge like the cartridges, becoming stronger and more charged with each
revolution. Racing towards a foe turns your bike into a mighty spear of lightning that can tear
through even powerful youkai, if they fail to dodge the extremely visible attack. At least the thunder
from the Axe doesn’t harm you. "
155,400,Caladbolg,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Treasure,"An exceptional sword is rare in the land of spears but hardly unheard of. Particularly when it comes
to the blade now resting in your hands. Caladbolg, legendary sword of Fergus MacRoich and the
prototype weapon for many of the most famous blades in history, such as both Caliburn and
Excalibur. This drill shaped sword meets little resistance even against powerful magical armour or
spells and when it’s true power is released by it’s wielder, it can unleash enormous blasts of light
that can wipe out entire armies. Caladbolg however, excels at the destruction of the landscape and
when used to destroy the environment, it can even render a mountain to slag or shatter whole
islands, much more than it normally can do."
156,400,Bridal Chest,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Treasure,"An enormous war hammer, the head in the shape of a strange bronze ball. While a near unbreakable
weapon and light in your hands despite the stone crushing weight it swings with, these are all minor
physical traits. The true value is the core held within the hammer head, which has the ability to use
the Galvanism trait, in a very similar way to the Living Lightning perk. The hammer can absorb any
wasted magical energy or electric energy from you as well as anything within a short range around
the hammer in your surroundings, acting as a potent defence against magic. The hammer can
unleash massive blasts of lightning, taking the form of tree branch extensions, both in close range
and at a longer distance when targeted. Just picking up ordinary mana and electricty from the air, the hammer is able to unleash bolts that tear humans, cars or houses apart. A large amount of
energy could wipe out a small force of magical golems in an instant.

If used in tandem with the Living Lightning perk, or similar abilities, the two sides work together to
create a much more powerful Galvanism expression. The limits on absorption are largely removed, excess energy in the body immediately discharged through the hammer with great force, allowing
the user to easily defend against even vast amounts of magic. Bridal Chest also grants easier
regulation of energy, greatly improving how much can be used to heal or reinforce your body before
you endanger it.

Bridal Chest is also able to transform into a secondary mode, taking the form of a equally large
sword. In this state, not only can the electricity be used to hone the swords’ edge or cause it to
vibrate at high speeds, the sword can be reversed so that the energy is channeled into a massive
projection of electricity. This energy blade takes a vast amount of fuel but is easily the most
destructive attack the weapon possesses."
157,400,The Sword of Promised Victory,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Treasure,"No light shines greater in the hearts of men than that of glory and no blade embodies that glory
moreso than Excalibur. The blade of light that brings out the fondest feelings of all warriors that see
it, even as it obliterates them, and can force madmen back to sanity with a glimpse of this glory. Excalibur is the embodiment of victory and a mighty weapon in it's own right. A holy blade of truly
peerless strength, endurance and cutting power in this world, it is also able to instantly convert any
amount of magical energy residing in the wielder's body into destructive beams of holy light. Fired as
an energy beam or blast from the tip of the blade in less than a second from activation, the blast of
Excalibur can cleanse almost any foe from the face of the world. While costly to activate even for
King Arthur, it is more than capable of vaporising fortresses, mountains or even Divine Beasts. The
ranks of those that can survive a full power beam, as it can be adjusted for less cost and power, are
limited to powerful Divine Spirits, the mightiest Dragons and beings above them. The weapon is constantly covered in a powerful enchantment of wind, placed by Merlin himself. This
conceals the sword to all eyes but your own, rendering it invisible, and cloaks it in an aura of wind. This wind can be controlled, made to cut and grind away or even unleashed in a powerful blast that
on it's own, would be a match for many powerful magical tools. While this Invisible Air is active, it
significantly reduces the attack power of the blade and prevents you from activating the holy light. The sword must be revealed to the foe to show it's true self, in the manner of a chivalrous knight. Much like the Lance of the End- Rhongomyniad, Excalibur has potentially not normally seen. There
are Thirteen Seals on the blade, one made by each member of the Round Table. Each seal that has
it's condition met, raises the power of the sword even beyond what you might do by charging it with
more energy. Unlocking all Thirteen Seals would return Excalibur to it's original form, a shining light
made to protect the very planet. A weapon that can decisively drive away even the Umbral Star itself
from this world in a single, glorious ray of light."
158,400,Fairy Weapon,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Treasure,"All of the Knights of the Round have their own special weapon. A magical sword, a enchanted bow, a
special shield. These weapons are often crafted by the hands of the fairies themselves, creating
immensely powerful weapons for the greatest protectors of Britain. Now you too have a legendary
weapon in your hands, on the same level as things like Excalibur Galatine, Arondight or Lord Camelot. You might choose an enchanted sword that can unleash gigantic blasts of energy at will or a bow
that fires a dozen shots for every single one you loose or even a flail that can command the wind as
it slams into your foes. You could even have a magical prosthetic arm that unleashes blades and
blasts of light on command."
159,400,Clarent,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Treasure,"The corrupted sword that Mordred stole to use against her father, now finds a copy of itself in your
hands. It appears that it acknowledges you as a rightful owner however, a touch different to poor
Mordred the thief. Clarent is a powerful magical blade, one that makes the wielder stronger, faster
and tougher when holding it as well as significantly increasing their charisma and presence. The
most notable ability of the sword, at least now that it is here, is that you are able to channel your
emotions into the blade alongside mana to unleash potent attacks. The deeper the emotions and
more mana you put in, the more powerful and large the outgoing blast will become."
160,400,Ancient Emperor’s Replication Treasure,Against The Gods,Treasure,"Okay, this is a pretty fascinating thing you’ve
got here! If anyone knew... anyway, what this does is that simply by placing an item inside it, you can
make unlimited copies of it.
Now hold your horses, there are a few details. This treasure has a limited amount of power, and it
takes time to replenish it. Depending on how powerful an item is, the treasure takes proportionately
long to copy it. Something utterly rare or priceless, like, say, a drop of blood from a True God, might
take several days, whereas you could probably copy ordinary pills and stuff continuously."
161,400,Advancement Materials,Cradle,Treasure,"Elixirs, Pills, Spirit Fruit, and so on. This is a treasure trove of
materials that will take a Copper up to Truegold within a matter of months, though it's uses fall
off after that point. The good news is that it restocks every month, and giving these materials to
someone outside of this Jump will allow them to start developing a Core of their own."
162,400,The Three Wells,Cradle,Treasure,"Miniature versions of the 3 Wells of Ghostwater. The Dream Well
sharpens the mind and staves off the need for rest, compared to ""A full night's sleep in a bottle""
The Spirit Well nourishes the soul, making Advancement smoother, easier, and quicker. It can
also help to restore some of the damage inflicted to Madra Channels, though it's not the most
potent thing for this. Lastly, the Life Well restores Youth and strengthens the Lifeline, providing
physical boosts. You have a three-gallon drum of each of these fluids, and they refill once a
month."
163,400,The Ancestral Spear,Cradle,Treasure,"A weapon (It doesn’t have to be a Spear, it can take any form
you desire when you select this, including a prosthetic limb if you wish.) that siphons power from
your foes with every strike. The original only worked properly when stealing Madra from those
who were on the same Path as you, but this version works more akin to Lindon’s Consume
Technique, allowing you to siphon and sort through everything a person has, including their
Madra, Memories, Life Energy, etc, and take it all for yourself. Careful not to take in too much at
once, though, as you might damage yourself by overloading. The sensations involved might
also cause issues when trying to use this as a regular weapon, better to save it until your
opponent is almost dead. Of course, this tool will scale with your Advancement, so you don’t
accidentally explode by trying to take a Truegold’s power at Foundation level."
164,400,Panoply of One,Solars Exalted,Treasure,"A war is a conflict between armies, a clash of thousands of soldiers
pitting themselves against each other. But often, you may find yourself simply fighting on your
own. Artifacts are helpful, yes, but they are also costly in Essence and attuning yourself to a
complete armory is often impractical. No longer will you need any weapon beyond your own
light. You are able to ‘attune’ yourself to a single weapon or armor after a day’s worth of
meditation, even if it is not normally considered an Artifact. So long as the weapon does not
resist or repel you in some fashion, this attunement allows you to forge an exact replica of this
weapon with your own Essence. The cost is higher for weapons that possess inherent magical
abilities or world-shaking powers, while mundane weapons cost you nothing to make a replica
of. These copies possess all the functions and abilities of their original, with bottomless
ammunition for bows or firewand-like weapons, and last up until the battle has passed. In effect,
it functions similarly to the Charm Glorious Solar Saber...but you wield more than a simple
sword or two now, don’t you?"
165,400,The Vassal's Sword,Infernals Exalted,Treasure,"Wrought from infernal Brass and etched with Vitriol, this Daiklave is a true masterpiece.
Forged in the heart of My Illustrious Forge, upon the very anvil of my King's hardened black
bone. Requiring the rarest of ingredients, and possessing the Azoth of one of My own
component souls. It was smelted by my light and heat. Hammered into shape by my hands.
All that to make a blade that could be a weapon to rival and mirror my own. And through my
efforts I forged a sword that captures the glories of the Sword of the Yozi. Now, this greatest
of blades is offered to you.
If you should accept and wield this greatest of boons, offered only as an expression of our
magnanimity, you will be filled with the might of an entire army, you presence magnified into
a terrible being of more-than-divine wrath. And further, you may use it to draw upon my
light, to move with speed unrivaled by all as blazing green contrails surround you."
166,400,Five Edicts Dominion,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"Legend claims that this hulking black suit of plate armor may be the first soulsteel artifact
ever created, dating back to the Divine Revolution. Whether or not it was first, it’s assuredly
ancient. Five Edicts Dominion was forged from the laws of the ancients themselves as they
tumbled past the lips of dying titans on the winds of their final breaths. Indistinct shades of
long-extinct species shift slowly across its matte-black surface. Wicked spikes protrude from
its majestic pauldrons and regal crown-helm.
Over the millennia, the restless dreaming of the Old Laws trapped in the steel has woken
something inside. The dying breaths of beings not meant to die are too potent to be silently
tamed, and they have formed a consciousness over time. The armor is sentient and can
speak to an attuned Exalt even when not worn, or anyone close by when unattuned. What it
ultimately wants is anyone’s guess, but canny Exalts should be wary of its promises.
“Of course, you aren’t just any Exalt, are you...? We can provide you much that would be
hidden from you without our help. We can tell you of the dead and the Underworld, of dead
and archaic languages. We can grant you the incomprehensible word that commands beings
to kneel before you. We can channel words of denial, tainting the air with its chilling timbre.
And we can allow you to bargain with the ancient and unknowable dead, petitioning the void
to grant your wishes at a price. So why don’t you put the armor on, mighty deathknight?”
“You have nothing to fear from us.”"
167,400,Sable Psychopomp of Ominous Tides,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"The Psychopomp is a trireme, as the attack vessels of the Realm, but its resemblance to
these vessels of the Second Age is like that of the eagle to the hen. Larger than any ship
ever build by the shipyards of the Time of Tumult, this massive ship somehow still both far
faster and more maneuverable than its lesser cousins, floating gracefully over the waves. Its
sleek black hull is propelled forward as much by sorcerous means, as by imperishable sails
of cloth-of-jade and almost a thousand skeletal oarsmen laboring below decks.
The black teak of its construction is a dense hardwood originating from the Font of Mourning,
valued all over the Underworld, especially for shipbuilders, for its wood is nearly flame proof,
as well as resistant to rot and the Essence drain of the Sea of Shadows. Reinforced with
soulsteel and magic, both in vast quantities, the hull and masts are indestructible and
impenetrable to Essence besides, such that not even immaterial spirits may pass through.
Armed not with the mundane catapults or ballistae common to sea-going vessels now, it
instead carries the powerful First Age weapons known as lightning ballistae. When fired,
each ballista releases a powerful blast of lightning that sears and scorches whatever it hits,
turning flesh and wood to ash and melting steel or stone.
But its greatest power is perhaps the one least expected of such a juggernaut of a ship, for
at the command of its captain, the prow with its reinforced ram can pitch upwards to allow
the ship to take to skies. So do oars find purchase in midair, sails catching the winds far
above the surface, to allow the Psychopomp to race amongst the clouds. At night, it could
even slip quietly from Creation into the bleak skies of the Underworld, and vice versa.
Unlike the no-frills triremes of the realm, this ship does have proper accommodations for a
crew and passengers, though not enough to house the hundreds of reanimated dead set to
man the oars. Raised platforms in front and back can hold weapons and lookouts, as well as
cabin for crew, passenger cabins, or even troop barracks."
168,400,Howler in Darkness,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"Usually carried belted at his side, the Silver Prince’s personal appears to be a ceremonial
short sword while. Only when it is drawn is it that revealed that this short sword is in actuality
a grand daiklave forged of soulsteel, with the unusual property of disguising its nature while
sheath, and expanding to its full size as it is drawn.
Should a being struck by Howler in Darkness not instantly have been slain with that blow,
then the wound inflict may overwhelm their will, compelling the target to obey any commands
given by the Silver Prince for the next 100 days... no matter who struck the blow. Though if
you purchase it here, you may usurp that control to bind others to your commands, instead
of the Deathlord’s orders."
169,400,Root of Scorn,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"The Dowager’s principle weapon is her unique soulsteel long powerbow, Root of Scorn. With
but the expense of a single mote, it may be called to hand instantly or banished Elsewhere.
But more importantly, arrows fired from this weapon transform into soulsteel harpoons: Upon
striking a victim, the arrowheads clasp onto the victims bones like tiny clawed soulsteel
hands and cannot be removed without cutting the soulsteel-weave cord attached to Root of
Scorn. Those slain in a shadowland while so attached to Root of Scorn’s cord instantly
become the ghost-slaves to the bow’s owner, as their bodies falls away and the soulsteel
cord remains attached to their higher souls."
170,400,Varan’s Ruin,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"The First and Forsaken Lion wields Varan’s Ruin, a massive grand daiklave over six feet in
length, once the legendary blade of Varan Pen, an Exalted hero of the First Age who
claimed descent from the gods. Noble and steadfast,Varan fell heroically during the
Usurpation, boldly taking the offensive against an army of Dragon-Blooded. For an age, he
wandered the Underworld’s barren wastes and became a champion once more, resisting
the temptations of the Neverborn and helping many ghosts find peace and Lethe. Then, the
Lion found him, captured him, hollowed out his soul, and alloyed it with Varan’s blade into a
massive daiklave that howls with an ancient pain and oddly gleeful depravity.
Varan, now utterly corrupted by the agony of being forged into soulsteel and the base
pleasure he receives when devouring Essence, cries out in mad hunger for his victims’ blood
and souls. When one gazes carefully at Varan’s Ruin, one can see that hero’s face, now
mad with rage and hunger. Each blow dealt with Varan’s Ruin drains essence from its
targets, half of which go directly to the wielder, half of which are devoured by Varan. A killing
blow from Varan’s Ruin absorbs the victim’s soul into the blade, where it is quickly consumed
by Varan. Ghosts who merely touch the sword must also resist Varan’s hunger, lest they are
drawn in as well. The approach of any beings, living or dead, elicits yearning moans and
tormented wails from the blade."
171,400,Siren in Avern,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"The Lover carries a soulsteel blade called the Siren in Avern. Not even a daiklave, but a thin,
translucent rapier, it is only superficially a combat weapon. Successful strikes do not wound
a target's body, but instead strike at the victim’s willpower. Furthermore, anytime the wielder
parries an attack with the Siren in Avern, their attacker must break off the fight and cannot
initiate any further attacks against the wielder for some time. This compulsion ends
automatically if the wielder of the blade attacks their bound foe again, but otherwise can only
resisted through a great exertion of willpower. Worse yet, it can only be avoided by being
utterly heartless, while the most empathic and all-loving of foes even risk falling instantly in
love with the wielder of the Siren for a year and a day."
172,400,Arm of Shades Below,Abyssals Exalted,Treasure,"The Walker in Darkness’ principal weapon is a grand grimcleaver called Arm of Shades
Below. No mortal can lift this mighty soulsteel greataxe. Those who try are sapped of their
strength for some time, rendered as helpless as a small child. Anyone struck with its blade is
also stricken with a rotting pox that slowly putrefies their bodies. One week after infection, no
weapons can be wielded. If a victim finds no cure after one month, they die and become a
walking corpse completely under the control of Walker in Darkness, or under your control if
you purchase the grimcleaver here. The disease carried by the blade cannot be treated
without magic, and even then it is a difficult thing to cure before the black destiny of the
Deathlords will have completely poisoned the victim, tainting even their very name."
173,500,Great Nirvana Sword – Zero ,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Treasure,My... what a beautiful weapon. Its sheer presence makes me want to cry with joy. This is a Weapon born from a Volund between Zerofuku and Buddha. The ultimate divine weapon which none but those who have attained the great Nirvana in the Pure Lands can create. This weapon takes the form of a seven-branched sword with bladed protrusions which are each associated with one of the seven lucky gods. Usually... a Volund is powered by Misery. This one though? It is powered by Compassion... and powerful enough a God who gave the Buddha a good fight can be laid low with one slash.
174,600,Life Cloak,UQ Holder,Treasure,"A twisting dark black cloth that holds far more power than might first appear. A replica of the cloth that Ialdabaoth wears, it is both a powerful weapon and an incredible armor at once. Once you’ve worn it, you are able to mentally command the cloth to move as if it were part of your body, even when you are separated. The cloth can shrink or expand to fit you at any size and stretch several times further than its current size too. When commanded to attack, the cloth can whip out with enough strength to slice through miles of rock at a time or pierce through all but the strongest of magical shields, helped along by its powerful anti-magic properties. When an attack is sent at you and is blocked by the shield, which automatically acts to protect you as best it can, few blows will manage to make you shift at all. The cloth can protect against anyone with less power than the Thousand Master, so long as it actually blocks them."
175,600,Presence,Cradle V1,Treasure,"You gain a baby presence of the Abidan, similar to Dross. This one has been bonded to you, body and soul. It will naturally learn more about the world as you explore the cradle, and other jumps, and eventually be capable of detailed battle plans, complex real- time simulations and more as it observes the world. Give this baby a few thousand years, and you might have a real presence that can go toe to toe with any of the Judges."
176,600,A Sage’s Weapon,Cradle V1,Treasure,"You have gained an item once used by a sage. It will always be usable at your level of cultivation, and will always be one level higher than you, no matter what height you reach. It will be compatible with any path you fallow, and you can learn any path that sage practiced by studying it."
177,600,Gold Armor,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Treasure,"This is the armor of great heroes, those who stand beside the Gods in their
endless battle for the fate of planet Earth. Covering most of the body except for the face, this
armor provides the strongest augmentation to the burning Cosmo of the user, letting them move
at blinding speeds and take much more punishment than any other armor in this world can,
allowing them to shrug off blows from anyone wielding anything short of the Seventh Sense at
their full power. However, this has the highest requirement to be able to use effectively - the
user must have unlocked their Seventh Sense to truly utilize such powerful armor. If not, the
armor will merely weigh them down and their full potential will not be used until that time. While
this armor provides the strongest possible boost to the user’s Cosmo and physical abilities, the
armor doesn’t usually come with special abilities...however, it will tend to supplement and
support your favorite techniques and weapons just as much as your body, shaping to your
needs. It may still have one or several weapons built into the armor as well."
178,600,Jumper Foundation,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Treasure,"...wait, what? Okay. Well. You’ve somehow
inherited a government-sponsored organization and business that stretches across the globe.
This ‘Foundation’ earns about several million dollars in revenue from various sources, and will
happily cover any expense you happen to need with minimal impact on the economy or the
Foundation’s day-to-day business (within reason - its resources are not bottomless). It will also
provide you intel and information on events happening anywhere in the world, alerting you to
any disasters or dangers to either business or the planet at large."
179,600,Gold Grade Cloth,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Treasure,"The best a mortal could normally hope to wield or make. Covering the whole body short of some spots or articulations, they require no less than an awakened mastered 7th sense to operate. Should you have it and such a Cloth both however, you will be clad in an armor unbroken by any mortal since their creation, able to fight at the speed of light and shatter mountains barehanded, reaching heights where, more often than not, matchup, technique and wit is more important than your now ridiculous raw power. Beside the Gods and their Kamuis, few surpass a Gold warrior except another one.
A Cloth is almost always made after something. A creature, a constellation, a star… 
First consequence is that the pieces will be designed so that when the Cloth is not worn, they assemble themselves into “object mode”, a statue-like form at the effigy of its theme. 
Second is that if the source of inspiration had notable associations or properties, it can be translated into minor features. Perhaps it has an affinity or association with fire techniques, a weapon or shield tied to itself, or a favored type of enemies. A Cloth can only have up to 2 of those however, and they may not be overly advantageous given the grade of your Cloth, merely thematic. Cancer’s affinity to Yomotsu (Gold), Libra’s 12 golden weapons (Gold), Andromeda’s chains (Bronze), Centaurus’ fire (Silver) are all examples of what you could reasonably do.

Two paths are possible : 
Choose a cannon constellation/evil star/creature appropriate to your tier. You either create a new original Cloth with the same attunement, gain a copy of the original, or gain the original itself and replace its previous owner, with their respective implied consequences. 
You nonetheless gain the cannon emblematic techniques as starting moveset, as per the Basic Training perk.


Alternatively, you can create your own unique theme for your Cloth, based on an asterix, other star or even an otherworldly inspiration from another jump setting you visited. Its affinities, if any, are left up to you.
You gain an original moveset whose strength is adapted to its tier and whose nature is adapted to its source."
180,600,Gold Warrior,Saint Seiya Omega,Treasure,"This level of armor is only given to the most elite followers within the forces of the
gods they serve. At maximum, there are probably 12 sets of gold level armor in
one faction. As these armors now cover the entire body of the user, this armor
provides one of the strongest augmentations to the burning Cosmo of the user,
enabling them to move at blinding speeds and allowing them to shrug off blows
from anyone wielding anything short of the Seventh Sense at their full power.
However, this has the highest requirement to be able to use effectively - the user
must have unlocked their Seventh Sense to truly utilize such powerful armor."
181,600,Holy Sword,Saint Seiya Omega,Treasure,"Hoo boy, you must truly be one of the most elite warriors of Pallas, as you are
now gifted with one of the four greatest holy swords ever bestowed upon
mortals.as they are infused with the ninth cosmo in them. Please choose one of
the holy swords below:
1. Sword of Great Thunders
This blue sword resembles the Sword of Seven Branches, possessing the
ability to manipulate gravity by either increasing or decreasing it, conjure
thunder, lightning, and storms, create powerful gusts of wind, and even
temporarily paralyze your opponents in time.
2. Sword of the God of Military Arts
This yellow longsword demonstrates remarkable cutting prowess,
effortlessly slicing through gold armor and even the formidable Cape
Sunion. Additionally, it has the ability to cut from a distance. Moreover, it
can emit beams of light capable of absorbing enemy attacks, with these
beams having the capacity to not only cut through but also disintegrate
anything in their path. These attacks boast attack speeds surpassing
natural light and match the cosmos level of the goddess Athena.
3. Sword of Destruction
This massive red Greatsword possesses the power to annihilate golden
armor at the proton level within atoms, making it capable of dismantling
structures at their most fundamental level. Additionally, it grants the
Pallasite wielding it the ""Enhanced Time Destruction"" technique, an
enhanced iteration of ""Time Destruction."" This advanced technique
enables the user to siphon time even from adversaries at the level of
Golden Saints. However, those possessing the seventh sense can only
maintain their consciousness in the face of this formidable ability.
4. Sword of Theogenesis
This verdant sword demonstrates the ability to immobilize individuals with
regular cosmos, including those who have unlocked the Seventh Sense. It
possesses unparalleled cutting capabilities, able to slice through any
earthly material with ease, including gold armor. Additionally, the sword
repels enemy attacks by emitting a potent cosmos, akin to the defensive
maneuvers employed by deities like Poseidon and Abel."
182,600,Gold Cloth,Saint Seiya Episode G,Treasure,"It’d be too strange if you didn’t pick up the very mark of your being. The magical armour used by the most powerful factions of these worlds, be they the Cloths of the Saints or the Soma gifted to the Titans. Whichever you are, you have received one of these as a birthright or as a mark of your progress.

These armours act as multipliers for the power of the one wearing it, and whilst the higher powered armours require a certain amount of base power to use, they will never lose their use even if you have ascended far beyond their normal level of wielder. They often even have unique abilities to them, though you may need to discover these for yourself with practice.

As a Saint, especially one of the Gold class, you have received a Gold Cloth. This may be one of your own specifications or a replica of an existing Gold Cloth. You may summon the armour, in full or in its accompanying storage box, to you at any time. If it is broken, unlike normal, it will slowly repair itself over time until it is back to being good as new.  You may import an existing armour into this option if you desire for no added cost."
183,600,Soma,Saint Seiya Episode G,Treasure,"It’d be too strange if you didn’t pick up the very mark of your being. The magical armour used by the most powerful factions of these worlds, be they the Cloths of the Saints or the Soma gifted to the Titans. Whichever you are, you have received one of these as a birthright or as a mark of your progress.

They often even have unique abilities to them, though you may need to discover these for yourself with practice.

If you are a Titan, you instead receive one of the Soma. Taking the form, at first, of a variety of pitch-black weapons, the Soma are in fact shape-shifting artefacts that can change between weapon and armour form, as well as significantly alter their shape in either state naturally too. A Soma is just as strong as a Gold Cloth and even tougher to break than one too. As with the Gold Cloth, you may take a replica of an existing Soma or design your own.

You may import an existing armour into this option if you desire for no added cost."
184,600,Holy Houses,Saint Seiya Episode G,Treasure,"An immense flying castle has appeared in the sky, a gigantic sanctuary akin to the ones used by all the Titans themselves. Formed of a gigantic castle connected to eleven smaller houses, each of which must be gone through in order before one can approach the castle itself. Covered in powerful magical protections and filled to the brim with weapons of all different kinds, it’s a flying fortress like no other. Sadly, it has none of the powerful artefacts that the original Titan Fortress held but it is automatically run and maintained according to your own will, requiring no extra power to work. It is also able to output a massive wave that drives all humans for many hundreds of miles around it to become fight-loving berserkers that tear each other apart."
185,600,Nightmare Demon Pot,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Treasure,"Put 10 or less demon spirits
inside and they will battle, the strongest one will come out
stronger, having absorbed the traits of its enemies. There is a
chance of failure, but this chance gets lower the more demon
spirits you feed it.
Post-Jump, this can work with other types of beings, as long as
they are similar to demon spirits."
186,600,Spiritual Dao Calligrapher,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Treasure,"A separate branch of calligraphy practiced by many spiritual cultivators is known as dao calligraphy. By writing a single word in calligraphy onto a scroll you can impart a bit of spiritual power and knowledge into the ink and parchment. Simply by concentrating upon the skill and carefully writing the word, you can allow others to learn any single soul-based ability you possess. Although this process takes time, the person who seeks to learn from such words can do so merely by studying and contemplating the meanings they have behind them."
187,600,Solo Numbering 9 Growing Artifact : Nurmaha’s Ring,Reincarnator,Treasure,"Nurmaha's Ring
is a Growing Artifact that has eight abilities, each unlocked after feeding it runes to
the next color. It’s abilities are: Nullification of mana, slow, bleeding, lifesteal, mana
absorption, five sense paralysis, magic resistance nullification and physical
resistance nullification.
Its powers are strong enough that it could be freely used even against transcendent
beings, one of the most powerful artifacts that can be found in the Colored Zones.
It takes a fragment of the soul user and stores it in an hidden pocket dimension that
can be used to resurrect the user by allowing the owner to take over the body of
anyone who equips it and activates its powers, this resurrection will work only once
per jump."
188,600,Primaltwin,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Treasure,"This item is a pearl that is attuned to a single element of your choice. With
methods detailed within a complementary jade slip, you could use this pearl to split your soul to
create another body (which will weaken you until your soul heals), which will be able to train as a
Ki Refiner (with vastly increased training speed if you have a technique that synergises with the
body’s element), allowing you to essentially have two lives, as well as training more quickly in

whichever element the pearl is attuned to. Normally, most people wouldn’t be able to utilize this
technique until becoming a Primal Daoist due to lacking the necessary soul strength, but you won’t
have to worry about that. May be purchased as many times as needed."
189,600,Divine Blade,Campione,Treasure,"A Divine ‘sword’ whose legend has grew enough to be considered a minor god or demigod all on its own. At its basest, it has the ability to empower its user, cut through spells, negate or penetrate magical effects and powers and lift or cancel curses. It also contains greater power than any magical weapon. You won’t need Advent Magic to use it. Depending on the weapon you choose and its legend, other effects and even Authorities may be used."
190,600,Lance of Longinus,Campione,Treasure,"The name is a bit of a misnomer, really. This weapon here has a curious ability, namely, its capable of penetrating all magical defenses as if they were paper as well as being able to target and damage the ‘soul’ of those in its path. For some this ability wouldn’t matter much, but the Authorities wielded by the Campiones are tied to their souls and a good hit from this blade could seriously cripple them. Aside from that, I’m sure you can see the uses of a weapon capable of striking souls and no sell magic."
191,600,Fancy Chains,Campione,Treasure,"This is a plain-looking circlet imbued with Keeper of the Horses, a powerful ancient spell that allows the user to subdue an unruly god by placing it around their head. It will paralyze the god and seal off their divinity, making them as dangerous as a baby while the effect is on. The effects aren’t eternal and the circlet can be taken off by another under certain circumstances, but it can be  used to gain advantage in some cases."
192,600,Soukyoku,Bleach,Treasure,"A replica of the halberd of execution, the tool used by the Shinigami to absolutely annihilate the
souls of their worst criminals. At least, the ones that have no further use to Soul Society. The Halberd
is vast, many times taller than a man, and normally bound by powerful Kido seals. Released from
these bindings at your command, the halberd transforms into a vast and fiery phoenix. Intent only
on a single victim with each summoning, it’s flames possess the power of a million Zanpakuto
already and it’s beak ten times that when piercing the intended criminal. Even accounting for
ordinary Zanpakuto in this multiplication, the firebird has more than enough power to vaporise even
a veteran Captain with ease. However, this immense power is only effective against the target it was
released against, even single Captain could block the phoenix’s beak with their sealed sword, albeit
with some difficulty. After completing it’s task, and it will chase down it’s target over great distances, the halberd will bind itself again for a time to rest."
193,600,Hollow Scythe,Bleach,Treasure,"Formerly a parasitic hollow that was broken, dominated, and transformed, this scythe acts as a
conduit for its wielder’s power and possesses the constitution of a powerful Hollow with its own, unique abilities. It appears twisted and white, with a doubled sided, red blade. Its first ability is
simply the manifestation energy charged rifts made by slashing the air, which expel massive waves
of destructive power. The scythe’s true worth however stems from its ability of ‘memory erasure.’ The scythe is able to seamlessly slide through anyone and anything (with the exception of spirit
energy infused objects like Zanpaktou) and in the process, erase memories possessed by the target. The wielder can selectively erase some or all of the a target’s memories, with anyone that memory is
connected too also suffering its effects. Erase one’s memory of their identity, and all who knew them, and all records of them, will also be erased. "
194,600,Ancient Prison,Bleach,Treasure,"Ikomikidomoe, an ancient hollow of the Adjuchas class, yet with power transcending even Arrancar
born from Vasto Lords. This was a monster that was able to defeat old Yamamoto and nearly devour
the Soul King some millennia ago, until it was stopped. By Ichibe Hyosube’s power, its name was
erased, and it was sealed within a sword to contain his power. The wielder of this sword would be
able to use it like a Zanpaktou, calling Ikomikidomoe’s power in various forms, but risked the sealed
Hollow’s ire, and hunger. If a moment of vulnerability were to appear, the wielder could be
devoured in an instant. You now find yourself in the possession of a similar weapon, one of your own
design, that contains an immensely powerful Hollow whose powers can be borrowed through the
calling of its name. It shall possess some unique ability like all Hollows, and its final release may be
used to temporarily join its power with your own. Beware abuse of the weapon however, as its host
can be irritable."
195,600,Charged Blade,Bleach,Treasure,"An immensely powerful construct resembling a sword. Developed by Urahara in a year’s time under
normal circumstances, this sword houses an immense amount of spiritual energy contributed by the
captains of the Gotei 13, among other Shinigami. However, despite the form it takes, and the
incredible power it houses, this is not a weapon. This is tool used to bestow the power of a Shinigami
to a human, originally used to completely restore a once crippled Ichigo’s powers. A human who was
never a Shinigami would not obtain Shikai or Bankai, but would have immense power as a Shinigami
bestowed upon them. Someone who was once a Shinigami, but lost their powers, would instantly be
returned to their full power and then some. Simply stab the sword in your target of choice, and the
sword will break apart and bestow its power unto them. You will obtain a new “Charged Blade” each
Jump, and in future worlds it will obtain the additional functionality of being able to restore any kind
of lost power that the stabbed individual once had."
196,600,Skull Clad,Bleach,Treasure,"The favour of Hell is a strange thing to collect and many would question what exactly the intentions of one so deeply connected to it’s Will are. However it came to be, golden light coalesced around your form into an armor made from human bones, shining with sinful light. This armor represents the invested power of the Kushanada, the caretaker’s of Hell, and thus your own authority in that realm. The most obvious result is an increase in spiritual power, reinforcing your soul with the energy of hell, similar to maintaining a Shikai or Resurreccion state while the armor is summoned. More interesting are the hellish abilities you have access to. You can travel freely to and from Hell, summoning the Gates to enter the place and then exit again anywhere the realm might have reach. You can both create and command the chains of hell as well as summon the Kushanada. The chains are near unbreakable even to a Captain level opponent and can bind the spiritual energy of others or drag them down into hell, if the Gate is active. The Kushanada are gigantic gorilla-like demons who guard Hell and torment it’s prisoners, each one more than a match for any Vice Captain Shinigami. The permanent investment of power you have received also gives you the same immortality as the Togabito, slowly reforming in Hell if you are ever killed. Unless your soul is completely destroyed, you will reappear in a few days in your realm. You’ll retain access to the Hell of this world in future, though the sinners of the past worlds will be left behind, and can attempt to claim similar influence over other Hells. If you can convince it’s guards to invest their power or conquer them yourself, at least."
197,600,Split Soul Katana,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"One of the strongest cursed tools, the Split Soul Katana is a rather unassuming single-edged blade, with the white fur upon its guard being its only real distinguishing quality. The blade’s unique property is that it ignores the physical toughness of any substance it strikes in order to directly cut the soul. While its said to be strongest in the hands of those who can see the souls of inorganic matter, such as those with zero cursed energy, its power is incredible regardless. The bodies of even the toughest cursed spirits would be like paper before it, and the damage to the soul will make it much more difficult to recover from their injuries than normal."
198,600,Inverted Spear of Heaven ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"Despite what its name like imply, this special grade cursed tool takes the form of a dagger with an unusual, two-pronged blade. Imbued with an unusually potent cursed technique, it has the ability to nullify any cursed technique its blade comes into contact with. No matter how powerful it is, the technique will be forcibly ended and suppressed the moment the blade comes into contact with its cursed energy. It doesn’t hurt that the actual dagger portion of the blade is perfectly functional despite its odd shape, cutting through flesh and cursed energy with equal ease."
199,600,Prison Realm,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"A red, fleshy cube, each face covered in ever-staring eyes, Prison Realm is an unusual thing made from the body of the monk Genshin. A special grade cursed object, it has a power worthy of that ranking: the ability to seal anyone, imprisoning them within a pocket dimension within itself, from which escape from the inside is impossible. That said, there are quite a few steps needed to get Prison Realm to activate.

First, the user must chant a short incantation to open Prison Realm, causing it to expand into a mass of meat as tall as a man, stretched out between four cubic corners with a bleeding, unblinking eye in the very centre. Once opened, whoever you wish to seal must be kept within a four-metre radius of it for one minute – though, notably, this doesn’t have to be a minute in real time: just a minute from the perception of the target. As such, someone reminiscing about a series of events in the past can cause it to trigger, even if mere moments passed in the real world.

As soon as this condition is met, Prison Realm morphs into a set of cubes surrounding the target, from which sinewy protrusions instantaneously shoot forth to bind to their body. This not only completely restrains the target, preventing them from moving or breaking free, but also renders them unable to use cursed energy, or any other supernatural abilities for that matter. The only step that remains is a final short incantation, causing the Prison Realm to snap shut and return to its original form, sealing the target within.

The pocket dimension inside of the cursed object is little more than an impossibly deep pit lined with endless amounts of skeletal remains. Though the sealed target always remains conscious, time does not pass in that place – they do not age at all, and the only way they can die is if they take their own life.

There are only two ways to release someone from the Prison Realm: one, if the owner of it wills the person sealed within to be released. Two, if it is targeted by an effect that nullifies cursed techniques. Otherwise, it is wholly inviolable and indestructible. 

While it being targeted by a cursed technique nullifying effect will destroy it, if such a thing happens you will receive a new copy after ten years or at the start of the next Jump, whichever comes first."
200,600,Special Grade Cursed Tool(600),Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"By purchasing this option, you receive a cursed tool imbued with one of the abilities from the cursed technique section, allowing you to wield it through this item. The exact form of your cursed tool, as well as how it specifically interacts with the cursed technique it carries, is up to you. Perhaps you have a megaphone that allows you to use Cursed Speech when talking through it, a shamisen imbued with Boogie Woogie that switches people’s places when played, or a sword that slowly leaks blood that its wielder can control as if by Blood Manipulation. As long as its effects are related to the original technique – and don’t exceed it in power or ignore its limitations – it should be possible.

The price for such an object is equal to the original cost of the cursed technique.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
201,600,Playful Cloud,Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"As a rule, all special grade cursed tools are imbued with a cursed technique. Playful Cloud is the exception that proves it. A three-section staff consisting of red staves connected by short metal chains, it’s a weapon that forgoes any special ability for something simple: acting as a force multiplier for the user, allowing them to hit with far more force than they could usually exert. A sorcerer with slightly superhuman strength, for instance, would be able to hit a special grade cursed spirit and send them flying through the air despite their attempts to resist. 

Given this effect, the naturally stronger the user is, the better this weapon will be in their hands, potentially making it effective no matter how powerful one gets."
202,600,True Apocrypha ,Tsukihime,Treasure,"The Spear Key and Gun Shield, also known as the Holy Shield Gamaliel.It is a Conceptual Weapon that resembles a violin, a spear, and a shield merged together. While A little bit unwieldy, it is nonetheless a potent weapon against both Dead Apostles and similarities, its true power is how it defends the wielder. The person holding this weapon would be protected from alterations in the world’s ‘rules’, making them immune to being influenced by a Reality Marble or similar outside forces, and the shield is also a potent defense against both Magic and Mystery, supernatural attacks unable to shatter or dent the shield - though the force and heat of attacks could still harm the user. Your mind and existence are protected by holy light, Jumper - use it well.
"
203,600,Barrel Replica ,Tsukihime,Treasure,"A copy of the greatest weapon in the armory of the Alchemists of Atlas. Its Progenitor is a conceptual weapon, composed of the mysterious Fifth True Theoretical Element,that will one day be wielded by a normal human to slay the Ultimate One of Venus in a single shot. While this is not that terrible weapon, the Barrel Replica is still a thing to be feared. It Enforces the idea of mortality on your foes by putting out a 'toxin' which has attack power in proportion to that being’s natural lifespan. Truly immortal beings will not be slain by this,though most will find it painful enough that their abilities and form may be stunted considerably with enough damage. As a rule, if it doesn't need a body to survive this weapon can't kill them. The wounds it inflicts will heal at the pace of a normal human being regardless of how fast it would normally heal. At its highest output you will need to anchor the weapon,else it will simply blow its way out of your hands and through whatever is behind it. You may use it in its current form as a pistol, have it reforged into a weapon of your choice, incorporate it into a weapon from a previous jump.
"
204,600,Pacho Fan,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"A large, green Gunbai, a Japanese war fan. This is the famed weapon of King Uma, one of the 9 Kings of the Sage Realm and is a powerful weapon. Your copy can only be utilised by yourself, being nothing more than a tough fan when in the hands of another. It has immense powers of air manipulation and even a half-hearted swing can destroy an entire castle as well as slice through a city, splitting it into two halves. When swung with great force, it creates a tornado large and fast enough to tear whole cities apart, whilst creating a complete vacuum of air within the tornado. You are under no protection from the lack of air so be careful how you use this legendary weapon."
205,600,Monkey King’s Blood,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"You’ve discovered a small vial of a mysterious red substance. This vial contains the blood of the Monkey King’s clone and can grant the powers, in a limited fashion, to those who drink or are injected with it. This sample has been perfected as compared to the flawed model used by the Americans in the God of High school Tournament’s second last stage. The blood grants greatly increased size and physical abilities, especially strength and speed, such that you could make a small island shake with just the force of your punches. It also grants a limited capacity to clone yourself. These clones possess all your abilities, weapons and armour, but not any items and the further they get from a close area to you, the weaker they become. You are only able to create one clone at first but in time you might slowly extend this to a few handfuls more. You will gain a new vial of Monkey King’s Blood each year, though using it on the same person twice will have no new effects."
206,600,Three Imperial Regalia,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"A set of three legendary artefacts from Japan. The Kusanagi Sword, Yata’s Mirror and the Yasakani no Magatama. The Kusanagi Sword is a powerful magical blade that is able to summon gigantic snakes from any wound it creates in another being, which will proceed to attack them. Yata’s Mirror summons a gigantic mirror like shield which will provide absolute protection from all but the strongest attacks before breaking and quickly reform in a few minutes whenever it breaks. The Magatama, a necklace of small objects, are able to work as powerful elemental explosives, unleashing a storm of whatever element the colour of the Magatama represents and they slowly replenish over the course of a day."
207,600,Brahmastra,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Treasure,"The greatest of gifts, mightiest of the gods’ weapons. The Brahmastra in it’s many forms comes to
rest in your hands, the ultimate divine weapon against demons. A weapon that can take on any form
of weapon needed by the wielder, it is a tool for punishing those that go against Heavens’ will. Even
the mightiest of Divine Spirits will find their bodies cleaving before the stroke of this blade and the
most terrible demon kings quail when targeted by the Bramastra in arrow form. More so then, as
the weapon is both enormously potent against demons and far more powerful when used in ranged
form. Individually, it would allow opposing a threat well beyond your normal level but a ranged blow
against a demon could bring low even the greatest evils in a few strikes. 

Becoming connected to you, the Brahmastra will return to your being when called, stored away
within your soul when not needed for combat. This connection also allows you to channel magical
energy and powers through the weapon, acting as a magnifier for such things against your enemies. Even a modest fireball could turn into raging torrents from the sword of the gods."
208,600,Trishula Shakti,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Treasure,"The three pronged trident of the King of the Gods. Avatar of creation, existence and destruction, it is
a weapon without peer. The spear itself releases it’s true power when held in your hands, having the
destructive force to shatter planets and destroy whole worlds with a thrust or throw. Each of it’s
points confers a unique power relating to the trinity of existence, used as you desire.

The first point represents Destruction and releases divine lightning on command. This lightning
unmakes whatever it comes into contact with, short of a fully enlightened Buddha or God of solar
scale. What is destroyed by this lightning is done so completely, impossible to bring back short of a
reality changing miracle, such as a wish from a Holy Grail or the act of a Bodhisattva of great power. Physical material, magical spells, even the fabric of the world that creates a texture can all be
undone. The lightning moves to your will, like gentle waves or a raging storm, guided to every target
by thought. 

The second point is lesser, not so deeply represented by Shiva’s aspects, but still potent. Maintenance of reality that allows the spear to reinforce reality as it is, greatly hindering attempts to
change it. From magic to authority to mundane methods, the trident can be planted on the ground
and extreme resistance to change in the world you are currently in, preventing reality from being
altered or commanded by others without immense power. 

Finally, creation as the third point. When holding the spear, you may cast your own magic through
the trident and out of this final point. The process immensely improves the power of such things,
increasing them to hundreds of times their normal strength. It becomes a tool to aid the shaping of
the world around you, creating and manipulating using your own knowledge with the trident as a
tool."
209,600,True Steel,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Treasure,"The pride and joy of one of the greatest swordsmiths in history. While without decoration, the sword
in your hands is among the most potent and valuable in all of Japan. A perfect katana, whose quality
and specifications appear to have been molded to fit your body and style specifically. Even a novice
with this in hand would feel like they could move as a master does. The blade itself cuts without
hesitation or restriction when swung with the intent to do so, allowing it to cut through not just any
physical matter but even non-physical presences and concepts. Spirits die as easily as mortal men to
the sword and the barriers between worlds or dimensions can be sliced open with a flick of the wrist. Combined with the skill to strike at conceptual ideas without this sword, it can even allow for
outright destruction of what you attack, instead of merely severing it.
 
The legendary sword will not break no matter the pressures you put it through, always adapting to
your body and fighting style to remain a true partner in battle. In the thick of it, the sheer power that
radiates off the sword can even create an aura around you, shining red and gold."
210,600,Curruid Coinchenn,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Treasure,"The dreaded body of the beast from which Gae Bolg, the thorny spear of death, was made has now
been harvested and reformed into a strange but very powerful suit of armour. Covering most of your
body but leaving the chest and face bare, though it does include a hood, Curruid Coinchenn is a
partially living armour that wards away even the blows of magical spears like Gae Bolg, while also
massively magnifying the strength and endurance of the one who wields it, such that they would be
at least ten times as strong as they originally were. It even heals the wearer at a significant pace of
any injuries they take on. The armour is covered in cursed spikes, similar to Gae Bolg itself, which
deliver wounds that will not heal naturally or through weaker magical means. Finally, when activated
in full, the armour will fully cover your body and turn you into a rampaging beast, amplifying your
physical abilities even further and letting you extend and fire off the spear-like implements in your
body, though they do not have the strange powers Gae Bolg has."
211,600,Promised Victory,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Treasure,"There’s no shame in adoring the legend of King Arthur. A famous tale known across the globe and
for good reason. That shining knight symbolised victory to all who fought on the battlefield, particularly so to their English descendants, and nowhere is that more purely expressed than the
golden sword Excalibur. Your own obsession with the Once and Future King was such that it called
on part of this legend, the myth of the sword, and made it part of your very being. 

Any tool you hold can become Excalibur. Or at least, a version of it. The golden sword manifests at
your command from your weapon, be it a stick or a sword of great magical power in it’s own right. It
works almost identically to the holy sword, able to convert magical energy into greatly magnified
heat and light, resulting in an annihilating laser blast or slash. The quality of Excalibur will depend on
the base tool you used to manifest it and many tools will crumble from the strain. A stick’s maximum
power could still split thick trees in two before turning to ash but a sturdy sword might leave a large
theatre ruined from a half hearted slash of light. The limitation is that, as mighty as your power can
be, it can never truly match the original Excalibur’s scale, even with the greatest of base tools. "
212,600,Rhongomyniad,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Treasure,"The lance that shines to the end of the world, one of the two great artefacts held by King Arthur. This lance is now in your possession, as a copy of the one that the King will come to hold. This
weapon is just a reflection of a much greater construct, a pillar that holds apart the two sides of the
world. That of reality and the side where mystery, gods and phantasmal beasts makes their home. As a lance, it can pierce any armour and strike through any defence. By calling out it’s name, one can
even release a blast of light sourced from the pillar it represents, an incredibly powerful attack. However, the lance is restricted by the same 13 Rules that bind Excalibur, limiting it’s power unless
used in the right conditions. If the lance were to be broken, the two sides of the world would
combine into one, filling the world back up with all kinds of fantasy. In fact, Rhon retains this quality
even in future worlds, allowing you to break the lance to fill the world with magic, myths and
mystery appropriate to it. The lance will be restored at the beginning of your next jump and if
repaired while in the same jump as it was broken in, it will separate the worlds once more."
213,600,Sturdy Spear,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Treasure,"A humble weapon, with none of the status of the sword, is the spear. But to those that devote
themselves to this versatile tool, they discover a depth few weapons possess. You’ve gone quite a
few steps further. The spear became the target of a religious obsession, a fanatical drive to master it
to the utmost. It paid off with a mastery that verges on the realm of godliness, such pure skill with
the spear that it has changed your very being. If it weren’t for their lesser reputation, you’d be
remembered alongside the likes of Musashi and Munetori for your military talents. The divine nature
of your skill greatly increases your physical power, smashing down whole dojo buildings in a single
swing of your staff is a great way to teach these sword using brats a thing or two. The focus you’ve
achieved when wielding a spear allows you to ignore most attempts at interfering with your mind, the bloodthirst of your foes being so evident to your purified mind that it allows you to move before
most of them can finish the thought of attacking you. 

Nothing else demonstrates your mastery more than your ability to respond to any enemy or
technique however. Even on your first encounter, you can adapt your style to whatever you
encounter with a few moments consideration, letting you counter even truly bizarre things that
should not be matched with a simple spear. Cutting apart magical spells, piercing a spirit’s core, turning aside the three thousand bullets of your foe. While your ability to create martial arts to
respond to any challenge is impressive, and possible to expand beyond the realm of a spear with
some work, it can require enough power to keep up with your foe to some degree. Too far beyond you and even all your skill will falter. Additionally, these techniques are often partially effective at
first, requiring time to hone to full mastery before you can fully negate or counter their intended
target.

You may optionally exchange the parts of this perk that focus on spears with another fairly specific
weapon type. You can’t have it for all swords or anything you do while unarmed but longswords, halberds, nunchuks or a specific martial art style can all work. "
214,600,Fish Oil,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Treasure,"Through a miracle of breaking the rules, Fionn was not the only boy to get the first bite of the
legendary Salmon of Knowledge, the fish that contained all the world’s wisdom. You found yourself
with a replica of the fish and ate it whole, from head to toe for yourself too. Thus, you gained all the
wisdom of the world, even if it is concentrated in your thumb. By biting your thumb, you are able to
connect your mind to a seemingly endless repository of knowledge, containing all the information
that exists in this world. Like a mental library, you can search through it just by thinking but also like
a library, it takes time to find information and time to read through it as well, plus you will not
automatically memorize what you see there. But with the patience of a good lord, you can find out
anything you wish, within the limits of this world."
215,600,Presence,Cradle,Treasure,"A Magical AI that ties itself to your Soul. It's sapient, but not technically a
Companion as it's a part of you. Capable of doing things like projecting near-perfect predictions
of how someone will fight after seeing enough data on them, offloading parts of your
subconscious into itself in order to make you a more efficient fighter, handling mentally
controlled weapons for you, and storing vast quantities of information instantly inside of itself.
Your choice if your Presence acts more like Dross or an official Abidan Presence (If they have
an actual personality or if they're just a Robotic Voice)."
216,600,Book of Eternal Night,Cradle,Treasure,"The Artifact Path Manual created by Akura Malice herself, and
given to her Daughter. It contains seven techniques that form the ""Perfect"" Shadow Path, taking
from several other Shadow Paths and blending them together into a toolkit of extreme power
and utility. You need only cultivate Shadow Aura into yourself, and the Book handles any other
aspects from it's varying techniques for you. In order to train on the Path provided with this, you
will need to be tested within the Book itself, and bind it to your Soulspace. If the Akuras find out
you somehow have a copy of this thing, expect consequences. These techniques include ropes
of shadow that can be used to bind or manipulate yourself or allies, a blade of darkness that can
cut through just about any defense, a swelling dark tide of physical strength, a toxic, clinging
darkness that can melt through armor and flesh, and the ability to directly inflict fear onto an
enemy, causing them to lose focus."
217,600,Empire Armor,Cradle,Treasure,"Two sets of armor, when worn by you and a partner, or any two
people for that matter, they allow you to link your different magical and spiritual powers together
and access each other's abilities, including each other's Paths or your Jumper Abilities if they
apply. If you were to get four sets of this and link them all together, you would achieve what the
Eight-Man Empire has: Eight people, Sages and Heralds all, matching the strength of one
Monarch. Of course, replicating this set of suits would be difficult, but it is possible. What has
been made once can be made again. Only this initial pair will be Fiat-Protected."
218,600,Sacred Treasures,Cradle,Treasure,"One each of all of the strongest Sacred Treasures -Artifacts that
contain the most potent forms of various Vital Auras- for every major Aspect. In case you
manage to drain one dry, it will replace itself after a month. These alone are enough to get most
Sacred Artists all the way to Archlord, at least on the power scales, and you need to balance the
Aura around you in order to progress into the Lord Stage at all."
219,700,Heavenly Kings,Saint Seiya Omega,Treasure,"This is one, if not the most elite armor that exists for mortals to wear. At
minimum, its power and durability are equivalent to that of three golden armors,
enabling the user to move faster than the speed of light and easily destroy any
divine-protected areas with ease. However, they will require a Cosmo level equal
to that of the Four Heavenly Kings of Mars to make this armor work."
220,800,Hōgyoku,Bleach,Treasure,"The Crumbling Orb at the centre of so much conflict. The magnum opus of both Sosuke Aizen and
Kisuke Urahara. Each man wished to find a way to break the boundaries of the spiritual world in
some way and, somehow, each found their way to the same creation. A device capable of realising
the deepest desires and dreams of those around it. Yet, this tool has a will of it’s own, an intelligent
to read the desires of others and serve the one considered it’s master. Whatever the truth of it’s intelligence, the completed Hōgyoku rests in your palm now, a fusion of
two component orbs and incredible power to bind them. It’s power is to manifest dreams as reality, not in a temporary sense or only maintained by focus but as truth. It could break down the barriers
between two races to create a new species, awaken powers in those that desperately desire or
evolve a man to ever greater levels of power. Indeed, these dreams manifest through evolution, change and growth in those affected. The orb requires a large amount of Reiryoku to activate, either injected in to activate in regards to a
single desire or constantly infused by being near a powerful source, allowing the orb to manifest
wishes as it sees fit. However, the orb manifests desires that people are capable of achieving. If one
does not have the raw potential or power to achieve something, the Hōgyoku will instead attempt to
lead it’s user towards being able to do so. They might be forcibly evolved in stages first to prepare
them for the true goal or be guided without realisation towards what is needed to gain the potential
for what they desire. The more powerful the user, in raw power and capability overall, the more the
Hōgyoku can achieve on it’s own."
221,800,Special Grade Cursed Tool(800),Jujutsu Kaisen,Treasure,"By purchasing this option, you receive a cursed tool imbued with one of the abilities from the cursed technique section, allowing you to wield it through this item. The exact form of your cursed tool, as well as how it specifically interacts with the cursed technique it carries, is up to you. Perhaps you have a megaphone that allows you to use Cursed Speech when talking through it, a shamisen imbued with Boogie Woogie that switches people’s places when played, or a sword that slowly leaks blood that its wielder can control as if by Blood Manipulation. As long as its effects are related to the original technique – and don’t exceed it in power or ignore its limitations – it should be possible.

The price for such an object is equal to the original cost of the cursed technique.

222,800,Blade of Tathagata,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"The sword of the Jade Emperor himself. A simple katana and matching sheath, neither with any embellishments or additions. This mighty blade possesses no innate power, save its limitless cutting edge. A single, lazy slash was able to slice all of South Korea in half and the blade was also able to destroy the cloned Ruyi Jingu Bang. It can summon gigantic waves of incredibly hot flame at the user’s command and even the sheath of the blade is powerful enough to split in half the super massive swords wielded by Nephilim without any action on the user’s behalf. Even if somehow broken, a feat only accomplished once by the Monkey King using over a hundred National Treasures and multiple Charyeok at once, the blade will be replenished to pristine condition within minutes."
223,800,Sovereign Treasure,A Will Eternal,Treasure,"This is a customisable artifact of some power. The Sovereign artifact, as implied by its name,
is something that Sovereign cultivators would seek out to use, let alone cultivators of a
weaker level. After flying through the void of space for untold years, it has come crashing
down in front of you as you enter the jump with nary a whisper of its appearance. Like the
Sovereign fan that will soon pass the Eternal Realm, its functionality will slowly by unlocked
as you complete challenges of appropriate difficulties. Its exact function is something you
should decide now, whether it be a weapon, a transport, a shield, or other. Whatever the
case, it is extremely strong, and likely large. As a sovereign level treasure, its function can
dip slightly into the domain of a Dao, like the hour glasses that affected the flow of time
around them. Its full power will only by fully unlocked when you reach the peak of Archaean
realm, or are of similar power."
224,800,The Hands of the Maker,Generic Exalted,Treasure,"You have gained a forbidden knowledge. A dusty tome has
come into your possession and within it dwell the secrets of producing Alchemical Exalted, one
of the greatest creations ever made by a Titan devoted to Craft. It could take a hundred mortal
lifetimes to glean even the barest secrets of this knowledge, though one who is Exalted above
others might manage it in as little as one. It contains instructions on how to make all the various
types of Alchemical Exalted and, unlike the Alchemicals that were first created, these
instructions show how to create improved versions. Ones that are immune to the dread sickness
that so afflicted the Maker and far less susceptible to the vagaries of Clarity. This is only the
knowledge to create these beings, and someone that desires to make use of this knowledge will
need to secure the materials, infrastructure, and other reagents needed on their own. The
Jumper, and only the Jumper, is guaranteed to one day be able to make Alchemical Exalts if
they study this, even if they wouldn't normally be capable of such, though it may take a very
long time indeed.
While you may discover the method of the creation of Alchemicals, how their Exaltation itself is
formed will elude you, no matter what method you attempt, until such time as you have gained
your Spark. Further you will discover that no method you are capable of will be able to utilize the
Alchemical Exaltation for anything other than powering the Alchemical that it has attached itself
to. This, too, will be something that will be beyond your comprehension until such a time as you
have gained your Spark. As a reminder Alchemicals were once people and while the process
may have changed them both in looks and abilities they are people still. So unless you take
them as companions, or have some other method of bringing them with you into future worlds,
you will not be able to take them with you. Finally the process of making an Alchemical does not
infuse into them any sort of loyalty to you, so beware if you have used this knowledge to force
this condition upon the unwilling."
225,900,God Warrior,Saint Seiya Omega,Treasure,"The God Cloth represents the ultimate form of armor worn by the gods in the
world. As only the twelve Olympians in Greek mythology were allowed to wear
such armor. It bestows immense power and protection, elevating mortals to
god-like levels of strength and durability. This legendary armor enhances combat
abilities, including increased speed, strength, and endurance. However, only
someone who has attained the Nine Senses can unleash its full power, making it
a coveted and formidable asset for those who possess the necessary cosmic
awareness and mastery."
226,1000,Monkey King’s Implements,The God of High School Jump,Treasure,"The great Monkey King had four mythical artefacts that accompanied him on his war against the Gods of Heaven and each of these are now made available to you for purchase, granting you perfect copies of the weapons that are loyal to only you. Each artefact is a separate purchase, though every purchase after the second is discounted to 500, for Demon origin takers and for non-demon origin takers.

The first and most famous. Ruyi Jingu Bang, also known as Yeoui. A silver Bo staff, it is imbued with many great abilities. It can change its length at the owners command, from being small enough to use as a toothpick or fit behind one’s ear to extending from the surface of the Earth to several times beyond the Moon, this change of distance happening almost instantaneously. The width and thickness of the staff may also increase at the user’s will, enlargening to stay proportional to its greater lengths. This lengthening power can be used in combat to blow through enemies, even piercing through and destroying whole planets. Its weight can also alter as the owner commands, becoming as light as air or so heavy that even Uriel, a Goddess who held up a planet with little issue, had her arms torn off by trying to hold it in the air. Yeoui returns to its masters hand when called, either teleporting back or flying towards them, destroying everything in its path as it travels at terrific speeds. The staff itself is almost completely indestructible, the only two beings who have managed to damage it being the First Prince of Natak, leader of the war gods, and the Jade Emperor using the Blade of Tathagata. One being, 666:Satan, was able to destroy the staff, but fear not as the implement will regenerate to its full health in a few hours of being broken.

Then there is the Kinto-Un. A cloud that the owner may call to their service, no matter where they are. It will even appear in the depths of space. This cloud can be used for transportation, travelling at absurd speeds even considered against the speeds achieved by Gods and Demons but its main purpose is the raw offensive power. It allows the user to manipulate storm related events, such as creating and controlling winds strong enough to hold up an entire continent, calling down an almost limitless number of lightning bolts with each able to damage even the powerful Gods of this world and being able to create fog so thick it cannot be seen or passed through except by the strongest of beings. However, the Kinto-Un is powered by the user’s life energy and abilities such as its lightning calling power will create a great drain on the power of the user.

Next is the Crimson Gourd. Taking the form of a small gourd, tiny enough to be fully held in one hand, it is able to absorb attacks and seal away monsters on a vast scale. The Gourd is nearly indestructible, with not even the First Prince of Natak scratching it, and is able to absorb any sort of energy attack fired at the user, with no discovered limit on how much it can store. The second use allows it to suck up and seal away monsters of every sort. In a single command of the wielder, it was able to suck up every single monkey in the Monkey Country of the Sage Realm at once and has no difficulty sealing monsters of almost any kind, though those of sufficient power can resist the call. Gods may also resist, whether through raw power or through being in their true forms.

Finally, the armour and garments of the Monkey King, Yongpyo. When not actively worn it takes the form of a shifting mass of black energy and when worn, it may take the appearance of any clothing the user desires. When worn as clothing, it is an armour unsurpassed by any form of defence save a Barbadium body, and is still capable of working as a powerful shield even when all combatants are flinging about attacks that can destroy whole worlds. The armour massively enhances all of the user’s physical abilities, propelling even a mortal to Godlike levels. It is partially sentient and acts to protect its master even when they are not aware of attacks, changing form to block attacks. The armour is also capable of at least two transformations, with possibly more to be discovered. The first is the Boost Mode, which creates wings and jets on the armour, multiplying the speed of the user several times over. The second is Power Mode, bulking the armour up greatly and in return granting a significant multiplier to the user’s strength. Yongpyo may also be loaned to other people or recalled in an instant.

Boosted: While purchasing these options will grant you the chosen implements as normal, it will now act as an immense boost in power to one of your own personal implements, one of the 2-4 things that you gained by taking the capstone booster. This boosted thing will vastly outmatch even the Monkey King's tools, which will be used for examples. The Ruyi Jingu Bang would become tough enough that even 666 Satan, the God who would eventually shatter it, could not even scratch it at his best and be capable of stretching from Earth to Pluto in an instant. The Kinto-Un would make its’ original speed seem like molasses while being able of summoning lightning that can shatter large parts of a planet with each individual bolt whilst the winds it brings could scour a planet to dust in a minute at tops. The Crimson Gourd could store any matter at all, sucking away even entire planets to store within its’ depths until recalled. The user would also gain great power over the space within, becoming able of warping it almost as desired, though not entirely limitless. Yongpyo would become many hundreds or even thousands of times more durable and gain not only vastly increased transformations but several addition ones, boosting various other traits of the user. Whatever your implement may be, it receives a similarly massive boost. You can optionally choose to simply boost the Monkey King Implement you received instead of boosting one of your own.

Boost Requires Reincarnation(High God) to Activate
