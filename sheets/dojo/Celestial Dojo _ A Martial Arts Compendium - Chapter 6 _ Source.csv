1,Free,Sei Kior Dou Ki,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Source,"Ki is the life force, energy or breath that flows through all living things. Martial artists harness
their Ki to perform amazing feats of strength and abilities, with master's able to channel their Ki
into effects that are truly superhuman. In this world Ki can be categorized into two distinct
varieties.
Sei­ Those who utilize Sei Ki seek to focus their Ki inwards. In battle this results in an inner
calm and centeredness that lends itself well to thoughtful action and awareness of surroundings.
Those who have Sei Ki will be able to master techniques that do not rely on power or anger but
on wits, talent and skill. Sei users will be more likely to come up with new inventive solutions in
combat and will frequently have moments of insight that may turn an unwinnable battle in their
favor.
Dou­ Those who utilize Dou Ki seek to focus it outwards. In battle they are able to channel their
emotions into their fighting style, allowing themselves greater speed and strength than their Sei
counterparts. Those who have Dou Ki will be able to accelerate their perception and processing
speed to react and counter attacks before they are themselves aware of it. Dou users are more
likely to gain sudden bursts of strength and power at crucial moments, channeling tension and
anxiety into raw power."
2,Free,Cosmo,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Source,"Cosmo is an ancient energy that sleeps within human beings, that traces its
origin back to the Big Bang that created the universe in an ancient time before time. One who is
aware of their Cosmo can ‘burn’ it, recreating the Big Bang in an extremely miniature scale
within their own bodies, to perform superhuman feats or unleash great destructive power within
a single, contained point. Someone who has awakened to and trained their Cosmo can burn it
to do things such as moving faster than the speed of sound, pulverize boulders, as well as
withstand bodily punishment along those same lines.
This is the level you start at."
3,Free,Cosmo,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Source,"The Big Bang gave birth to everything, every bit of energy and every grain of matter, everywhere in the universe. As a being made of it, it is legitimate to think of yourself as a little universe, able to recreate this miracle on your own scale… That is the philosophy behind Cosmo : ""little universe"", something inside you that, when ""burned"", recreates that energy and allows extraordinary things to happen. You have a beginner cosmo, alike to that of a Bronze Saint. Burning your cosmo alone or with your armor will see you do things like move at Mach 1, pulverise boulders barehanded, or punch 100 times in a second. It is only the beginning however, for there is no end for those who cultivate this gift… "
4,Free,Cosmo,Saint Seiya Omega,Source,"Cosmo, an ancient energy slumbering within every human being, traces its
origins to the primordial explosion that birthed the universe in a time before time
itself. Patiently awaiting ignition, this potent force lies dormant, ready to be
kindled into a miraculous power. Those who unlock access to their Cosmo
possess the ability to ignite and harness it, unleashing superhuman feats and
tapping into supernatural abilities.
With a beginner's Cosmo akin to that of a Bronze Saint, one can begin their
journey of mastery over this formidable energy. Through training and discipline,
individuals can learn to ignite their Cosmo, unleashing its power to achieve
extraordinary feats. From moving faster than the speed of sound to pulverizing
boulders with sheer force, the possibilities are as vast as the cosmos itself.
Moreover, those attuned to their Cosmo can endure bodily punishment beyond
ordinary limits, standing resilient against formidable adversaries and emerging
unscathed from the fiercest of battles."

7,Free,Trait,Reincarnator,Source,"In this world where mana exists, something awoken

8,Free,Cultivation,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Source,"In this world, people use the art of cultivation to increase their powers. This
practice is mostly divided into two ranks: Ki refiners, who generally rely on magical techniques
and treasures to fight, powered by the Elemental Essences they absorb, and Fiendgod Body
Refiners, who strive to turn their bodies into those of the ancient Fiendgods and utilize divine
abilities with vastly varying effects, such as increasing their size, adding extra arms, or even
strengthening their bodies beyond their already impressive levels, making their physical abilities
and general battle prowess much higher than those of a Ki refiner in exchange for lacking the
ability to use treasures and weapons. Thus you get a technique from each of these two types of
cultivation to study. Be warned though, that although Fiendgod Body Refiners are much more
powerful, their ways of cultivation may be painful to the extreme, or extremely hard to advance in,
resulting in decades of effort for just a bit of progress.
There are many stages to cultivation, starting with the Houtian Stage, which signals the very start
of a journey, as well as the increase of a cultivator’s lifespan to over a hundred years. Then comes
the Xiantian Stage, where the body is completely reforged for perfection, and the cultivator’s
lifespan increases to over two hundred years. The third stage is called Zifu, in which the
practitioner forms their own “Violet Palace” which contains their liquified Ki energy, and enables
them to live over four hundred years. The fourth stage, called Wanxiang, is the stage of
manifestation, where the practitioner gains access to Divine Will, and increases their lifespan to
eight hundred years. The fifth stage, called Primal, gives the practitioner the ability to live forever*
(not actually forever)*, with no limits on their lifespan After that comes the Void or Earth
Immortal Stage. When a practitioner reaches the Void Stage and attempts to progress to the next
level. they shall be met with a final Tribulation. This is a test sent down by the heavens in the form
of heavenly wind, fire, and lightning strikes that they must either bear or face total soul
annihilation. Then they must pass a test of their Dao Heart in the form of the Demonheart
Tribulation, where they shall be tested to see if they are truly dedicated in the matters of
Cultivation, and whether they are willing to abandon everything for its sake, though it can be
resisted with a powerful Heartforce. If they succeed in this Tribulation, they shall reach the
Celestial Immortal Stage, or, in the case of Body Refiners, the Empyrean God Stage, where they
shall break free of the mortal coil and the five elements. After that, there are two more stages for
both paths of Cultivation: True Immortal for Ki Refiners, or True God for Body Refiners, and then
Daofather for Ki Refiners, and Elder God for Body Refiners. Finally, there is the very pinnacle of

power in the Three Realms, the World level. This is the level of cultivation Pangu was at when he
created the Pangu Chaosworld, and Nuwa similarly reached. While there are even higher levels of
power to be grasped, they need not be mentioned for now, and you won’t be able to reach them
during this jump.
On a final note, once every three hundred years after a practitioner steps into the Zifu Realm, they
will be met with a minor tribulation, which will build up in power until finally, they shall face one
major tribulation every nine hundred years. Three centuries a Tribulation, nine a Calamity, this
shall continue until they either reach the Celestial Immortal stage, or have their souls shattered. For
the purposes of this perk you’ll be given a technique in both Body Refining and Ki Refining that
will last you until the Wanxiang Stage, at which point you’ll have to fend for yourself. For 50 CP
you can get one that will allow you to advance to the Celestial Immortal and Empyrean God level,
using both types of cultivation. Regardless of whether you buy the technique that allows you to
train to the Celestial Immortal/Empyrean God level or not, the technique you get is of the highest
quality, and you won’t need to worry about your future growth being crippled by using it. Your
cultivation technique may be aligned towards whatever Dao you wish it to be."
9,Free,Jujutsu(Base),Jujutsu Kaisen,Source,"In this world, all but a few humans possess a form of spiritual energy known as cursed energy, which is produced when feeling negative emotions such as anger, fear, or grief. Most humans, however, they have no control over this energy. As such, it leaks freely from their body, causing it to congregate and coalesce into cursed spirits. There are an incredibly rare few who are born with the ability to control this cursed energy, though – people known as sorcerers.

You are now one of these sorcerers, granting you the ability to manipulate your own cursed energy. While you aren’t capable of anything particularly special with this alone, there are a good number of benefits to this. For one, you are able to perceive cursed spirits and other spiritual entities with your senses, something usually impossible for non-sorcerers without specialised tools. Additionally, you’re able to channel this cursed energy into your body to enhance your physical abilities to superhuman levels, with greater results coming from greater investments. 

The above are but the most basic of uses of cursed energy – for more specialised and powerful ones, you’ll need cursed techniques. With this alone, you’re capable of some basic barrier techniques, which let you create (often spherical) walls of cursed energy to close off an area. The most common form of this is a curtain: a large, pitch black sphere that prevents those outside the barrier from seeing what’s happening within. Barriers can also be hardened to make entry or exit more difficult, though be aware that the more difficult it is to leave a barrier, the easier it is to enter and vice versa. In addition, you also have the capability to summon shikigami: creatures resembling cursed spirits created from your cursed energy. These require an intermediary such as a talisman to summon, tend to be rather straightforward in terms of abilities, and won’t be particularly strong, though this may be changed with some practice.

Unfortunately, aside from barriers and simple shikigami most cursed techniques are innate, and as such cannot be learned. It’s also entirely possible for a sorcerer to be born without a cursed technique, and as such you will not receive one from this alone. The Cursed Technique section later on will allow you to purchase one for yourself, though certain other, riskier methods may also allow you to obtain one.

Perhaps unexpectedly, the amount of cursed energy a sorcerer has is also something determined at birth. By default, you have a rather good talent for jujutsu, granting you a respectable reserve of cursed energy which will replenish by itself. This is more than enough to stand on the same level as the majority of sorcerers, though there are a fair few who still dwarf you in the size of their reserves."
10,Free,Cultivation,Beware Of Chicken,Source,"In a world of Cultivators, it's not surprising you would wish to be one. But
sadly, you are in the Azure Hills, becoming a Cultivator at all, let alone a
powerful one, is rarer around these parts. Maybe you could look into why.
Regardless, for Free you have the potential to become a Cultivator, you are
not even the First Stage of the Initiate’s Realm but you hold the potential to
be so one day, all it takes is something to ignite your Dantian to start your
path. If you want to skip over that, you may pay 100 CP to start as 1st
Stage of Initiate Realm. You also get to pick your Cultivation Style as
appropriate. Every additional 100 CP moves you up one Stage. See Notes

Forge your own Path here."
13,Free,Cultivation,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Source,"The basic ability to grow in power, which forms the bedrock of civilization around here. You
are now a real, proper Cultivator, and a rather good one at that. While nothing that would be all
that notable, being honest, you have excellent potential and talent for cultivation, good enough
to stand out among any crowd of common cultivators.
What is unusual is that you will be able to cultivate past the ninth level of Qi Condensation to
the true peak at the thirteenth level naturally and without problems.
After this jump you will be able to awaken the potential to cultivate in others with an effort of
will."
14,Free,Cultivation,A Will Eternal,Source,"The cultivation path of this world is based on Will itself. This becomes most apparent in the
higher levels of cultivation. There are two sources of cultivation. The first is spiritual energy,
which, while abundant in the Eternal Domain, is much sparser in the Heavenspan world.
This is what is used by the river sects in the Heavenspan world, and by the cultivators in the
Saint-Emperor’s domain. The other is Soul Vitality, absorbed from the souls of the dead,
primarily used by the cultivators of the Wildlands and Vile-Emperor’s domain. By taking in
this energy, you will slowly grow more powerful, and your lifespan will increase each time
you advance a stage. Separate from both of those, is body cultivation. This focuses on
raising the strength of the fleshy body and vital energy of the cultivator. You will start at the
level of qi condensation."

16,Free,Battle Aura,Mushoku Tensei,Source,"A warrior has an ability to coat their whole body or a specific part of their body in Mana or magical
energy, forming a dense mantle of energy known as Battle Aura. This can be done when someone reaches a
sufficient level of development in their body and skills while some unconsciously use it. In your case, you
instinctively know how to use it and it passively coats your entire body and clothes from the get-go. This allows
you to explosively boost strength, speed, durability, reaction times, spatial awareness and magic resistance
along with the ability to strengthen your weapon and perform unbelievable techniques and even resisting harsh
conditions like extreme heat and cold is also possible. By default you have the talent to reach Saint-Rank within
three years on your own at bare minimum, but with a proper teacher and learning environment you may reach
God-Rank in a decade along with having the instinctive ability to use and wield the Beginner-Rank techniques
of the Three Sword-Styles. You also gained the ability to grant the ability to use the Battle Aura of this world to someone
that doesn't have it. The people that you grant the Battle Aura/Magic System would gain a talent that allows
them to reach Saint-Rank within three years on their own at bare minimum, but those with a proper teacher and
learning environment may reach God-Rank in a decade granted they only focus on either becoming a Warrior or
Magician and not both, if not it would take much longer reach God-Rank. By default those who you grant this
ability gain an effect similar to Laplace Factor, which allows them to improve their Mana Reserves so long they
train and continue to deplete their Mana Reserves and they also have the ability to pass Battle Aura to their children and their descendants. You can also grant the same ability/talent to people who lack it
in this jump."
17,100,Sense Atum,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Source,"Atum. The fire that exists in all beings with a soul. Used in many martial arts, it is called “life-force” on some worlds. And you can use it to your advantage. You can sense the Atum (or life-force, in other jumps) of other beings, even through stone or dirt, but not metal of any kind. The further away, the more muddled they are. But hey, it's better than nothing."
18,100,Looking Down Upon You,Saint Seiya Episode G,Source,"Tis only rightful that a mortal bows to the greater Gods of this world. All you're doing is making it obvious that they should do such. You are capable of making known your true power, or just a portion of it, to any who look upon you or come near to you. The physical effects or costs of releasing your true power are not required, thus allowing you to impress exactly how superior you are to any around you at your full power without needing to shame yourself with the release of your true form to a mere mortal."
19,100,It's Only Natural,Saint Seiya Episode G,Source,"The Dunamis was within you from the moment you were born. It was not something that needed to be awakened for you like Cosmo but instead as innate to you as it is to blink or breathe. Being a natural part of you, you find yourself easily mastering its use and the use of things in a similar vein.

Whenever you are dealing with some kind of power or energy that is a natural part of your being, you'll find yourself mastering the use of it and control of it much faster than anyone else in your situation. You'd be on the level of the adults with ease, even before aging beyond the level of a child."
20,100,Divine Power,Feng Shen Ji,Source,"When a young God comes of age, much like how humans go through puberty, they have what’s called a Divine Revelation (usually around half-a-century old). A time when their bodies awaken their power. If not watched over by an experienced elder, these Divine Revelations can turn deadly as the young God’s ability begins to go wild;  firing off wildly and consuming any available energy to fuel itself. You may either pick which power you want or roll a D8 for a random Divine Power and receive +200CP. All aspects of the Divine Power scale with the user as they practice their abilities and get stronger innately. This innate power can be passed down to any of your descendants if you wish too though it cannot be taught.
	--1. Monochrome: 
One of the rarest Divine Powers, with only two known users. At its core, this 
Divine Power is all about control, allowing its users to utilize both their skills and 
powers at any intensity at will or just turning off/on any powers too. Only having 
an active ability, an AOE effect that does one of three abilities: suppresses the physical attributes of others, suppressing the supernatural abilities of others, or an absolute erosion effect (this caustic aura affects matter, energy, and the spiritual). You start off with enough proficiency for the suppression effect at 25% of others’ capabilities, with the erosion effect equally as potent. For an undiscounted 100CP cost, you can choose another medium to manifest your ability through (either by sight or imbuement into items) and another effect to be unleashed with Monochrome. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost you get both all activation methods (AOE, sight, imbuement) and all abilities of Monochrome available to
for you to play with. 
           --2. Indestructible:
One of the more well rounded abilities granted to the Gods. At its core, this 
Divine Power passively grants the user bodily mastery, always aware of the state 
of their own body while able to exert/dial the strength or speed of their body 
however they please. When active this power doubles all of the user’s physical 
attributes, making it so practitioners rarely need to rely on weapons or armors; 
and even going a step further to boost a specific physical attribute up to 5 times 
as if they were sprinting (strength, speed, or constitution/endurance) both the 
active time of usage and the magnitude of the boosts provided will increase in 
time and training. Some users have found they can extend this powerup to their 
own items or to other people with the same type of boost; with even more 
esoteric users just channeling their Divine Power to enhance their will to 
suppress others (making it a very washdown version of Divine Power - 
Monochrome). You can choose one subsection’s aspect (either one superior 
physical boost or other enhancement) or you can pay an undiscounted 100CP to 
have access to both subsections with one aspect from each side. With a total of 
200CP undiscounted cost you will have access to all aspects of this power.
	--3. Seer's Vision: 
Those born with this power are not usually warriors but tacticians or manipulators. At its core, this Divine Power enhances the vision of the user for 20/20 vision. Its active ability is divided into two subsections: granting the user the ability to see into the past/retrocognition, present/clairvoyance, or future/precognition depending on their affinity; with its other focus of this ability is mental manipulation - projecting/creating illusions, telepathy, memory/perception manipulation, and even hypnosis. You can choose one subsection’s aspect of this ability or can pay an undiscounted 100CP to have access to one aspect of both subsections of this power. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost to have access to both subsections and all their aspects.
--4. Eternal Life: 
Wielders of this power are often put into a supportive role, though master’s of this 
power is a fearsome sight to behold. At its core, this Divine Power grants a 
passive healing factor for its user (healing small cuts in second and broken 
bones in minutes). Its active ability can be divided into two subsections: a healing 
aspect, greatly stimulating  your recovery/regeneration with life energy (which 
can be shared with others); enhancing targets though not to the same degree as 
“Divine Power-Indestructible”; and resurrect the recently fallen and long dead 
unless of course the target has been decapitated. The other subsection of this 
Divine Power does the exact opposite, siphoning life of living beings to add to 
their own; damage reflection; and even using life energy to form constructs like 
giant statues or petals for you to control. You can choose one subsection of this 
ability or can pay an undiscounted 100CP to have access to one aspect of both 
subsections of this power. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost to have 
access to both subsections and their aspects.
	--5. Asura:
	One of the more esoteric powers of the Gods. At its core, this Divine Power 
makes the user more appealing to wildlife; making it easier to handle and 
command animals for the user. Its active ability enables the user to summon a 
specific spirit-animal life format will for them to command. The animals 
summoned become an extension of the user’s senses and will follow their 
commands explicitly; but needing the user’s concentration to stay manifested. 
Luckily practitioners do not suffer any sensory overload or feedback from pain or 
death of their summons. Speaking of the animal summoned by the user can be 
any mundane creature (insects, mammals, fish, birds, etc...) with their size and 
numbers varying per user though diminishing returns applies to the summon; 
bigger animals costing more energy to summon, with smaller ones costing 
less. The majority of the users can be divided between four major aspects: 
swarm types, summoning ten animals for every one a normal user would conjure; 
amalgamation types, basically the summon is a chimeric organism mix-maxing 
traits to a base form such as a flying tiger with eagle wings or a bipedal shark 
with gorilla limbs; primeval, can have your summon be an ancient life form 
(opens up dinosaurs, mammoths, devonian terrors, and other ancient beasts); or 
power type, gaining one unique ability which can range from being a copy of the 
Divine Powers listed or a single power of something else entirely (though no 
reality warping powers or a copy of “Monochrome”). On purchase your summon 
gains one aspect ,or you can pay an undiscounted 100CP to have access 
to two aspects. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost to have access to all 
aspects. Fanwank responsibly! 
	--6. Underworld: 
	For those with a more toxic personality.  At its core, this Divine Power grants a 
passive knowledge on how to concote/handle poisons and diseases while also 
gaining a resistance to poison and disease for their users (if you have purchased 
the “Ancients” perk the resistance is turned to an immunity). Its active ability 
allows users to have control over auras of death and decay; which takes on the 
forms of varying degrees of poison manipulation. These forms of poisons appear 
as either toxins or venom by growing natural weaponry (claws, talons, fangs, 
stinger, spikes); creating constructs (animals, plants, fungi under your control); or 
just creating straight up poison (adjusting its solubility, viscosity and acidity) to 
deliver your deadly payloads. Those born with this Divine Power can often be 
confused with those possessing the Divine Power -  Asura, though the conjured 
forms of Divine Power - Underworld lacks the same autonomy that Asura users 
have over their summons. You can choose one subsection of this ability or can 
pay an undiscounted 100CP to have access to one aspect of each subsection of 
this power. With a total of 200CP undiscounted cost to have access to all subsections and their aspects.
	--7. Heaven and Earth: 
A straightforward power, but no less destructive if not more than the other 
abilities known to the Gods. At its core, this Divine Power gives the user an 
immense resistance to a specific element, enough to make others believe they 
are immune to it.  Its active ability allows the user to either generate or 
manipulate a natural element of their choice (sadly time-space or other esoteric 
elements are not viable for this option). For an undiscounted 100CP, you are able 
to take on traits of the element you conjure; like being being able to manipulate 
lightning to increases one's speed or even to change into lightning. For an 
undiscounted 200CP, your power extends to tangent elements for you 
to control now too; best example is with water for ice and steam (though blood 
would be a stretch, fanwank reasonably). 
	--8. Primordial Strength: 
Instead of gaining a Divine Power, you become host to an ancient being that 
gives you access to their ability. At its core, their Divine Power has anti-healing 
properties for any wounds inflicted by the user; making those injuries only able to 
heal at the rate of a normal human being even if they have a healing factor. The 
active ability is determined by the particular being you are sheltering, as the host 
you may choose which one inhabits your body. Choosing the Phoenix (the 
crimson bird) makes you sprout fiery wings for flight and able to detach your 
feathers for explosions of fire, which regrow quickly. Choosing the Seiryu (the 
blue dragon) sees you generate scales for enhanced swimming speed, the ability 
to breathe underwater, and being able to detach your scales to create blasts of 
water. Choosing the Genbu (the black turtle) has you develop a shell upon you 
while doubling your strength and durability, and you are able to burrow/tunnel 
into the earth or earthen material at great speeds (with the latter option at a 
slower pace). Choosing the Qilin (the white kirin) has you growing platinum 
blonde fur across your body while enhancing your mobility for great bursts of 
speed, generating static electricity to discharge the more you move due to 
friction. All “enhanced movement” options start at half the speed of sound. For 
another undiscounted 100CP, you are able to host another ancient being. With a 
total of 200CP undiscounted cost you host all the ancient beings, though for now 
you can only have one active ability at a time."

But you can be kind. You’re in it for fun too, after all, so why not take a little handicap to make things interesting? You’ve got an easy time weakening yourself, to the point that you’re always able to find a way to limit or suppress your powers and abilities to some degree if desired. It might be a special ability that lets you do it or easily finding devices to help out, but it’ll ensure you can still get a good scrap going. It’ll even retain some of the fun, if you’re the sort to not enjoy it when limited, letting you gain satisfaction from winning under these challenging restrictions."

Shinigami would have decent skill in each of the four primary arts of Zanjutsu, Hoho, Hakuda and
Kido. A Shinigami would be a weaker Vice Captain, perhaps new to the role. A Hollow would be at least
Adjuchas class, possibly one of the older and weaker kinds of Arrancar that pulled off their own
masks, such as the Privaron. A Quincy could be a lower ranked officer in the Quincy King’s army or

For 300 CP, your levels of cursed energy are on par with Yuta Okkotsu, someone whose reserves exceed even that of Gojo’s by a significant margin.

While doing so it will be impossible for anyone to identify it and you may project an aura mimicking another. Second, as a result of the first effect any attacks that target factors like this will become ineffective.

 Ki is a preternatural and esoteric form of energy, and within living beings, Ki can be wielded and
harnessed via martial arts and other forms of physical activity, as well as specific exercises. Ki can
also be quantified as the strength and build of one's body, along with health, finesse, and muscle.
 Upon purchasing this perk, your Ki will be unlocked and you will be granted training in its use.
Using Ki allows you to improve the intensity of melee attacks, and project Ki blasts from your body.

over it. You may infuse it into your melee attacks and Ki Blasts if ""Ki Manipulation"" was purchased.

You always count as being just a part of the natural world around you for any purposes that might benefit you.

42,200,Power of Ego: Selfish Reality,Avesta of Black and White,Source ,"The Power of Ego, or the Power of the Self, is a special ability found among many strong Daeva. A sharp contrast to the Miracles of the Ashavan, which are based on the Power of the Many, this is an ability that sources its power in the strong will of an individual. It allows the user to accomplish a multitude of effects that defy the laws of physics, and even causality, simply by willing it. Things such as scooping half of a building using a spoon from across the street, twisting space, so an attack becomes unavoidable or forcibly negating the regeneration of an enemy.

Since this is an often-found power among the Daeva, those of the side of evil taking this perk instead find themselves with an immense talent for using the Power of Ego, if they couldn’t already use it, as well as a strong will to back it up. Those of the side of good instead gain this ability, something that is usually only possible for them via Commandments or artifacts."
43,200,Commandment: Vow(Lesser),Avesta of Black and White,Source ,"The basis of most supernatural abilities in the First Heaven, the Commandment appears as a self-imposed limitation taken before the Avesta. It is a declaration against the world that reflects the warrior’s personality and ideology. By swearing to God to live in a certain way, you receive a boon in exchange.

The nature of this boon varies greatly, since in the end it is up to the Truth to determine such a thing. Normally, a very restrictive bond would result in a greater power. Things such as vowing to always achieve victory, refusing any kind of companionship and living in solitude, or always fighting any being that establishes mutual recognition with one’s full strength. But there are other factors that may influence this result, such as the person’s own disposition and ideals. For example, a gentle being who took a vow of solitude would see a greater boon than those who are loners by nature. But also, those with great wills will see their Commandments also bear great results if it matches their nature, such as someone with a massive thirst for battle limiting themselves to not take any action that isn’t related to killing after establishing mutual recognition when another. And lastly, there is the own opinion of the Truth herself, who may grant better boons if she simply sees fit to do so, whether as part of her own plans or simply due to her own amusement or personal opinions of the person in fact.

The vow you take is very important, because breaking it will incur a divine punishment. When this break is unintentional, this may result in your death via divine punishment, enforced by the Law of the Truth. But when this breakthrough of your Commandment results from a willing act, an event known as Forced Falling Down occurs, in which the breaker is forced to switch sides, resulting in a change of personality and power, almost always for the worse.

While this indeed a dire thing, it is not as if most Commandments don’t have loopholes around their limitations. For example, Quinn’s Commandment makes her follow the orders of others to be able to act, and she cannot stop following other people’s orders. But the orders she receives are ranked in importance, so she can disregard someone’s orders as long as it is to fulfill a higher duty. Samrukh was also able to replace her lost limbs with prosthetics without violating her ‘do not heal yourself’ commandment.

There is also the possibility for those who have outgrown the Law of this universe itself to rebel against the punishment and outright ignore it, or even use brute force to warp reality in a way that allows for breakthrough of one’s commandment without incurring in divine punishment, such as the usage of the Power of Ego to maintain multiple contradictory commandments as some Daeva do. Albeit, this last effect is something that even the most powerful Daeva struggle with, resulting at best in just pushing the line of what’s acceptable before a willing breakthrough rather than outright denying the punishment. Only those who are stronger than God or have the capability to replace her can actively ignore the punishment. Albeit, doing so means rebelling against the Truth and may incur in her wrath, being stricken via other means than a forceful Fall when that it is not possible.

It is possible to take Commandments of limited duration, or which are active just until a condition is fulfilled. But this topic is purely academic stuff for almost everyone in the cosmos, usually no one would do this, nor could, for that matter. Commandments are strong beliefs and iron-clad held convictions, pridefully sworn as a particular way to face the world. It is impossible to replace them on a whim, as one would their clothing, unless one’s mentality and personality was hollow enough that they may not even be called human to begin with.

Since everyone is required to take a commandment as part of reading deep enough into the Avesta, you too have gained yours. The exact wording of the Commandment is up to you, as well as its restrictions. Here you have two options: You may take whatever you have gained via this jump, with the exceptions of the ‘Star Spirit’ and ‘Will of the King’ purchases, and have it be a result of your boon, at no cost at all. It is not such a strange occurrence, even if it is the result of a single Commandment. Individuals Nahid or Vararam have proven that a single Commandment can result in a large amount of powers and boons. But if you like to, you may have actually taken multiple Commandments in the way that some powerful Daeva, or the heretic Yazata Magsarion, have done.

The other option is to pay 200 CP and receive a Commandment similar to that gained by Quinn, Spenta Mainyu or Zaurid’s original Commandment. Basically, you get a boost in power by following a certain limitation but gain no real special powers from that. 

Again, you may decide to purchase multiple Commandments here.

Other abilities and items may interact with Commandments, further increasing their power if the compatibility is right. This is especially true with abilities related to your own will, like the Power of Ego that the Daeva wield.

Once this jump ends, you may decide to stop being bound by your Commandment(s) in exchange for losing any potential boon that they may grant at will, no longer bound by the Avesta. You may decide to activate them again at the start of the next jump. This only applies to any abilities not derived from the perks that you purchase below. Breaking your Commandment won’t deprive you of your abilities, but will incur in divine punishment during your time here.

44,200,One Source,Trinity Wonder ,Source,"Ki, magic. Ultimately, they are just energy. They come from the same source, and can be used to supplement each other. You can use one source to recharge or fuel the other. This won’t necessarily be an even 1:1 conversion. Some energies may need a disproportionate amount of less potent energy to be substituted in to create an equal ‘volume’ due to the difference of energy contained within. Similarly, the techniques of different systems and techniques from other worlds may tax your reserves differently. The techniques of Wuxia world are often much more energy intensive than that of their fantasy world analogs, such that what one mage might consider overflowing amounts of magic, the murim warrior would simply consider adequate enough to recharge."

This is your chance to design your own custom supernatural system, though know that you will be entering into a world severely lacking in ambient energy.

46,200,Captain,Bleach,Source,"Powerhouses of the spiritual worlds, this is the divide that separates the weak from the strong. Those at this level are the Captains, Espada and Stern Ritter of their kind, albeit the weaker and less

centuries old warrior, with a well rounded understanding of both combat and your races’ unique
abilities. Highly capable in most areas, from combat to technique to racial magic. A Bankai, if not
fully mastered, or Resurreccion is expected at this point. Your spiritual power has reached what
most would consider the level of an ‘average’ Shinigami Captain and you’re likely to be a frontline
fighter for any faction you join.

Some examples are thus. A Shinigami might be equal to Captain Komamura or Captain Hitsugaya
early in the story, powerful but hardly the cream of the crop as they are now. A Hollow would be
one of the lower Espada, an Adjuchas made Arrancar through the Hogyoko, such as Grimmjow or
Nnoitra. Of the Quincy, the lesser Stern Ritter such as Candice Catnipp or Bazz B are a good example. Of the Fullbringers, Ginjo before he takes Ichigo Kurosaki’s powers is a capable representative and
Artificial Spirits could look to powerful Bount like Jin Kariya or enhanced souls like Nemu."
47,200,Grudge Match,Jujutsu Kaisen,Source,"Death is a frequent occurrence for jujutsu sorcerers. Cursed spirits aren’t exactly inclined towards mercy or holding back, so every fight tends to be kill or be killed. Yet oftentimes, when one sees their companions brutally slain before their eyes, they don’t become demoralised – no, they become stronger. Cursed energy is fuelled by negative emotions, after all, so intense feelings of grief or rage will bolster it to beyond one’s normal limits.

For you, it’s not just your cursed energy that benefits from your negative emotions – it’s all of your powers. Any supernatural ability you wield will become stronger whenever anger, hatred, and the like fill you, with the boost you gain being greater the more intense these feelings are. Your control over your abilities becomes refined, and your blows pack that much more of a punch. This won’t be an enormous boost – it won’t allow you to defeat a foe that truly outclasses you – but it might just let you wound them before going down, or give you the edge you need over an otherwise equal opponent. Beware these emotions do not cloud your judgment, however."

be used by vessels which have sufficiently changed into an Ōtsutsuki, regardless of

You can take in the souls of those you slay or spirits you find wandering around, so long as you have more power than that spirit or the spirit is willing, and make it a part of a sort of hive within you. Each soul grants you more magical power to use so long as they stay within you, and you are able to release the spirits and direct them as attacks. The greater the negative emotions of the spirits within you, the bigger the boosts they’ll all give. A few hundred thousand nasty souls and you could throw out attacks that blow up cities with careless ease or swamp entire towns in corrupted ghost muck. The spirits you eat may remain within you between jumps but will be sent back to their original worlds if they are no longer residing within you."
70,400,Bearer of Legend,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Source,"Somehow, one of your weapons or even your body itself has been infused with an ancient and potent power. While I’ll leave the nature of such power up to you, the power can be used to “charge” up whatever is imbued with the power, and the longer you charge, the more power it expels when used, and there is no limit to how much you can charge."
71,400,Soul Power,Street Fighter,Source," Many throughout the world of Street Fighter hone and draw upon the power of
the body, Ki, whether they know it or not. There is another energy inherent in all living things
however, one rare and enigmatic enough to be unheard of, Soul Power.
 Upon purchase, you will gain intermediate skill and training with manipulating this energy
inherent to the soul. This allows you to reflect minor energy attacks, or project your own. You may
also transmit the energy through clothing or other inanimate objects for offensive or defensive
applications such as hardening a block or swatting an enemy with a strengthened scarf.
 While still a long ways away, time and training will eventually allow you to seal enemies or
corrupt/evil energy within different items like tarot cards, read someone's future and produce
illusions such as copies of yourself. You may also manifest your Elemental Affinity through Soul
Power, like with Ki."
72,400,Appetite Energy,Toriko,Source,"A potent form of energy generated within Gourmet Cells. By focusing its overwhelming hunger and desire to devour prey, a predator can emit this energy outside of its body and shape it for various purposes. 
Appetite Energy is highly versatile, having offensive, defensive, and useful supplementary applications. It can be emitted directly from the body to manifest semi-solid weapons and instruments. These manifestations possess, for the duration of their existence, properties comparable to the substances they emulate. When taking the form of Fork or Knife, for instance, Toriko's Appetite Energy can actually be 'melted' by temperatures which exceed the melting point of the iron cutlery being emulated. The energy can even manifest with the forms and behaviors of living creatures, as in Jiro's Rising Wolf Guinness Punch technique. 
Appetite Energy can also be infused directly into particular body parts, increasing their strength and even generating beneficial mutations. Sunny, for example, can infuse his hair directly with Appetite Energy to temporarily morph his feelers into Devil Feelers for his Satan Hair ability.
Be warned, like in Sunny case, body parts enhanced that way, may develop their own appetite and consume the user.
Jumpers unlike others will have an easier time controlling enhanced parts and have reduced mental resources needed to maintain it.

73,400,Pope’s Mind,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Source," Either as his student or once as a prolonged replacement, you have the qualities required to be the Pope of Sanctuary. Managing allies and threats on micro and macro scales, or recognizing one’s potential and ideal role, are all qualities of yours. Such trust and proximity to the Pope also comes with benefits, such as access to otherwise forbidden places, forgotten lore or secret technique like the dreaded “Demon Emperor Fist”. You gain a similar role and sum of knowledge in future jumps.

mightiest of Silver Saints within Athena's army. Indeed, a group of five Silver
Saints would find themselves utterly incapable of scratching you, such is the
extent of your prowess and resilience. Yet, your leadership qualities further
distinguish you from your peers, as you possess the keen ability to command
your soldiers efficiently and effectively."

The rage and the hatred you are experiencing grant you power, be it physical pain or emotional. The greater the pain you feel, the more power you will gain. Your body will heal faster, grow stronger, and even psychic powers grow within you as the growth you receive stays with you even once you have dealt with the source of your anger."
77,400,The Power of Darkness,Saint Seiya Episode G,Source,"You’re able to put the limitless rage and hatred within you and your allies to a much better use now. You’ve learned to use the power of Darkness at your will, draining away the negative emotions within yourself and others and using it to empower yourself to greater heights. Using this negative energy, you can significantly enhance any of your attacks or abilities, also infusing them with the traits of that dark energy. Infused attacks are much better at piercing through defenses and leave wounds that are very difficult and slow to heal. Against those who side with good, the darkness becomes even more effective than normal."
78,400,Smelting Aura,Feng Shen Ji,Source,"A unique power limited to those with the “mind’s eye”, rare human being’s who can perceive the “invisible air” or Qi as master’s call it. This Qi becomes the building blocks for a practitioner's construct to take shape: such as weapons, organs, objects, living creatures, etc... Though the more complex the construct is, the more aura/construction time it will require from the user. Most Smelting Aura users concentrate on a single type of constructed concept, as higher proficiencies will see their construct be as real as any other object; remaining as an independent object as long as the Smelting Aura remains unbroken. All broken or destroyed constructs return to the practitioner and can be used again immediately, the only cost for these constructs being the user’s concentration and the required Smelting Aura for the construct in question. Masters of this discipline can add elements from Wu Xing to be reflected in their constructs for additional/supernatural powers. Please reference the NOTES SECTION for more clarification. You start off with moderate proficiency in this art, being able to permanently conjure a single designated construct or around a dozen of the same construct with temporary forms; being able to expand your own reserves by either continually practicing. You are also able to teach this ability to others.
        As a being composed of 
Smelting Aura you are able to perform minor Body Manipulation on your body; 
healing or reshaping your form from your aura reserves, and even using parts of 
your body as material for your constructs. As a denizen of Phantom Island you 
have also achieved the next stage of utilizing Smelting Aura only possible for 
your kind - Battle Armor. At this stage the practitioner becomes composed or 
encased in the same material as their construct. Similar to the “Dark Arts - Limit 
Break”, construct is no longer constrained to their conjured form and is able to 
have its composition manipulated at will. For example one could make silk 
bandages as dense as steel able to cut/pierce like any other bladed weapon;  or 
stone boulders to become as light as a Feather while being as malleable as wet 
clay. Also the constructs formed from Battle Armor still follow the same rules as 
other Smelting Aura constructs and can be reformed the instant they are broken. 
Just take care to choose between reforming your own form or a construct with 
your aura reserves.
--If you bought the “Crystal Mind” perk, you now have the potential for limitless parallel thoughts separate from your own normal train of thoughts. These parallel thoughts can be used to maintain your constructs indefinitely or to focus on any other problems/powers/tasks you wish. You start with 4 parallel thoughts. You are able to train for more trains of thought on your own, but the more trains of thought you acquire the more difficult it becomes to acquire a new one; diminishing returns starting to take place past double digits.
You have the possibility to purchase the Crystal Mind perk for 200 cp if you roll this perk."
79,400,Dark Arts,Feng Shen Ji,Source,"A unique power relying on “igniting the user’s soul” (which is ultimately a mortal’s life force), emitting a greenish glow of ethereal flame showcasing one’s Soul Power. At its basic level, a practitioner can increase their own speed, strength, resistances, and even healing factors by 1.5 times; increasing in time and training. Soul Power really shines when you are able to Spiritize, injecting your own soul into a single object (usually a weapon) of the user’s choice to alter and enhance its power to make a Soul Gear. Once a person can Spiritze they can also access and learn the other techniques available to those with Soul Power. Beyond Spiritze, there is another level called Limit Break; when a user ignites their Soul Power beyond Spiritize to become one with their Soul Gear, shattering the physical limitations of the Soul Gear.  You are able to teach this ability to anyone who has a soul and you yourself starts with proficient knowledge in this art to Spiritize a Soul Gear though not enough to achieve a Limit Break yet.
 You 
also gain the ability to detect other powers/energy types (divine power, smelting 
aura, psionics, etc…) as a sixth sense - their location, their strength, any 
maladies that seem to be affecting their physical or spiritual states.


--If you also bought “Crystal Body”, you gain a regeneration ability for both 
your body and any items you wield (which would mend themselves). Any 
broken  bones, large lacerations, or any other injuries of a similar potency 
will fix themselves within minutes; with any chips or or broken fragments 
of an item matching that regeneration. Lost limbs or organs can regrow in a 
few weeks, with you being able to functionally normally while on the mend 
while constantly using your Soul Force as a supplement. Decapitation, 
great brain trauma, or complete obliteration being the only ways to keep 
you down as long as you have the will to persist.

It is unknown if Transcendent Vigor regenerates as the Gods seem hesitant to use more than what is necessary, which will never be a worry for you. Your Transcendent Vigor will always be fully replaced when not in use, needing but a single minute to recover in full. Post-Jump  this effect will carry on to all power pools you have access to.
—If you have “Crystal Soul”, once per Jump or once every ten years

level adventurer from an 1 star transcendent is something simple, yet extremely
complex and difficult to accomplish, that is the ability to freely manipulate your runes
into something greater, being able to use and mix all of them at the same time to
achieve much better results, and now you acquired this incredibly ability of fusing
runes and skills to a certain degree, at the beginning you will only be able to mix
runes and skills, but as you grow in power and acquire more control and mastery
over your powers you will be able like a transcendent fuse different powers into
something superior, should you attain a level similar of a 7 star transcendent of
power then you would be able to freely break the walls between your powers and
create a singular core that can be easily manipulated and strengthened for your own
purposes and through this by developing this core, develop all the different skills that
are mixed in it.

85,400,Devoid of Ego: Clothing of Convictions,Avesta of Black and White,Source ,"Normally, the thought of renouncing a Commandment, or taking a small Commandment, is not something that any individual would even consider. That is because the Vow taken in a Commandment is a declaration from the individual to the World, an expression of their deepest convictions and thoughts engraved on the Avesta. As such, renouncing a Commandment or taking them lightly would be as renouncing one’s core ideals or just taking these strong beliefs lightly.

It is a thought that normally only the hollow Man-Eating Demons would be able to practice. While you don’t require to be as devoid of regular emotions as they are, you are able to take their same approach to Commandments, and as such you are able to take Hollow Clothing Commandments. That is, you can take small-scale and temporary Commandments in exchange for lesser effects.

These include vows such as renouncing your sight for a few moments in order to gain a short- scale future sight or vowing not to move for the next three minutes in order to gain teleportation for a minute. These Commandments will never be able to reach the potency of a punishing Commandment that completely directs the life of a person, but they grant a great variety to someone’s arsenal for just small inconveniences. 

In future worlds, whenever you can gain a power based on your convictions and ideals, you will also be able to take temporary and lesser powers by ‘dressing’ yourself under limited and hollow ideals."
86,400,Commandment: Vow(Greater),Avesta of Black and White,Source ,"The basis of most supernatural abilities in the First Heaven, the Commandment appears as a self-imposed limitation taken before the Avesta. It is a declaration against the world that reflects the warrior’s personality and ideology. By swearing to God to live in a certain way, you receive a boon in exchange.

The nature of this boon varies greatly, since in the end it is up to the Truth to determine such a thing. Normally, a very restrictive bond would result in a greater power. Things such as vowing to always achieve victory, refusing any kind of companionship and living in solitude, or always fighting any being that establishes mutual recognition with one’s full strength. But there are other factors that may influence this result, such as the person’s own disposition and ideals. For example, a gentle being who took a vow of solitude would see a greater boon than those who are loners by nature. But also, those with great wills will see their Commandments also bear great results if it matches their nature, such as someone with a massive thirst for battle limiting themselves to not take any action that isn’t related to killing after establishing mutual recognition when another. And lastly, there is the own opinion of the Truth herself, who may grant better boons if she simply sees fit to do so, whether as part of her own plans or simply due to her own amusement or personal opinions of the person in fact.

The vow you take is very important, because breaking it will incur a divine punishment. When this break is unintentional, this may result in your death via divine punishment, enforced by the Law of the Truth. But when this breakthrough of your Commandment results from a willing act, an event known as Forced Falling Down occurs, in which the breaker is forced to switch sides, resulting in a change of personality and power, almost always for the worse.

While this indeed a dire thing, it is not as if most Commandments don’t have loopholes around their limitations. For example, Quinn’s Commandment makes her follow the orders of others to be able to act, and she cannot stop following other people’s orders. But the orders she receives are ranked in importance, so she can disregard someone’s orders as long as it is to fulfill a higher duty. Samrukh was also able to replace her lost limbs with prosthetics without violating her ‘do not heal yourself’ commandment.

There is also the possibility for those who have outgrown the Law of this universe itself to rebel against the punishment and outright ignore it, or even use brute force to warp reality in a way that allows for breakthrough of one’s commandment without incurring in divine punishment, such as the usage of the Power of Ego to maintain multiple contradictory commandments as some Daeva do. Albeit, this last effect is something that even the most powerful Daeva struggle with, resulting at best in just pushing the line of what’s acceptable before a willing breakthrough rather than outright denying the punishment. Only those who are stronger than God or have the capability to replace her can actively ignore the punishment. Albeit, doing so means rebelling against the Truth and may incur in her wrath, being stricken via other means than a forceful Fall when that it is not possible.

It is possible to take Commandments of limited duration, or which are active just until a condition is fulfilled. But this topic is purely academic stuff for almost everyone in the cosmos, usually no one would do this, nor could, for that matter. Commandments are strong beliefs and iron-clad held convictions, pridefully sworn as a particular way to face the world. It is impossible to replace them on a whim, as one would their clothing, unless one’s mentality and personality was hollow enough that they may not even be called human to begin with.

Since everyone is required to take a commandment as part of reading deep enough into the Avesta, you too have gained yours. The exact wording of the Commandment is up to you, as well as its restrictions. Here you have two options: You may take whatever you have gained via this jump, with the exceptions of the ‘Star Spirit’ and ‘Will of the King’ purchases, and have it be a result of your boon, at no cost at all. It is not such a strange occurrence, even if it is the result of a single Commandment. Individuals Nahid or Vararam have proven that a single Commandment can result in a large amount of powers and boons. But if you like to, you may have actually taken multiple Commandments in the way that some powerful Daeva, or the heretic Yazata Magsarion, have done.

The other option is to pay 200 CP and receive a Commandment similar to that gained by Quinn, Spenta Mainyu or Zaurid’s original Commandment. Basically, you get a boost in power by following a certain limitation but gain no real special powers from that. For 400 CP instead, you may decide to instead create Commandments with more exotic results, like those of Munsarrat’s second Commandment, Mashyana or Ferdows, but you may not take anything that it’s already a perk in this jump, as those are the result of very special circumstances, nor an effect that it’s stronger than the 600 CP perks. You can see examples of Commandments in the Notes section.

Again, you may decide to purchase multiple Commandments here.

Other abilities and items may interact with Commandments, further increasing their power if the compatibility is right. This is especially true with abilities related to your own will, like the Power of Ego that the Daeva wield.

Once this jump ends, you may decide to stop being bound by your Commandment(s) in exchange for losing any potential boon that they may grant at will, no longer bound by the Avesta. You may decide to activate them again at the start of the next jump. This only applies to any abilities not derived from the perks that you purchase below. Breaking your Commandment won’t deprive you of your abilities, but will incur in divine punishment during your time here.

considered quite famous, as either a brilliant young prodigy or a true veteran of nearly a millennia of
action. Most core skills, to combat and racial techniques, are at the level of an expert user. In terms
of Reiryoku, you’d have about twice as much as the average Captain and you’d be considered to
have some level of mastery of your racial release state or unique power. Examples of this level are sparing but eye-catching. Byakuya Kuchiki of the Shinigami is an excellent
showcase of the sort of overall level of skill and superb power available. A mighty warrior, skillful
magician, intelligent leader and fine man. But clearly lesser than the true Shinigami veterans, such as
Shunsui Kyoraku or Unohana Retsu. Among Hollows, the higher level Espada such as Starrk or
Harribel are a clear example, likely making you a Vasto Lord yourself. To the Quincy, powerful Stern
Ritter like Bambietta Basterbine or Mask de Masculine are your best choices. Make no mistake, you’re not the strongest with this or even on par with the second and third

89,400,Strange Energy,Jujutsu Kaisen,Source,"For most sorcerers, cursed energy on its own isn’t anything particularly special – it’s just the thing they use to enhance their physical abilities and fuel their cursed techniques. A very rare few, however, are born with energy that possesses unusual traits, unique to the individual. While not inherently more powerful, these properties are difficult for normal sorcerers to deal with, making it a potentially significant advantage in combat depending on how it is used.

Now, your energy, too, has something rather unusual about it, a trait that sets it apart from the norm. This can be almost anything: perhaps your energy has an edge to it, allowing it to cut even when using bludgeoning attacks and being significantly more painful to get hit by than normal. Or maybe it has the properties of electricity, allowing you to shock your opponents with your blows, or perhaps even creating arcs of lightning with enough practice and control. While this doesn’t make your cursed energy directly stronger, it’s worth noting that reinforcing one’s body with cursed energy, the usual means of protecting against cursed energy-based attacks, is far less effective against defending against these traits than it is normal energy. Furthermore, you also gain a high level of resistance to whatever your trait may be: the aforementioned cursed energy with electrical properties would allow its user to shrug off lightning bolts without much issue, for example."

96,500,Psycho Power,Street Fighter,Source,"Psycho Power, an energy as enigmatic as it is evil. It is said to be similar in

able to empower physical blows and manifest as purple and black energy blasts, this also allows you
to float, teleport and control the minds of the meek by brainwashing them over time with repeated
exposure to your corrupt energy.
 You may also temporarily, compared to the permanent form displayed by Bison, expel altruistic
emotion such as remorse, compassion or humanity from your soul to commit unspeakable evil
before returning to normal. As previously mentioned, Psycho Power grows more powerful just by
immersing yourself in an environment of negativity, allowing you to attain considerable strength in
little time.
 While theoretically possible with other forms of energy in this world, Psycho Power has shown the

When first manifesting, Appetite Demons appear to be nothing more than an aura of energy

creation without the need of worry, desire, and doubt.
 While not granting mastery, purchasing this perk does allow you to attain the Power of
Nothingness. Just like Satsui no Hado it can make one incredibly powerful, and makes the user
resistant to harm from many physical and spiritual attacks as well as a better fighter.
 In stark contrast to its opposition, the Power of Nothingness also has the ability to weaken,
destroy and seal evil powers away. Unlike Satsui no Hado, it is not the power to defeat one's
enemies, but to grow in skill.
 The practitioner must be careful while wielding the Power of Nothingness, for it can only be
mastered by one pure of mind, compassion, mercy and inner peace. As such, while both ""Power of
Nothingness"" and ""Satsui no Hadou"" can be purchased, and potentially acquired through training injump, they can't be active at the same time due to direct conflict between them.
 You'll need to make an active, prolonged effort to switch from one to the other due to how
different the mindsets required are. Purchasing one or the other allows you to more easily do this
however."
102,600,Satsui no Hadou,Street Fighter,Source,"The complete opposite of the Power of Nothingness, Satsui no Hado is a
form of Ki that is rooted in the darker aspects of the natural human instinct (including the desire to
survive, trample, and impose over opposition), and on a metaphysical level, the natural occurrence
and manifestation of loss, decline, and destruction.
 To tap into the Satsui no Hado, a person must be so consumed with the desire for winning and
perfection, be close to being killed, or else possess such intense rage and hatred, that they are
willing to kill. While not granting full control or mastery, purchasing this perk does allow you to draw
upon the power of Satsui no Hado.
 Just like the Power of Nothingness, Satsui no Hado makes its users incredibly powerful, resistant
to many forms of physical and spiritual damage and transforms them into a better fighter. In stark
contrast to the Power of Nothingness, the users of Satsui no Hado also gain the ability to sense, and
potentially influence, the emergence of the Satsui no Hado in others.
 Only people who push themselves to be the best at any cost can take full advantage of it,
however, the untrained mind can be driven into insanity if they are not mentally ready for it. To
become fully immersed in Satsui no Hado and master it is to lose one's humanity and compassion.
 As such, while both ""Power of Nothingness"" and ""Satsui no Hadou"" can be purchased, and
potentially acquired through training in-jump, they can't be active at the same time due to direct
conflict between them."

willpower, letting one temporarily push past their normal limits to match a superior foe close to

awaken this through extensive meditation and training, though it can take years to obtain.
Others develop it spontaneously by disabling or even destroying their own five senses, or even
brute force the threshold with emotion - though these are more exceptions than the rule, and
very unlikely for you to develop in a short time. But once you have become aware of the
Seventh Sense, your sensitivity and harnessing of Cosmo increases drastically, allowing you to

119,600,The Final Getsuga,Bleach,Source,"The true power of a Zanpakuto comes not from immense Reiryoku or total mastery of technique. It
comes from the heart. The understanding you develop with this piece of yourself, the bonds you
forge and the loyalty between two comrades. There is where true power can be found. Forming such
bonds with spirits or intelligent sources of power within your being allows you to increasingly
improve the power of your bond. The closer you grow with your Zanpakuto, the more powerful their
abilities will grow, the easier they are to use and the less costly their release is to maintain. Truly
deep bonds can even reveal entirely new powers. The two of you coming together as one to discover
new sides of yourselves and in doing so, uncovering similarly new abilities. Obtaining a deep level of intimacy, an intense bond and acceptance of each other, would make you far superior to an otherwise equal opponent that lacked this camaraderie with their blade. Once a true and full bond is created, you will have the opportunity to truly become one. Known as a
Final Technique, undergoing this process will destroy the gap between the two of you and create a
new being. Your dear ally does not die from this even if you can no longer perceive them as separate,
instead rejoining you to become an integral part of who you are. The final release gained from this, for a Zanpakuto’s Final Technique, would be similar to a greatly enhanced version of their Bankai state. Unlike the few Zanpakuto who can perform similar techniques as a desperation measure, the
complete affinity you and your sword forged will allow you to retain this state and your spiritual
powers. The state itself is not permanent, acting similar to your previous releases, but it can be
entered with a moments notice. It may even leave some changes on your body outside of it, a sign of
the part of you that has rejoined the whole. This above process is not limited to pieces of your own soul. Any being that has a connection with
you and exists within your being is open to it. It requires a genuine and sincere bond from each side, failing if either side knowingly falsifies it in some way. But even a Hollow or a Demon could become one with their host. The changes you experience from this combination are likely to be much more
significant if used with a being that was not originally part of your own soul, as a fair warning. "
120,600,Exposure Therapy,Bleach,Source,"A normal human, fated to never give a meaningful contribution to this battle between life and death, right? It’d sure suck to be friends with the guy who saves the world, if he forgets about you in the
process. But if you can stick around long enough, this might help you stay relevant. Exposure to
power will very slowly cause related powers to develop in you too. The constant presence of a
uncontrolled source of spiritual power will quickly awaken your own spiritual awareness and very
slowly unlock spirit powers of your own. This might mean gaining enhanced physical abilities and the
power to create fire or even lucking into a more unique ability, if you had secret potential of your
own. Achingly slow compared to naturally gained powers, you can still slowly develop in power and ability
from exposure, then start training what you’ve gained intentionally. This isn’t limited to just
supernatural power sources but long term exposure to intense sources of mundane power can be
quite hazardous. You might develop something useful from sitting around a nuclear power plant all
day but are the health problems really worth it?"
121,600,Vessel,Jujutsu Kaisen,Source,"Many centuries ago, some of the most powerful sorcerers in the world decided to cheat death. They became cursed objects, nigh-indestructible remnants of their former bodies imbued with their cursed energy, designed to last throughout the ages. Then, no matter how much time passes, if someone decides to ingest the cursed object, the cursed energy within will overwhelm the consumer, the host’s body being completely being taken over, and the sorcerer of old incarnating anew. Except, sometimes a host has a strong enough will to suppress their would-be possessor, gaining great power in the process.

Now, like Yuji Itadori or Hana Kurusu, you are another such case, having consumed a cursed object and, against the odds, subjugated the cursed energy within. Strangely enough, though, the sorcerer the cursed object belonged to doesn’t seem too bothered by this turn of events. Unlike others, they have now have no desire to take control of your body for themselves, and are content to live in symbiosis with you.

The personality, history, and other such details of this incarnated sorcerer are free for you to determine as you see fit. They’re little more than a passenger within your body, and as such are unable to use any of the abilities they had in life. At most, they can use their power to harmlessly manifest a mouth on your body, which they can use to verbally communicate with you and others. They can also draw your mind into their innate domain, an ‘inner world’ of their mind and soul of sorts, to talk with you face-to-face, though naturally this won’t be done without your consent.

There are a number of benefits to having an ancient sorcerer sharing your body. The first is that their levels of cursed energy have now been added to yours – which, given that their amount of cursed energy exceeds the vast majority of modern sorcerers, is nothing to sneeze at. The second is that their presence offers a measure of protection to your mind and soul. Anyone trying to control, manipulate, or otherwise affect them against your will will face far greater resistance than usual as your symbiotic partner does their best to defend you, making it so even an exceptionally powerful special grade curse would struggle to do much of anything to you.

Eventually, it may even be possible for you to learn how to use the innate cursed technique of the incarnated sorcerer within you. Such a thing will not be easy achieved, however, and will require not just a very strong rapport, but a great amount of training and experimentation before it even begins to be possible, and being able to use it proficiently will be further off still. You may purchase a technique from the Cursed Technique section at a discount, to represent their cursed technique. Otherwise, it will either be impossible for you to use their cursed technique, or they never possessed one to begin with."

123,600,Lone Ranger ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Source,"Kokichi Muta, better known as Mechamaru, was born with a Heavenly Restriction: a condition where a sorcerer is born with a significant disadvantage compared to their peers, in exchange for great boons elsewhere. While some individuals’ Heavenly Restrictions grant them great physical abilities in exchange for abnormally low levels of cursed energy, his was quite the opposite. Instead of a powerful body, he was born with several missing limbs, and lived in constant pain. In exchange, he gained something no other sorcerer could possess: the ability to use his cursed technique over incredible ranges.

Somehow, though, you have achieved the same feat without having to sacrifice your physical condition in return. While they may not be any more powerful than before, the range of all of your techniques and supernatural abilities have been vastly increased. A technique that could only be used out to a maximum of a few hundred metres before, for instance, would now have a range that would allow you to use it anywhere in Japan with no loss in efficiency. Muta used this to great effect with his Puppet Manipulation technique, allowing him to puppeteer his cursed corpses as if he were right next to them while he remained in a bunker on the other side of the country.

Of course, there is something of a restriction to this, that being the limits of your own perception. While your range may extend for hundreds of miles in theory, if you can’t see something that far away it’s not exactly going to be easy to use your techniques on them. With some creativity, or perhaps a technique that comes with the ability to perceive things at a distance beyond what your own eyes can see, though, this shouldn’t be too much of an issue."

There are many degrees and levels of mastery and power with the use of Cosmo, but for the purposes of your time here, you will be quite incredible amongst Cosmo Users. As a Saint, you will have the average level of power and skill akin to that of a Gold Saint, meaning that you have long since unlocked the Seventh Sense. You have the power to destroy massive stellar objects and to move far faster than the speed of light. As a Titan, you will instead access the holy power of Dunamis, a divine equivalent to Cosmo. Darker and denser than Cosmo, it can be difficult to take hold of but you have largely mastered your use of it. You are equal to most of your Titan brethren in the use and power of it, putting you at a level that allows you to destroy entire galaxies and outmatch the Gold Saints with ease—right up until they do the impossible.

While a Titan may have more power, a Saint has a natural tendency to do the impossible and perform miracles that allow them to reach far beyond the power they normally have access to. The battle between a Saint and Titan may at first look to be blatantly one-sided, but for a Gold Saint with the will to win, they can triumph even when they should be crushed without mercy."
137,800,Supreme Karmic Might,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Source,"Maybe through deeds in your past
lives, or some other strange occurrence, you have found yourself with extreme quantities of
prismatic Karmic Light surrounding you (up to around a thousand kilometers). This light serves
many effects. Besides enhancing your luck to grand heights, it makes you much more beautiful and
immediately likable to people on first glance, and unless they have some deep issues, they won’t
be harming you anytime soon. Furthermore, the aforementioned luck this brings is tremendous, if
not miraculous, to say the least, enough that almost any major power would want you on their side,
even if it requires coercion or force, all for the sake of benefitting from your luck alongside you.
However, personal power is still King, and if you continuously rely on this luck it might fail you at
a crucial moment and lead to your death. As an added function for your convenience, you may dim
the light you emit to nothing at all, if you do not feel like letting others bask in your glorious
radiance. This also prevents you decreasing your prismatic karmic light no matter how much sinful
acts you commit like killing trillions of non-cultivators everyday. You won’t gain a speck of aura
of sin or have the karmic sinflames descend on you."
138,800,Nine Chaos Seals,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Source,"Originally found and memorized by Daoist Three Purities, these
Nine Seals were seemingly created by the Primordial Chaos, and each seal that is mastered gives
one insights into a Dao tailored to the user. Now they are ingrained into your soul. When fully
mastered, they create an azure flower within the soul of their owner, enabling them to convert any
and all forms of energy into a mist which enhances the physical abilities of a cultivator to
tremendous heights, allowing an Elder God to utterly demolish newly ascended World level
experts, and fight on equal terms with ordinary World Level experts. There seems to be a limit to

just how much of the mist you can have stored within your soul, however. Even though you’ll be
able to fight a lot longer than a person who relies on their own energy, don’t think that you’ll be
able to fight like that forever. Another thing to keep in mind is that fully comprehending these
Seals in a short period of time was impossible even for Nuwa, who had mastered over eighty
thousand Daos. Unless you are a genius of a level unheard of in the Three Realms, it’s going to be
some time before you can use these seals and the secrets contained within to their full potential."
139,800,Will of the King: Big Bang,Avesta of Black and White,Source ,"A rare quality that could be called a Miracle in itself. You now possess an ‘ego’ that surpasses even the Avesta and could stand toe to toe with God herself. A desire to overthrow the God of the world (Truth) and impose a new Law into the cosmos, giving birth to a new universe. Not only is this a special disposition that is no longer tainted by the current Law, but also a special quality of your soul. That is, you have the qualifications for sitting on the Divine Throne, and spreading your Law by undergoing an apotheosis and becoming a God.

As you are now, this untapped potential seems to be of little use. But with time, as long as you attune to your deepest craving, you may potentially begin to challenge this world in multiple ways, such as ignoring or limiting the effects of contradicting a Commandment, even negating the entire Law of the Avesta and Commandments all-together in a certain area. Eventually, you may ascend into godhood and challenge the current order. That is, you will start to emanate, repainting the world with your own color. And if your strength proves to be as great or greater than that of the current God, you may also dig into the Singularity, challenging them for the right to dye the entirety of creation with your color.

However, this is not something that you can do immediately in most cases. Depending on your craving, the path to activate your Law and become a full-fledged God may require a costly undertaking, such as Sirius’ Paradise Lost requiring him to save ‘everyone’ personally before being able to fully emanate.

And just like the Covetous Dragon, you can also decide to prevent yourself from emanating by not following your desire, but once you realize it you won't be able to stop yourself. At least not just with this potential. And that might be a wise decision if you aren’t strong enough yet to challenge the sitting Godhead.

It may even be possible that your own actions, should they lead you to take a path that goes against your own Law, such as taking a Commandment that goes against your very own ideal existence, may make it impossible to fully emanate until you fully accept your own craving and discard the other limitations.

By default, this craving is manifested as a Hegemony type.

However, you may also decide to be self-centered beyond reason, and instead of seeking to change the world, seek to reach your own ideal self. Thus, you may decide to take the path of Transcendence and instead become a Transcendence God. You won’t be able to emanate, but you will also be able to use the power of the Big Bang, or as it will be known in other eras, Taikyoku or Atziluth. Be advised that Transcendence Gods may only manifest in multiverses, as they are a living universe, they cannot exist in those universes, like that of Ahura Mazda, where only a single universe exists, for those who follow this path cannot replace the Godhead."
140,800,Custom Technique(800),Jujutsu Kaisen,Source,"If none of the above options appeal to you, you can always make your own technique. Use the existing techniques listed above as guidelines for determining its price and the power of its effects. A situational cursed technique or one with a lot of limitations would likely only be 200 CP, for example, while one with overwhelming power and versatility would be 800 CP.

141,900,9th Sense Spark,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Source,"My my… and they said Ashmita was the man the closest to the Gods. Your soul and cosmo, through luck or contemplation, resonated with the Ichor and made it your own, a glimpse of what lies beyond : the 9th sense, Godhood, the ""supreme virtue"". You gain a soft “immortality” by agelessness, and can choose one theme or domain, like “fire” or “stars” or even “dreams”. Within this domain , using your cosmo will not only magnify your power tremendously, but whereas the 7th sense bruteforce results, the 9th allows you to outright ignore normal limitations of physics and reality, putting that saved energy to better use and casually bringing forth litteral impossibles to life.
Right now, with a Gold or God cloth, your domain’s power could equal minor Gods like Morpheus, or even intermediate ones like Hypnos and Thanatos with great efforts, although in every other aspect you are still as “weak” as a mortal, and giants like the 12 Olympians are still way above you with just this. It will take time, far more than this jump has to offer, to completely open yourself to the true 9th, offering wonders like planetary reach, true immortality, or physics breaking outside of your Domain. But time is something you have plenty of…"
142,1000,9th Sense/Omega,Saint Seiya Omega,Source,"With the attainment of the elusive 9th sense, known as Godhood, or reach
Omega alone which was once considered impossible. Regardless you ascend to
the pinnacle of existence. This transcendent state grants you a form of soft
immortality, rendering you ageless and beyond the grasp of time's inexorable
march.
But beyond mere longevity, the 9th sense bestows upon you a profound
connection to a chosen theme or domain, whether it be the fiery infernos of
creation, the twinkling mysteries of the stars, or the ethereal realm of dreams.
Within this domain, your Cosmo becomes a vessel of boundless power,
magnifying your abilities to unimaginable heights.
The 9th sense also allows you to transcend the limitations of physics and reality
itself. With effortless ease, you can bend the fabric of existence to your will,
bringing forth literal impossibilities into the realm of reality. At your current level
you are considered to be a minor god of your faction. Similar to that of Hypnos
and Thanatos in the past Hades army."
143,1000,God of Destruction,Dragon Ball,Source,"The Gods of Destruction also known as the Hakaishin are one of the two beings in
charge of maintaining balance in their universe. They work alongside the Angels and
the Supreme Kais to ensure that the balance of their universes is upheld. Taking this
perk makes it so that you were either born as a new God of Destruction or that you have
instead undergone the training to become one successfully. This will make you equal in
strength to the average God of Destruction. Being a God of Destruction grants a variety
of advantages such as a massive power level, ageless immortality, and most importantly
the ability to use the Energy of Destruction.
The Energy of Destruction allows the Gods of Destruction to exert combat power far
beyond their limits. Additionally, this energy is corrosive and capable of destroying
anything completely. Even beings who are significantly stronger such as the Angels are
cautious of this energy. Lastly, unlike a standard God of Destruction your life will not be
linked to a Supreme Kai. Lastly, if you are not satisfied being an ordinary God of
Destruction then you can pay an additional 200 CP. This will grant you another strand of
Energy of Destruction. This will immediately put you at the peak of the Gods of
Destruction. Only the true veterans amongst them such as Bomen or Klein."
144,1000,The Grey,Dragon Ball,Source,"Normally a god must officially acquire a position such as the God of Destruction to jump
from Grade 2 to Grade 3. Otherwise it is impossible to bypass this, however there are a
select few mortals capable of bypassing this. The most infamous of them is a being
called Jiren the Grey. The demigod warrior shattered the limits of divinity surpassing the
Gods of Destruction through pure power. Somehow though the impossible happened
again when you arose matching the legendary hero. Your sheer power and presence is
overwhelming allowing you to fight a full level beyond your grade. You are a warrior who
can shatter armies with your mere presence and bring renowned experts down with
ease. Lastly, this also gives you access to Jiren’s ability known as “The Eye” which
supposedly was equal to Ultra Instinct in might."
