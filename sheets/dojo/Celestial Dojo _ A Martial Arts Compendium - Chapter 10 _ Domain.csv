1,100,Family properties,Cradle V1,Domain,"You gain a series of properties that your family uses to train the whelps. Some are hunting grounds, some are foundries for sacred items, and some are places to contemplate your path. You gain 8 of them, split between any purposes your family used them for. You can travel to them instantly via the warehouse."
2,100,Spirit Farm,A Will Eternal,Domain,"What every good sect needs is an area that they can grow and raise the more domestic
variety of spiritual fauna and flora. Adventuring to gain rare resources is all well and good,
but they also need a stable income of cultivation material. This is your one. A moderately
large area of farmland. There is space for farming crops, though do try to look after the soil
for the results. There is also grassland for animals, complete with a chicken pen filled with a
plethora of spirit tailed chickens which are delicious to eat, helps with your cultivation, and
whose feathers can be burned to produce two-colour flames. Renovate this grassland as
you wish to take care of different farm animals."
3,100,A Hidden Manse,Generic Exalted,Domain,"Now we're talking. You get a Manse, the Manse of course
being a piece of land that is somehow magical in some fashion or another. They're aspected
towards a certain type of Essence, either elemental essence such as Wood, Water, Earth, Fire,
or Air or alternatively they're aspected towards the Celestial elements such as the Sun, Moon,
Stars, or even Infernal or Abyssal (which are quite rare normally). Aside from being a spot of
land that you now own (as long as you can protect it) a Manse also produces a Hearthstone.
Hearthstones, when socketed into certain weapons/armor/amulets, provide both unique magical
effects and act as channels of the Manse itself allowing for vastly improved regeneration of
Essence. Did I mention you also regenerate Essence faster while in the Manse? Yeah, you do.
Anyways there are far too many Manses to actually list here in this document so we'll just go by
price. For 50cp you can get a 1dot manse. For 100cp a 2dot. For 150cp a 3dot. For 300cp you
can get a 4dot. For 600cp you can get the most powerful manses at 5dots. You can choose any
Manse you want from the Core books or official supplement books for Exalted that you have
paid the appropriate cost for.
Of note is that while you can have more than one Manse only ones you purchase here will
follow you between jumps, inserting themselves flawlessly into new worlds (or as an addition to
your Warehouse, your choice either or). Additionally you will need at least one open hearthstone
socket for every hearthstone you have if you want to make use of them. Manse's can range
from the size of a small forest clearing to the size of a reasonably large nobles estate (call it 100
acres), you choose what size yours is, the more expensive the Manse you bought the bigger it
can be."
4,200,Treasure Halls        ,Cradle V1,Domain,"You gain 3 treasure halls from an average school in this world. The lesser treasure hall will make the average cultivator salivate, and the middle and greater treasure halls will be far greater than those. Doesn’t update but will refill with anything you use or break at the start of a new jump."
5,200,Gourmet Realm,Toriko,Domain,"With that perk Gourmet Cells act as a gateway to their own part of Realm where one could wait for an appropriate moment to emerge from it once more. That Realm has some unknown connection to the Realm of Souls. Also it will easily indicate growth of one's own strength, by becoming more complex."
6,200,Clock Tower,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Domain,"A sizable clock tower with an aesthetic design of your
choosing, it will display nine flames - representing the life force of yourself and your
companions. The flames will shine brighter when one is in combat or a struggle of some kind, or
dim if they (or you) are in danger or on death’s door. Should you look into one of the flames, you
will see a hazy vision of where the person the flame represents is and what they’re doing. You
may attach this to any property you own or simply attach the clock by itself to your Warehouse."
7,200,Fancy Mansion,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Domain,"A luxurious, three-story mansion fit for a king! Or
someone with way too much disposable income. It has all the basic amenities one could ask for,
as well as a household full of servants to maintain it and cater to whatever you happen to need.
These servants don’t follow you between jumps, but each new batch will have the same
knowledges as the previous ones - though they don’t do much besides housekeeping and
managing the mansion."
8,200,Vital Blood Fountain,A Will Eternal,Domain,"A strange, almost organic looking fountain in the shape of a large cracked finger the size of a
normal man. From the fissures of this fountain endlessly flows Undying Blood, the blood of
cultivators of the Undying Live Forever codex, within which powerful vital energy can be felt.
Surrounding this finger is a meter deep and meter wide basin into which the blood falls.
Absorbing this blood helps with the replenishment and cultivation of vital energy, a key
component in body cultivation. Utilising this fountain is sure to speed up body cultivation
several fold."
9,200,The Underhaus,Abyssals Exalted,Domain,"Your very own Underworld. Or at least, a slice of Underworld for yourself. For 200 cp, this
adds an Underworld layer to your cosmic warehouse, taking on the appearance of a dark
reflection of your existing warehouse, seen through the lens of death. Located ""below"" your
warehouse in the same way that the greater Underworld is below the living world of
Creation, you may designate parts of your warehouse to be small, enduring shadowlands to
access this Underhaus more easily. Here you may respire necrotic essence, interact with
ghosts and immaterial spirits, and store things that cannot bear the light of the sun.
Alternatively, if that isn’t enough, you may pay a full 600 cp and get something much more
expansive. Instead of merely receiving a dark mirror of your warehouse, each of the various
attachments, properties, and lands that follow you will have underworld reflections of their
own. These properties shall sit as anchors within the world and each of your properties, in
whole or in part, may be made into shadowlands to lead down into this greater Underhaus.
Connecting all of these disjointed underworld landmarks will be an underworld appropriate to
the world they stand in, a dark world that gains solidity and detail from the memories of the
dead. Where none have lived or died, the terrain is grey and nearly featureless phantasms.
But where many people have lived their lives and breathed their last, this underworld is filled
with dark reflections and remnants of what has been lost. Primeval forests that have since
been cut down and burnt for farmland, the remnants of cities lost to war and villages lost to
plague, and whatever else has been lost to the sands of time in the world you find yourself
in. The population of this underworld, aside from any followers you bring with you, would be
composed merely of plasmic creatures and echoes of the dead, not true ghosts of the
natives. However, once established below a world, the dead of that place may choose to
resist the call of whatever fate would normally remain for them past death, to linger within the
Underhaus as ghosts."
10,300,Mountaintop School,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Domain,"Cultivators, like all other intelligent beings, tend to band
together in sects or schools. This property is a mountaintop compound capable of housing about
fifty thousand people, and can act as a school and area to set up a superpower like Snowdragon
Mountain. After this jump, the compound will follow you, either placing itself on a mountaintop of
your choosing or staying in a mountain-sized pocket dimension. You can remove it from this
pocket dimension and place it on a mountaintop whenever you wish."
11,300,Arcane Pocket Realm,A Will Eternal,Domain,"The mysterious arcane realm of the Spirit-Stream sect, empty of any people, a world of grey
in which thought can be given form. It clears the minds of any inside it, and makes
enlightenment many times faster while inside. The only downside to this pocket realm is that
it is quite energy intensive to keep open for prolonged periods of time. As such, the original
was only opened for a chosen few on special occasions, for a day at most. As the entrance
closes, those inside are instantaneously teleported out."
12,300,Wild Prison,A Will Eternal,Domain,"A giant prison to chain up powerful evil cultivators. When in chains, their cultivation is
suppressed to the mortal level, although their longevity will remain. Those trapped in this
prison are also unable to cultivate while trapped, meaning that they will only grow weaker as
their energy slowly drains away. The walls themselves are reinforced to the point of blocking
nascent soul cultivators, to prevent break-ins. There are enough cells to imprison a good few
thousand people."
13,400,Training Dimensions,UQ Holder,Domain,"The ordinary world won’t always contain what and who you need to properly train. Beings of sufficient power or just a place where you can let loose without worrying about innocents being harmed. This old gateway appears on a property that you own or standing alone near your starting location, activating at your command and creating a portal to an alternate dimension fitting to your training purposes. The gateway links to a dimension that provides a properly powerful foe for you, no matter how strong or strange you are, and often that foe will have specific abilities that encourage growth in you along certain lines. If you wish to train your regeneration, perhaps the gateway will lead you to a monster that attacks at great speed and leaves a large number of small wounds that build over time. Training your strength and you’ll find yourself pitted against a towering behemoth of stone and steel. Only one gateway can be held at a time and the dimensions you go to hold little beyond the creature and the environment around them."
14,400,Underground Hideout,UQ Holder,Domain,"This is a gargantuan cavern located under a property of yours, or just out near to your starting location, that holds a small hideout for you. The cavern is genuinely massive, measuring dozens of miles from one end to the other, and is pitch black most of the time. It’s also filled with a wide variety of monsters, from nasty mutated sea-lions lurking in the lakes down here to massive spiders roaming the dark. They don’t seem interested in attacking you though. The hideout here is well defended, physically and magically, but isn’t really containing anything but a few decades of provisions to survive on. However, the entire cavern has an extreme strong magical seal on it that can be activated to prevent anyone forcing their way in or out, unless they are possessing power on the level of the Thousand Master, Nagi Springfield, or his son Negi. To get out without your permission, people need to search in the dark for the few small exits."
15,400,Island Fortress,UQ Holder,Domain,"There’s a second big island out in the bay now. You’re now the owner of your own version of Fairyland Hall, the large island resort slash fortress that UQ Holder calls its’ home. It’s able to comfortably house several hundred people, since it is a luxury resort, and is covered in magical arrays that will keep all but the strongest warriors from stepping onto the shores uninvited. Armouries loaded with high power weapons, both magical and mundane, along with various defensive points and very large stores would allow one and a small army to hold out here for years against any invaders. It’s also a lovely place to look at and stay at, so if you want to actually use it as a resort as well, it’ll make a tidy profit to support your more clandestine activities. Companions may stay here beyond the usual limit but they may not leave the island. If you also buy the Underground Hideout and place it beneath here, your companions may stay beyond their limit there too.
"
16,400,Volcanic Island,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Domain,"Well, that’s one way to handle the ‘need to train
your Cosmo’ problem. This is a volcanic and absolutely hellish island with a hostile environment
and incredibly dangerous terrain. It also tends to erupt semi-regularly, though it somehow avoid
affecting the environment outside of it...maybe it’s a curse? Either way, training on this island
will help unlock a better understanding of both Cosmo and the ways of combat. This bonus also
applies to anyone you teach or train on said island. Just try not to get yourself killed early on.
Post-jump, this island either becomes a Warehouse attachment or you may have it rest on an
isolated spot in the nearest ocean."
17,400,The Fight Box,Saint Seiya Episode G,Domain,"You may not think very much of the Earth and its inhabitants but it’s often necessary to not just outright destroy it just as collateral. Thus you learn how to take your battles into a special place, one where you can fight as you please. You are able to bring everything within a few hundred feet of you to a pocket universe that your power created for your use. This dimension is, at the moment, merely the size of a galaxy and is largely empty of anything save for the odd star or lifeless rock floating about. As your power grows, so will the size of this dimension and the size of the space you can drag over to it. It is exceedingly difficult to escape from this dimension and any power used within will not leak out, leaving you free to fight at your best even when using attacks stronger than the size of this plane."
18,400,Personal Land,Saint Seiya Episode G,Domain,"Hidden from the eyes of even the Gods themselves, this is your personal Sanctuary. Impossible to find or get to for any you do not yourself purposefully lead to the place, it is a peaceful land of bountiful nature and ever-lasting calm. Being here is enough to calm even the most turbulent spirits and placate the most rageful souls, as well as to greatly aid any attempts to heal the wounded or sick. It is a safe place and quite large, measuring at least a dozen miles in each direction from the center and surrounded by thick natural barriers beyond that distance on all sides, such as dense forest or mountain ranges. The hide-away also includes a number of constructed buildings with simple supplies and furnishings. It might not be luxurious but it is certainly liveable and the nature around you should be luxury enough. The small area will retain any changes you make, in case you want to start a garden of your own or improve the homes here. In the future, you may have this place either within the world in a similar location or attached to your warehouse."
19,400,Bulwark of the Reclamation,Infernals Exalted,Domain,"The bulwark is a cyclopean basalt structure, a grand fortress reinforced with shining brass
and essence to be completely impervious to damage, and possessing a singular, heavy gate
of brass. Circular in shape, it surrounds a large open courtyard. It is staffed by a garrison of
warlike demons numbering in total six-hundred and fifty demonic soldiers, and headed by a
bound demon of the Second Circle. While most of the Bulwark is taken up by defences,
barracks for demonic armies, and training grounds, there are still luxurious rooms set aside
for the owner of the Manse and their guests.
More importantly perhaps, the center of the courtyard has been inlaid with circles of
vitriol-etched brass to form powerful host-binding circles in a sunburst motif. With these, you
may call forth many demons at once to serve in your hellish legions or even summon
Second Circle Demons during any normal night instead of only during the new moon.
Using the hearthstone it provides as a focus, you may even summon the Bulwark into
Creation or other worlds on the night of the new moon, as the brass circle expand outward
from you and the fortress walls will raise themselves in a new world to invade. Regrettably,
this summoning shall only work once every decade.
As a final measure, should this fortress ever be in danger of being taken by others... you,
and you alone, may start a self-destruct sequence which will cause the manse to build up
roiling essence and detonate in a brilliant explosion of green fire and radiant destruction that
annihilates everything within five miles. It shall reappear a year and a day after this, having
returned to attach to your warehouse with its demons reformed."
20,400,Monastery of Shifting Sands,Infernals Exalted,Domain,"This temple complex has been constructed entirely out of the silver sands of the Endless
Desert, which still flows as if the desert winds could blow them away at any moment. In this
way, the layout of the manse keeps changing. Opening a particular door at different times
can lead to different rooms, staircases going up can open onto lower floors should you tarry
too long. Sparse furniture and decorations of desert creatures of silver-metal wood and
Cecelyne glass are likewise moved by the shifting sands, never straying while being
watched, yet also never remaining when observers glance away. Despite its mercurial
nature, the Monastery itself will attempt to form itself in pleasing ways, forming shortcuts to
where you wish to go, lengthening the path of intruders, and deliberately moving the nicest
decorations into the room whenever you wish to impress visitors. Though it has only
rudimentary intelligence, it will comply with any requests you ask of it.
Perhaps far more impressive is the consecrated nature of this manse as a temple to the Yozi
without compare. For within its sand walls and the holy grounds up to five miles away from it,
prayer to the Yozi will be greatly enhanced, the acts of Yozi priests will be aided, and
servants of enemy powers like the Gods and the Chosen of Creation will not respire any
essence. They are unlikely to notice this inability to regain their essence though, for while
within range of the Monastery they shall be continually assaulted by flensing desert winds.
These winds could slay a mortal within minutes, and similarly flays the wills of those enemies
who do choose to stay, compelling they to leave as their will is eroded.
Finally, the manse may also sense anything within its holy grounds, whether spirit or
material, and may communicate the locations and shape of anything within five miles of the
structure by forming elaborate down-scaled replicas of its surroundings out of its sands.

Once every decade, the Monasteries’ hearthstone may be planted on top of a sandy area of
sufficient size, upon which the sands will turn as silver as Cecelyne and the manse will
slowly form itself there whilst disappearing from its previous location."
21,400,The Crystal Palace,Infernals Exalted,Domain,"Composed entirely of crystallized white light, formed into perfectly geometrical shapes, this
palace surrounds a central tower reaching into the sky, with circular private chambers
orbiting this in precise and harmonious patterns. Decorated as a royal palace fit for an entire
court, with geometric decorations and rainbow bands of color, it is a dwelling fit for a king or
queen of hell filled with symbols of mastery and order.
It resonates with the minds of those within, sensing the thoughts of sentient beings and
unsubtly overpowering their wills. It may be commanded to search visitor’s thoughts right
down to memories and report its findings to you by whispering in your mind with a demure,
crystalline voice. Likewise, it may control sentients within its walls, directing the activities of
any thinking creature not attuned to it. Though this can be resisted with a supernaturally
strong will or shaken off for a single moment with an act of will, most beings are made into
simple tools for it to use as you command it the limited intelligence contained in these
shining walls.
Furthermore, the throne room in the central tower has been inset with a pattern of emeralds,
sapphires, and diamonds to channel the manse’s Essence into sorcerous power. Any spell
cast within its wide halls requires much less essence to fuel itself and its effects will be
enhanced to greater heights than could be touched outside.
If you should desire this palace to be set somewhere else, you may shine upon its
hearthstone the light of your anima. Once every decade, it will act as a prism that scatters
rainbow light everywhere around to eventually coalesce into crystals walls of white light in a
brilliant display of beauty."
22,400,Residence of Shadows,Infernals Exalted,Domain,"A stately manor of of black and grey stone, cracked in many places, this particular mansion
is not much to look at. Literally, for as far as anyone outside can tell, it might as well not be
there. The geomancy of the building diverts the senses so subtly that one must literally
stumble upon it to find it. It gives no sensory impression, with the sole exception of touch and
even the land where it should be seems normal to observers. Even battles fought within
aren’t obvious, though geomancers and other sensitive to the flow of essence may notice its
presence. Even then, complicated geomancy and disguising of signs make it hard for
anyone to decipher the manse’s aspect or figure out anything at all about it. Even fate itself
finds it difficult to detect the building, as it is disguised from the eyes of heaven, and brought
outside fate.
Entering it rarely makes it easier, for the spiraling corridors, shadowy illumination, and
winding stairs found throughout the build make it easy to get lost in the essence-blurred
maze that is its interior. Traps, both benign and dangerous, are around nearly every corner,
and the shadowy flows of essence within make it hard to eavesdrop on other people and
every hamper scrying and other forms of distant perception. Even the anima light of the
Exalted would not help, for the fundamental property of active essence to has been carefully
removed from the reality within these walls. Only the spare lighting provided by the mansion
itself, or mundane torches may light the way of visitors.
Those aware of the building’s trick, on the other hand, can use the many secret passages
and hidden corridors within to subtly get around, quickly bypass much of the manse’s
dangers, or even use a hidden escape tunnel to escape should that be necessary. And thus
this Residence is the perfect hiding spot, a refuge for those of shadowy persuasion.
Should you require this dwelling at other places, you may hurl its hearthstone into a shadow
cast on a suitably open spot, once every decade. With your next step forward, you may then
pass the threshold of your Residence, to find your hearthstone deep within."
23,400,"Thaia yn Ebunma, the Leviathan",Infernals Exalted,Domain,"A behemoth-manse who looks much like a gigantic proto-whale, Thaia yn Ebunma was
created long ago in the Time of Glories as the prototypical ancestor of all those lesser
cetaceans. The size of a small city, she is a being capable of languidly swimming through
the seas of Kimbery and Creation alike. She is unbound by any particular location, for the
demesne she was formed around is her beating heart and will follow her wherever she goes.
Course hide and uncountable barnacle cover her form, while essence suffuses her tough
inner flesh. Even should her flesh be disturbed, she will regenerate from nearly anything and
stabilize her geomancy naturally. She may speak in low and slow tones reminiscent of the
song of whales, yet her ancient intelligent has also learned to speak in the many tongues of
demons and mortals, betraying a sentient mind of vast age and wisdom beyond even many

of the greatest gods and demons.
If anyone dares travel past her nacreous teeth and tongues of coral, she can provide air,
ample living space, and nourishing fruit from her own veined walls to let people life in
disturbing comfort. Mutagenic essence suffuses everything here, slowly transforming
unattuned beings into aquatic beings aligned with Kimbery over a period of many months.
Should you wish for her to come to you, only clasping her hearthstone and calling her name
in waters connected to an ocean is enough for her to surface moments later. This shall only
be guaranteed to work once a decade, but if it is done again sooner than that, then she will
simply do her best to swim towards your call with haste if at all possible."
24,400,Mansion of Mirrors and Briars,Infernals Exalted,Domain,"A stately manor composed entirely of twisting chrome trees and silvery thickets of briars, this
Mansion is filled with carefully-arranged mirrored surfaces and artful decorations. The
mirrors within show just slightly wrong reflections, showing grins and small movements
where there are none. This is small price to pay however, for the mirrors also reflect the
essence of everything within their sight, including immaterial spirits or invisible assailants.
Not only the mirrors are unusual, for minor tricks and confusing patterns fill the manse.
Strange mirrors exhaust the eye, normal methods of navigation don’t seem to work, opening
a particular door can lead to different rooms depending on the time, staircases going up can
open onto lower floors, even such features as windows or fireplaces might lead to new
places within the manse, and lost wanderers always finds themselves back at the doorstep.
After some time spend inside, residents eventually learn their way, and a small army of
demonic servants wander the halls to serve and entertain residents and guests alike.
Even the manse itself may not always be in the same spot, for its geomancy has been
arranged such that it may disappear once a day and reappear an hour later at one of
twenty-five different spots in the same realm of existence. Likewise, it can simply appear to
follow you at one of twenty-five spots in a new realm of existence every decade."
25,400,The Fortress That Moves,Infernals Exalted,Domain,"The first an observer notices about this manse is the rumbling noise it makes as it
approaches. A moving manse build upon a travelling demesne, it resembles nothing so
much as an absurdly massive fortress-wall serpent of midnight black stone, that snakes
through the world. The front of it burst with steam like a locomotive, as the interior of the
building is filled with titanic machinery and gears that may or may not be required for its
movement. It avoid the destruction of those things in its path by distorting space to shunt
away all that would be in its path. Ground, water and air part before it and flow around it like
a stream washing around a stone, carrying buildings, trees and players characters along for
the ride. Unbroken barriers warp like taffy to accommodate the manse’s movement, and
after it has passed, the warped space will return to their previous locations and shapes.
The titanic engine in the front is stoked by a mighty demon of the Second Circle descended
from the Black Boar, while it cannot leave the manse, it may help you as best as it can...
Which includes showing you to work the central controls built into this mighty engine. Should
you be willing to brave the grinding gears and steaming heat, you will find geomantic
controls to steer the demesne the moving fortress rides on. With these, you may roughly
pilot the manse itself towards your desired direction, for as long as you stay at the helm at
least. You may even disable the warping of space the manse uses the leave obstacles in its

path intact, but beware that you do not hit something that cannot be uprooted or torn apart
by the armored and nigh-indestructible train of doom you have been giving. For if that
happens, the Fortress would catch on it and halt, being dislodged from the demesne and
turning it into a static structure without the magical power it had as a moving manse.
Nevertheless, you may summon this manse again every decade by simply holding the
hearthstone up in the air, and commanding it to appear with an iron will. Should your call be
sufficiently adamant, it will steam over the horizon towards you at full speed."
26,400,The Terrace of Enlightenment,Infernals Exalted,Domain,"A brilliant terrace of alien stone and black nacre, ringed with alien plants and overcast by a
sky is as blank and white as an unwritten page, it is set upon the slopes of Qaf itself. A portal
rimmed with black nacre leads from and to this manse, allowing you to move into the space
occupied by the Heaven-Violating Spear. It’s portal is a gate to any particular realm, which
may be either Hell or Creation here. Completely invisible from the outside, the portal of black
nacre gives nary a shimmer in the air as it manifest by you.
Once in the manse itself, you may once again climb the slopes of Qaf and though you will
never find another terrace to leave to Malfeas, you may meet with infernal pilgrims who
likewise climb towards the impossible summit. On these slopes, you will learn much of
wisdom and enlightenment, but should you tire, you may retreat again to your terrace.
Delicious though alien grapes grow on the plants ringed the terrace, and fresh demon wines
spring eternally from clear fountains in the center of the terrace.
Towards the back of the great terrace, you may find a sizeable dojo, in which you may

practise your martial arts and meditative in undisturbed peace. In addition, the dojo is built
such that you may call forth the Third Circle demons of Qaf without waiting for the new
moon. However, as successfully summoned demon is not fully manifested, and is instead
bound to simply answer your questions and teach what lessons of understanding,
fundamental principles, and martial arts they know to you.
Should you find yourself in other worlds, then you may hold the hearthstone of the terrace
and meditate on the nature of perfection. You will then open your eyes to find the invisible
nacre gate of your terrace in front of you, though it will only be led to a new realm of
existence once every ten years."
27,400,The Sixfold Weave of Sublime Efficacy,Infernals Exalted,Domain,"Quite unlike the other manses on offer here, this is not actually a singular manse. Instead, it
is a network of six smaller manses arranged in an artful pattern of geomantic resonance,
empowering the central manse with the essence gleaned of the other five. Each created
from white brass and inlaid with black basalt, the five are formed into slender towers that
channel their essence towards the center, while on their own providing little more than a
luxurious abode and a minor hearthstone.
It is the central manse that is of most note to you, though it is still build up a weaker
demesne than the other manses you might acquire here, the difference is more than made
up for by the creative power funneled into it by the supporting manses. A palace of white
brass walls and ringed by streets of black basalt, it is a marvel to the eye built to be just as
aesthetically pleasing as it is functional. Her walls are decorated with frescoes bearing
differing images of the Mother of Creation and the demon princes descended from her,
fortified to withstand the greatest of sieges. Her halls are lit with purest white flames that
burn eternally, miniscule fragments taken from the flame that would become the Daystar’s
solar flames. Her rooms are furnished with wealth to bankrupt many princes, every need and
want you might have catered to by the servile intelligence of the manse itself, her only desire
to aid you. Even the essence of the manse adapts to make sure you are comfortable and
every small detail aligns in your favor.
And beyond all that, you will find many, many rooms filled with magnificent workshops for
every craft imaginable. Glassworking, pottery, smithing, painting, woodworking, jewelcrafting,
and many more. The manse itself will aid you with any project you wish to take on within
these halls, tools responding to your desires as eagerly as to your touch, and even gentle
advice given on any of your handiwork if you wish for another opinion.
Should you desire to, you may rearrange the flow of essence from the supporting manses to
another manse than this one, but in reaction the palace shall become still, unable to help you
as it wishes."
28,600,Holiday Home,UQ Holder,Domain,"With a click of your fingers, a hole appears in space before you. This is the gateway to your own private palace, situated in an enormous pocket dimension. The palace floats above a small world of its’ own, filled with all manner of fantastical creatures and plants. The palace itself is at least a few miles across in any direction, floating in the sky and being created with absolute luxury in mind. Countless powerful beasts roam the palace, guarding it from anyone you do not desire to give entry to. They cannot exit this world but make for a fearsome force if you can lure someone in. The palace contains almost any kind of room you can think of, from pools to libraries to game rooms to a suitable throne room too. Sadly, there is little of real power or magical knowledge to be found within the castle, though there is an abundance of valuable objects."
29,600,Pocket world,Cradle V1,Domain,"You gain an empty pocket world. Please create this in the traveler’s gate territory creation guide. You may instead gain a connection with any of the cannon Traveler’s gate territory but you luckily, are incapable of incarnation. Any territory from Elysium to Valinhall to Tartarus, go nuts."
30,600,Dawn Spring Archive,Cradle V1,Domain,"Your warehouse gains a door leading directly to the dawn spring archive, an organization and library filled with every path, technique and blood samples of every important person on cradle, so you craft your perfect path. comes with helpful staff who will help you formulate the best techniques and min max the hell out what ever you choose to do."
31,600,Samara’s Ring ,Cradle V1,Domain,"We’re actually selling this? Fine by me. You now own your own copy of the mountain and buildings of the Heaven’s Glory School. While the buildings and land are nice, the really important part is the ring itself, a giant bound circle of light madra that allows you to cycle light aura at anytime of day or night. You can choose to summon the mountain by you anytime, just be wary of where you’re placing a mountain. If it gets destroyed or broken, you can’t summon it by you for a year and a day. This can be part of your warehouse after this jump or will found somewhere in your next jump. Any personnel with the school (students, teachers elders, remnants) and you can upgrade it."
32,600,Elder’s labyrinth,Cradle V1,Domain,"You gain a copy of the ancient, possibly endless labyrinth that has entrances everywhere in the world. Filled to the brim with Archlord and above relics from the shallowest depths, it will agitate the Dreadgods if you take anything from here within the jump, but after this jump, you are free to plunder to your hearts content, and it will update with treasures from every world you will visit or have visited. Like a less convenient gate of Babylon. If you can conquer in the ten years’ time, then I will condense it into something more resembling a second warehouse so you can more easily access everything."
33,600,Sanctuary,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Domain,"You’ve acquired your own piece of Sanctuary, a
collection of Greek-style temples that act as the fortress for Athena and her Saints, personalized
for you and any companions you have. The building is strong enough to withstand an exchange
of blows between the Gold Saints, and will remain hidden from sight should you do wish it.
Post-jump, you may place the Sanctuary in a place outside of civilization of your choosing, or
make it into a Warehouse attachment"
34,600,Underwater Temple,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Domain,"Located within an air pocket deep in the
bottom of the ocean is an Underwater Temple, styled almost identically to the one that Poseidon
and his seal rest within. It can withstand anything short of a planet-destroying attack and is
comfortable to live within as well - sea life will avoid or outright ignore the bubble of safety
around it. Post-jump, this may become a Warehouse attachment or set down in an oceanic
bubble of your choosing. Regardless, you may access it at any time simply by diving
somewhere into the ocean with the intent to go there - the currents will shift and you will reach
your destination in a short amount of time, regardless of distance."
35,600,Castle of the Dead,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Domain,"This is a tall, stone castle that is in ruin and in
need of repair...though that is not what is special about it. In a hidden room, there is a trapdoor
with a deathly chill, and following it will take you to an isolated pocket of the Underworld, a land
full of the dead without a sun shining above. Despite this, the oppressive air almost feels
soothing to you and your companions, and there is a fully-completed and luxurious castle -
identical to the one on the surface - waiting for you below, with a repertoire of skeletal servants
and guards looking after it for you. While the rest of the Underworld beyond your castle is
inaccessible post-jump, you may set this property down in any isolated location, or use it as a
Warehouse attachment as per normal."
36,600,Sanctuary ,Saint Seiya Omega,Domain,"You now possess a replica of the Sanctuary, a stunning assembly of Greek-style
temples serving as the bastion for Athena and her devoted Saints. This
stronghold exhibits unparalleled resilience, capable of withstanding the chaos of
a thousand wars without faltering. Moreover, the Sanctuary retains its ability to
remain concealed, shrouded from the sight of those who may seek to uncover its
secrets, ensuring its continued secrecy and safeguarding its occupants."
37,600,Heavengazer Tower,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Domain,"One of the rarest treasures in the vast expanse of the Three
Realms are treasures that bend time. This particular one, under the name of Heavengazer Tower,
allows its user to manipulate time so it flows up to a thousand times faster while they are inside its
Major-World sized expanse, allowing for lightning-quick training. Normally, this treasure would
require an amount of power that increases exponentially compared to what degree the flow of time
is manipulated, but this one seems to be outfitted with formations that draw from the energy of the
Primordial Chaos itself, and as such the owner needn’t concern themselves with any energy
requirements, allowing them to concentrate completely on their training. You can manipulate the
environment in here, but can't form living things, food, or items of sustenance."
38,600,Alchemical Haven,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Domain,"This is a plot of land about three hundred and fifty thousand
square miles large that would keep getting bigger to accommodate additional plants, accessible

through a door in your warehouse. Inside this dimension, you will find soil that adapts itself to
grow whatever is planted in it, and an atmosphere that will change itself to meet the demands of
each and every plant as needed, transforming some areas into barren, frozen wastelands, and others
into fiery hellholes. To add to this, the Alchemical Haven automatically harvests fruits and replants
seeds, meaning that the only intervention needed for it to stay operational is the introduction of
new seeds. It can even speed up time for some plants so that they can be planted and harvested as
much as you wish. However, this only works when there are no sentient beings within the
dimension. Before you plant anything, there are several mortal ranked fruits and spiritual grasses
already planted and matured for you to use that altogether may allow you to enter the Zifu stage, if
you already possess the required insights."
39,600,Clan Estate-World,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Domain,"This estate-treasure comes in any shape you wish, from a ring to a necklace. Inside, there is a
space the size of a Chaosworld, filled with homes, cities, and supplies capable of supporting a
large population of clansmen. You may also teleport any of your clan members to any location

into this world (assuming they’re not stronger than you of course)."
40,600,Heavengazer Tower MK.II,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Domain,"A far more advanced version of the Heavengazer Tower of Radiance, this version allows you to
accelerate time up to a million times with no energy drain in you or the Chaosverse. The world
on the inside is at the size of a Chaosworld, and any restrictions on food and sustenance being

formed on the inside are now also gone."
41,600,Overtechnology: Cosmic Workshop,Avesta of Black and White,Domain,"Like the Workshop of Annihilation, you have a particular talent when it comes to creation of extraordinary tools. Unlike him, you are not limited to just producing tools that will be used as weapons or to bring forth destruction, but you also don’t have his entire galaxies worth of resources, at least not just with this.

Still, the wonders that you create are nothing to scoff at. These tools are capable of violating the very laws of reality, bringing forth effects that even Commandments and the Power of Ego struggle to replicate. A small coffin where time doesn’t move on, an armor that feeds on emotions to regenerate the user and itself from any kind of wound, or even more sinister and stranger creations are in your reach. The only things needed to bring them forth are your dedication and the precise resources for such wonder.

Finally, the technology that you create always works based on the principles that you use to make it, regardless of what the local laws of reality are, and it works flawlessly to fulfill its mission."
42,600,Jumper-Emperor Realm,A Will Eternal,Domain,"You are the creator and owner of the starry sky. Well, a starry sky. This is your own personal
pocket dimension, with the potential to grow to be massive in size and filled with basic plant
and animal life. The exact appearance and layout of this realm is somewhat malleable and
up to you to decide. Do you wish for an endless desert, dotted with spiritual wells as
Oasis’s? A gigantic ocean with islands scattered about? It’s up to you. The size of this world
will grow with your own power. At Qi condensation, it wouldn’t be much larger than a small

hut. By the time you reach the level of Archaean it would be about equal to that of the Arch-
Emperor Realm. Contained within a five meter tall statue of Jumper is this land, with people

being able to enter by simply placing their hand on it and channelling spiritual energy.
Leaving is similarly as easy as channelling ones spiritual energy in a set pattern, akin to a
‘key’. Alternatively you could set a Gravekeeper, an artificial being born of the realms
spiritual power, as the guardian, who decides who may enter or leave the realm, other than
those you whitelist."
