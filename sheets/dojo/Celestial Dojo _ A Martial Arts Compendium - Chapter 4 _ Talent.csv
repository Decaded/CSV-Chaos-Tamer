1,50,Natural Elegance,Baki The Grappler,Talent,"You possess impeccable manners, allowing you to fit in and thrive in any formal setting, even as a towering mound of muscle and bloodlust. This also lets you effortlessly handle any elaborate upkeep on your appearance, whether it be your wardrobe, makeup, hairstyle, etc."
2,50,Welcome to the Auction,Dragon Ball,Talent,"Auctioneers need to be knowledgeable and more importantly charismatic to do their
jobs. Good auctioneers are masters of wording and can make worthless items seem

invaluable. You seem to have a natural talent for putting on a performance and
enthralling others. You could convince someone to buy a rock that you literally picked up
off the ground in front of them. Additionally, you possess an exquisite voice perfectly
suited for running an auction. Lastly, no matter how fast you speak your words will be
perfectly understandable."
3,50,Particularly Exalted,Generic Exalted,Talent,"Normally an individual that is Exalted tends to excel at one of the
three attribute groups of physical, mental, or social. The second group is slightly above average,
and the final category is merely average. You however are particularly multi-talented, and have
the good fortune to excel at the physical, mental, and social aspects all at the same time, with
no functional difference between them. The reason this is so cheap is because these things are
nothing you couldn’t have just trained up yourself given some time and effort, however it does
give you a fair advantage in the early run of things, especially since some charms require higher
attributes before they can be learned."
4,100,Put On A Show Darling,UQ Holder,Talent,"You learnt to keep yourself entertained, now you’ve learnt how to entertain everyone around you. You’re an excellent performer, with skills ranging from acrobatics to singing to a variety of musical instruments. Perhaps you spent a few years in the circus. Why, you even learnt how to automatically summon minor special effects around you when you strike a pose, say something cool, or just want to have some ready-made SFX. The performing experience has of course made you quite good at disguising yourself or pretending to be something that you aren’t, though this is far from foolproof."
5,100,Guidance,Cradle V1,Talent,"When you are taught by those who have achieved mastery in whatever skill they’re trying to teach you, your learning speed doubles. In addition, you have a 6th sense for finding those who can teach you to master new skills."
6,100,Creativity,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Talent,"One of the things that sets humanity apart from the other races is how creative they are. They create entire stories and worlds in their head. You embody this aspect. The thoughts you have, the worlds and stories you create, are so creative and vibrant they are lifelike."
7,100,Resourcefulness,"A Cultivator's Beginning",Talent,"You instinctively know how to make the best with what you have.

You understand how to use your abilities and resources at hand in creative ways that many would not have considered, potentially giving you an advantage against more rigid or less creative opponents."
8,100,Civilian Skills,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Talent,"You find it exceedingly easy to apply your martial arts skills to
mundane tasks. Leg strength developed through repeated kicking and great leaps could be
applied to travel faster, engaging in acts of parkour. Alternatively powerful punches, tight grasps
and natural leverage techniques could be used to engage in acts of construction or repair. You
will find innumerable uses when you begin applying your martial arts to everyday life."
9,100,Perfectly Trained,Baki The Grappler,Talent,"They say someone who loves what they do will never work
a day in their life. What you love is training. You love the
sweat, the aching, the exhaustion. To that end, you’ve
gotten good at seamlessly working your training into daily
life, whether it be shadowboxing to kill time or practicing
footwork when going out for a walk."
10,100,Showmanship,Street Fighter,Talent,"You fight for more than yourself, you fight to entertain the fans! Their cheers
of excitement are just as important as beating in the face of your challenger! What's a good match
without a hyped up audience?
 This perk really helps with exciting and dazzling onlookers as you show off your skills, allowing you
to really pump up the crowd and get an active mood in your current venue. This doesn't even have
to apply to fighting, your showman skills work just as well with getting people's blood pumping over
varying sports, competitions and other skill based activities with an audience."
11,100,Ingenuity,Toriko,Talent,"Necessity is the mother of invention and sometimes life just refuses to deal you a good hand. Regardless of their field, these are the people who know how to turn an adverse situation to their advantage and make the most of whatever material they have on hand.
"
12,100,Gourmet World Chef,Toriko,Talent,"You now have the know-how to cook amazing meals from common ingredients and the skills to make something from stranger ingredients. Not everyone knows how to prepare Fried Dough Corn, how to butcher a Crab Pig, or bring out the full flavor of a Seven Flavor Turkey but now you do! You have enough talent to now cook anything found in the Human World and a good chance of cooking anything from the Gourmet World.
After leaving this Jump, this skill gives you a general idea on how to prepare other exotic ingredients from other worlds and how to cook them.
"
13,100,Medical Training,Toriko,Talent,The basics of human anatomy and medical training are yours to utilize. Field Surgery isn't out of the question for you. First Aid is second nature to you and it's easier to keep people in tip top shape.
14,100,Hidden In the Shadows,Saint Seiya Omega,Talent,"For the past 13 years, the Martians have operated covertly, clandestinely
infiltrating and renovating the Sanctuary in preparation for the grand unveiling of
their master plan. Drawing upon your innate abilities as a master of stealth, you
possess the uncanny skill to create or renovate buildings with utmost discretion
or any plan in motion, even in plain sight, without fear of discovery."
15,100,Charade,Saint Seiya Omega,Talent,"You possess a remarkable talent for maintaining a charade, adept at convincingly
feigning allegiance or beliefs that diverge from your true intentions. Whether it
involves pretending to worship a god or assuming a false identity, you possess
the ability to uphold this facade with unwavering commitment until your very last
breath."
16,100,Up on the Podium,Saint Seiya Episode G,Talent,"You’ll never need cue cards against, for you’ve got a fantastic, long winded speech ready for almost any situation, the sort of stuff that genuinely inspires courage and wards away fear and worry. You’ve got a fantastic, clear voice for those speeches too, able to carry across even the din of battle between Saints and their foes."
17,100,Taking On The Guise,Saint Seiya Episode G,Talent,"It may not be terribly fitting for your status as a divine being but there are times when putting up a pretence can work to your advantage. You've got quite the skill with disguising yourself and your abilities, as just anyone other than yourself or as specific people. Obviously this will be helped along with props and costumes but you've got almost any kind of voice or motion imitation down pat, so long as you can hear or observe the person you're trying to make yourself sound or look like.

"
18,100,Lil Schemer,Feng Shen Ji,Talent,"You’ve become good at creating short term plans and even improvising on the fly. Able to account for the resources/obstacles, locations and environments, and to prepare for most unknown factors that may put a hiccup in any of your schemes. Become the perfect coordinator for strike teams or any heists you take on in less than a month to complete."
19,100,Dedicated Training,Fist Of The North Star,Talent,"You know the secret to being strong and not only have you under gone
the training needed to become as powerful as the local masters of martial arts, but you can put other
people through this training. They may not know how to fight just because of this training, but in pure
physical ability they'll be incredible."
20,100,Desperate,Fist Of The North Star,Talent,"- Everything is scarce in this world, mercy, shelter, food, and hope. But you don't
care about that, you can make do with whatever you can find. Those tattered scraps of leather can be
made into a nice jacket, that pan with a hole in the bottom would make a nice piece of armor, and a
handful of rice seeds could be a meal for the night. You are a master at stretching supplies beyond
reasonable limits and making things from sub-par materials, you can even perfectly repair simple
things so long as you have all the pieces. Just because your jacket got torn to shreds doesn't mean you
can't fix it up good as new in your spare time."
21,100,Natural Talent,Fist Of The North Star,Talent,"In both body and mind you are simply better than others. You learn quicker
and remember more while your physical training is more effective, showing improvements in less time
and making gains faster. It isn't much, perhaps just 1.1 times what your should have, but for someone
with drive even that small edge can be an overwhelming advantage in the long run."
22,100,Recognition of Patterns,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Talent,"You are talented in
discerning patterns, this allows you to quickly and accurately
figure out puzzles and to decode complex patterns. Useful for
figuring out what an inscription should do without activating it."
23,100,Survival Before all Else,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Talent,"As a tribesman, you’ve faced enough
hardships, watching member after member of your tribe die due to one issue or another, for you to
get a firm grasp on what was needed to survive in this world. Thus, your abilities to survive out in
the wilderness of the Grand Xia continent, and more importantly, against the Diremonsters that
inhabit it, is tremendous. You have learned to hide yourself, your scent, as well as various other
things such beasts would use to track you, all the while remaining comfortable and making camp.
In the future, you may do the same for other beasts found in the multiverse. If they have any senses
apart from physical ones, be prepared to fight, unless you have developed measures to counter
those sense via other means."
24,100,Observant,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Talent,"Years spent in this Universe has taught you much. One of those greatest lessons is the
importance of your perception. Whether it be of a technique, or a location, your ability to notice
small details is enough that if in a battle against someone equal to your strength, you’d be able to
find a flaw in their technique or personality based on simply a few exchanges."
25,100,Linguistically Talented,Trinity Wonder,Talent,"Among other things, different worlds have different languages. Given that they are completely separate universes, there is no guarantee that these languages will share any kinds of roots or have similarities. This doesn’t matter so much for you. Much like Emily and Wujin, you are shockingly talented when it comes to picking up new languages that you’ve never encountered before. With a guide to help, you would be able to speak in broken form of that language within a day. Within a week you would only have a faint accent."
26,100,Needle and Thread,Bleach,Talent,"The bad guys always have the best looks going for them. It doesn’t come from nowhere, at least not
for the Quincy. Stitching and weaving is a bit of a pastime for many of their number, so skills like
yours are far from out of place. The talents of the thread and needle are well developed, from
designing new outfits and making comfortable clothes from the designs, to creating stuffed toys or
modifying existing fabrics. And no matter how impossible it may seem, you can quickly and easily
embed the Quincy Cross onto anything with a bit of thread. Even metal, somehow. Given their
militaristic outlook, it’s also apparent that you know how to turn a needle and thread into a deadly
weapon, whether directly or in how it improves your use of thread-like techniques quite significantly.
If you could get a handle on Ransotengai, who knows what they’d let you do to the enemy. "
27,100,Academic Foundation,Bleach,Talent,"Clever girl, aren’t you? It’s no real surprise you took the path of the scientist, with everything there is
to discover. In one world alone, there are endless wonders, but in all three? Marvels are waiting to
be made. A rookie still but not one without potential, you’ve got moderate experience in a wide
range of scientific disciplines. Biology, physics, engineering and a particular education in spiritual
theories unique to the afterlives. Reishi doesn’t always work like atoms do but you know the
differences and even have a few lessons on how exactly you go about making use of them all. You’ve
got an adept mind for science and it comes easier to you but there’s a long road ahead."
28,100,"Doctor, Doctor",Bleach,Talent,"Every being fears death. Pain, too. It’s only natural to shrink back from the things that hurt us. And
maybe it’s only natural to be drawn towards the ones that cleanse that pain. Every race has it’s own
carers and while you’re not yet a master, you are still a Doctor. For your particular species, you’re
fully trained as both doctor and surgeon to care for them. Inexperienced, sure, but still
knowledgeable and able to help. You’ll have a good understanding of mundane methods of healing
wounds with real world medicine as well as a decent training in several lesser Healing Kidou or your
race’s equivalent abilities. A Hollow might instead rely on biological mutations or mixtures. You’ve
also got a decent bedside manner, enough to at least get normally hostile patients to let you have a
quick look and listen to your suggestions for a while. Sometimes it’s more helpful than actually
knowing how to heal, with some of these warrior types."
29,100,Officer in the Making,Bleach,Talent,"Despite the individualistic nature of war in the afterlife, it’s still important to have good leaders. Officers are more than just the stronger weapons, they’re the ones meant to manage everyonebeneath them in the chain of command. You’re capable at the task in both war and peacetime, beingan effective tactical commander of small units and able to keep your men from causing too much of a fuss when there’s no fights to be had. The extensive experience in handling paperwork of all kinds, even the most obtuse and obviously pointless, is just a natural extension of what it means to be a leader. "
30,100,Model Student ,Tsukihime,Talent,"If you find yourself regularly skipping class to go on nighttime hunts for vampires or just general adventure, then it pays to be a good student on paper if nothing else. You're a model student, soaking up what teachers say like a dry sponge and speed reading your required studies in but an hour. You learn about twice as quickly as other top students, absorbing academic and mundane skills with very little trouble, even on a time crunch. Supernatural teachings or things like complicated science takemore time, but you’re still an excellent learner as long as you have a good teacher - whether an actual mentor or a very informative book.
"
31,100,Masked,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Talent,"A proper ninja does not reveal themselves until it’s too late for the enemy to do anything about
it. Not their true power, and certainly not whatever they’re feeling.
You are now a master role-player and infiltrator, capable of putting on a flawless act that could
fool anyone short of the most discerning and perceptive people alive, and often even them.
You’ll never even hint at possessing any ability or knowledge you couldn’t reasonably be
expected to have. Neither will you ever express a visible emotion that you don’t want to. And
unlike many long-term infiltrators you will never ‘lose yourself’ in a role or emotionally confuse
a cover identity for the real you.
You could easily spend your entire life since infancy pretending to be the village idiot while
actually having the power and knowledge to beat up a Kage, and leave everybody none the wiser.
In addition, you have exceptional talent at both henge and mundane disguises."
32,100,Let’s Go Hero,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Talent,"To be a hero, you need to be a complete package. Fighting? It’s useful. You’re good at it too, enough
to handle ordinary soldiers in small groups on your own well enough or take down a minor magical
beast or five at once, but that’s not enough. Being a hero is about adventure and that’s where you’re
shining. You’ve got a wide array of skills when it comes to exploring and adventuring, from
acrobatics and navigation of land and sea to organising expeditions and how to sell off all the
treasure you find. In later times, you could definitely make a name for yourself as a great discoverer. Helps that you’re an able seaman, horseman and can handle weeks or months long travels without a
problem. You’re great at adapting to the strange things you’re likely to encounter on your journeys
as well, since thinking outside of the box, particularly when it comes to using magical or superhuman
solutions to things, comes naturally to you. Some people might not think of rerouting an entire river
just to clean some stables but you? You’re the smart cookie that can figure out how. "
33,100,Once Every Century,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Talent,"Talent that comes only once in a hundred years might stand out at the time but against the expanse
of history? It just means there’s been a dozen or two others like that already. World class talent
might be the peak of what normal human’s can do but it’s just the start for those in the magical
world. Like the famed Salieri and his music, you have that world class talent in one art form of your
choosing. Singing, the piano, painting, architectural design, acting or some other method. With just
this and the right connections, you could certainly go down in the history of the mundane as one of
the greatest performers of your art to ever live. But you’ve got the potential to go further, as you
find yourself having a moderately easier time learning magical spells and abilities closely associated
with your chosen art, as well as such things becoming easier to use and somewhat more powerful as
well. Magic cast through a special instrument of the musical art you’ve mastered would be stronger, whereas a great painter would find magic relating to manipulating paintings and drawn images to be
significantly better for them than any others."
34,100,Prodigious,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Talent,"The core of an artist is their art. One can hardly claim to matter in the art world if you’re not at least
proficient in some form of art, so you’ll have at least a little talent to get by on. A little, of course, being relative. Whether it be a kind of music, a form of visual expression, a manner of writing or
some strange way to create art, you’ll find you have quite the talent at one such thing. You’d be a
noted prodigy in any of the artistic schools around Europe and with years of effort, might one day be
able to claw your way up to the world stage. Your impressive talents do, one must admit, lie more
outside just performance. However it takes form, you have even more talent at turning your art to
combat than you do making beauty with it. A violin that somehow becomes a lethal sword, songs
that can be used to transmit magical spells to many targets at once. You have a talent for taking art
to a deadly and/or magical level, both what you already specialise in and what else you might learn
in the future."
35,100,Cooking Specialty,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"You have mastered a specific type of cooking. Some examples could be grilling, soups, braising, or anything else you can think of. You gain the experience of a master chef in your chosen speciality. By choosing braising you would learn the proper methods to work with any type of meat and the best equipment to use in virtually any scenario. You can buy this multiple times for different specialties. Only the first purchase will be free if you use a discount on this perk.
"
36,100,Let me Give You a Tip,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"While you may be talented in a particular field that doesn’t mean that you actually have the ability to teach. This perk grants you the teaching skills needed to properly pass down your skills. As long as you actually put in the effort to teach them they will be capable of quickly developing. This may accelerate the rate they learn, but if they are not talented in their field it will still take some time for them to properly comprehend your skills. "
37,100,Troublemakers Will Be Stripped,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"One of the quirks that Bu Fang’s Puppet Whitey has is that anytime someone causes trouble in the store he would strip them and throw them out of the store. This perk makes you just as skilled as Whitey when it comes to striping others. Now you may be wondering why this is useful. This effect will work on any clothing and armor as well as being able to bypass any defensive artifacts. So you can use this both to embarrass others and as an actual combat technique. The only restriction is that you can’t do this to beings significantly stronger than you.
"
38,100,Immaculate Control,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"Whether it is controlling your energy while cooking or maintaining the flow behind one of your attacks it is important to possess control over your power. This perk grants you perfect control over any energy and power you possess. You will be capable of making incredibly precise measurements and you will not waste any energy while using a technique. This also allows you to focus all of your might behind one point amplifying your strength.
"
39,100,Dutiful,Beware Of Chicken,Talent,"Expectations, duties, these are things all have to deal with, even the heir to
a Sect. And you rose to the occasion. You are quite simply good at being a
Young Mistress/Master. Everything one in your position would be expected
to do, you have a modest Talent at. You won’t be wowing anyone from
another province if you don’t work at it, but compared to your peers in the
Azure Hills, few if any can match you. This optionally comes with over the
top acting to make little brothers laugh."
40,100,Extraordinary Affinity,Against The Gods,Talent,"You have extraordinary talent for one of the elements of nature,
from Fire, Water, Earth, Lightning and Wind. While nowhere close to what someone with an Evil
God’s Seed would have, like, at all, you are still along the top 1% most talented people in that
element in the world.
You can buy up to Five of these, and while normally trying to learn Profound Arts of two or more
elements would be more counter-productive than anything else, but elements bought here don’t
ever conflict, and indeed, complement each other wherever possible."
41,100,Shadow Demon’s Secret Retaining,Against The Gods,Talent,"You are a virtually unmatched expert when it comes
to the art and science of information suppression. Be it the methods of rooting out spies, simple
disguise or concealment or whatever, if you’re trying to hide something, a person, an item or just
some news, it’s very, very difficult for it to get out."
42,100,Wielder of the Golden Rule,Against The Gods,Talent,"It’s surprising what all the simple power of Money can still
make people do. You know it better than most, of course. You are a profound genius when it comes
to the arts of bribery, favor trading and corruption.
You know just what someone would most likely want for something, and what they will be willing to
take. You’re used to throwing your money around and getting results."
43,100,Management Elder,Against The Gods,Talent,"It takes a lot of work to keep immortal kung-fu wizards in pills and
medicines and weapons, y’know. Someone has to know how to balance an account, how to trade
and setup businesses, and all the necessary infrastructural work. That’s you now.

You’re nothing short of an utter wizard at all things financial, logistical ands managerial. You know
the nuts and bolts of bargaining and negotiation. You can tell the true value of anything you look at
at first glance, and know just how to bargain the opposing party down or up to it. You understand
how to make and manage alliances with other sects, how to setup businesses and industries, go
about properly setting up a distribution schedule for the weapons your sect acquires... and
everything else required to keep such a force running."
44,100,Scholar At Heart,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Talent,"Many people might try to become a scholar, a person of knowledge and learning, but not many
would become truly noteworthy as such. The people who become famous scholars though,
they all share a certain thing. A love of learning and understanding things.
Now you have this as well. Learning new things, discovering new concepts and understanding
how things function is fulfilling for you on a deeply profound level. Even if you have nothing
else in life that brings you joy, you will always have this love of learning and understanding.
Of course, enjoyment isn’t everything. You need a good memory too, to remember all of the
things you will learn. You will never forget anything and all of the information you absorb will
be perfectly sorted and effortless to recall. Of course, if you feel the need to forget something
for whatever reason then you may still choose to do so."
45,100,Gift Of Gab,A Will Eternal,Talent,"Your tongue is nearly as sharp as your sword, and sometimes it feels like it can do more
damage too. You have quite the ability to talk your way around people, leaving them with
little option but to do as you wish, whether by their choice or not. Your arguments hit the nail
on the head time and time again, leaving no chance for your opponents to retort against the
facts. Should you turn your tongue to insults, those on the receiving end will quickly grow red
with indignant rage."
46,100,Frugal,A Will Eternal,Talent,"There is a rather famous phrase: ‘Money makes the world go round’. How can one possibly
afford all the different cultivation materials they require if they have no money? Often, a
powerful cultivator is a wealthy one. Many times this is because they are able to sell their
valuable goods and services. Other times it’s because they are wealthy that they are
powerful. Either way, it is undeniable that power and money are somewhat linked. As such,
you’ve learned to be very skilful at maximising your profits. You’ve learned to find corners of
the market that are waiting to be filled with superior products, learned to make the most
money from the least amount of work. Some might call it unethical, you call it smart."
47,100,Savant,Generic Exalted,Talent,"You're a Savant! This means you've got an incredible insight in crafting all sorts
of things, from meals, to clothes, to armor, to weapons, to magical devices, and all sorts of other
things besides. Even if you've never done something before so long as it's a skill remotely 'craft
like' in nature you'll be able to perform it at the level of a (mortal) master. This just represents
innate talent, and if you actually focus on developing such skills the normal way you'll quickly
outstrip even the best that a mortal craftsman could accomplish, able to make artwork that
speaks to the soul (perhaps literally) or armor and weapons of surpassing quality that look like
show-room pieces despite being suitable for combat and also being sturdy and reliable to a
frankly unbelievable degree. Purchasing this will even make you substantially better than other
Exalted craftsmen, assuming you put in the same amount of effort that they did."
48,100,Savvy Snake Method,Generic Exalted,Talent,"You're a scheming bastard, able to think around all sorts of foes
and capable of turning the tables on your enemies so long as they aren't massively superior to
you in some fashion. Additionally you're also quite skilled at preventing people from realizing
you're doing it (unless you want them to know, of course). Keep in mind if you're a mortal
basically every Exalt and most magical creatures are massively superior to you in some fashion.
If you are an Exalt however then you've got the potential to be one of the best schemers around.
This represents natural cunning, not learned cunning. Combined with actual experience you
might one day be able to sell a man snake-oil even after directly telling him it was snake-oil."
49,100,Fantastical Destiny Enactment,Generic Exalted,Talent," Otherwise known as role playing. You are ludicrously
good at playing a given role. You will never give away or hint at anything that the role you are
playing at couldn’t reasonably know or do, and no method can be used to discern otherwise
until and unless you personally do something to suggest otherwise. Which you wouldn’t,
because you’re that good. Naturally playing all kinds of roles could get confusing, as you lose
yourself amongst the many faces you wear. Not for you though, you have no issues maintaining
even the deepest of covers for years, perhaps even decades or centuries, and can easily drop
them whenever you need to and go right back to being your ‘primary’ identity. Or perhaps even
a different role, yet another layer in the deception that you weave.
Naturally you couldn’t actually do these things if you weren’t actually good at acting, so this perk
also provides you with a fair amount of skill in performance and presence, letting you ‘sell’ the
mask so to speak"
50,100,Gregarious Ruler’s Disposition,Generic Exalted,Talent,"You know how to Rule and how to Lead. Delegation,
training, leadership, how to put your best foot forward, how to present yourself, how to carry
yourself, how to speak authoritatively, all these and more shine through and show your natural
and destined abilities as a ruler. You will find all matters of governance come to you easily and
you will always be able to carry on and act in a manner as befits your station. People that
interact with you will naturally gravitate towards following your commands, and if you are a part
of a group where there is a question of who should lead you will always be viewed as the
favorite unless there is a clear and obvious reason to pick someone else. Individuals you
personally train will be instilled with incredible loyalty towards you, and will learn and retain
information and skills you teach them at a rate far beyond what they might normally have been
capable of.
As Solars were the leaders of the Exalted host it is both their nature and their duty to lead vast
armies of their lessors, and you too now share this. Further you also gain keen insight on how
best to consolidate such positions, or how to gain them in the first place if you don't already
possess them. Let no one question your Mandate to Rule."
51,100,Respect Commanding Attitude,Generic Exalted,Talent,"Similar to the charm of the same name when you
speak others listen. They do not heckle, they do not interrupt, and they do not attempt to punch
you in the face halfway through your first word. They won’t necessarily care about what you are
saying, but they won’t interrupt you while you are saying it. Naturally if you start attacking people
while speaking they’ll defend themselves. Unlike the charm of the same name however you do
not need to expend essence in order to power this ability, it simply being an innate facet of your
nature.
More importantly though is that you may now continue to speak, or start speaking, even in the
heat of battle allowing you to use your way with words to continue your verbal assault upon your
foes, condemning and castigating them. Or, if you’re trying for something less antagonistic, you
may instead attempt to reach them through diplomacy, convincing them that fighting is not the
answer and instead to settle things through peaceful discourse. This doesn’t guarantee you’ll be
successful in your words, of course, but unlike most you can actually continue trying for
diplomacy even after the daiklaves have cleared their scabbards."
52,100,Glorious Golden Smug Technique,Solars Exalted,Talent,"You are a Solar Exalt, among the Chosen of the Sun
and the mightiest of all the Exalted. Thus, you’re well within your rights to feel secure about your
superiority and the advantage it gives you...but must you be so smug about it? Whether or not
you’ve let this go to your head, you are frighteningly good at rubbing your station in the face of
others - whether it be your Exaltation, your accomplishments, or just the huge gap in
competence between you and those you speak to. Those weaker than you will feel discouraged
and likely sink into despair, while your equals and better are more easily provoked by the desire
to punch your smug face in. Which, as a bonus, you are very good at making such expressions.
You won’t even need words to communicate how smug you are and how much better you know
you are."
53,100,Pages and Words,Solars Exalted,Talent,"There are few things more powerful than knowledge and how to use it.
Creation is full of oddities and hidden lore that can take decades of study to fully understand.
Luckily, you have a bit of help with this - given about a day at most, you can quickly study and
learn all public knowledge about an area you’re in simply through investigation and reading -
everything from cultural norms to where the best shops are. Things that are hidden or secret
must be investigated normally, but when you understand all that is ‘normal’ about somewhere,
all that’s left to do is spot the uncommon. You’re also now an incredible speed-reader, to boot -
you can read a large encyclopedia from front-to-back in minutes. You may instead read a bit
more slowly if you prefer to sit down and enjoy the read, of course."
54,100,Infinite Graves Born of Fingers White and Red,Abyssals Exalted,Talent,"All of the Abyssal Exalted are meant the slay the world itself, to plunge Creation wholly into
the Underworld and see the Underworld itself sucked down into the Abyss. But of all the
Deathknights, it is those of the Dusk Caste who do so most directly. Whether they be deadly
warriors or murderous warlords, each of them is a killer of surpassing skill.
You possess that same lethal talent, your skill at arms allowing you to be the martial
backbone of whatever circle you join, able to pick up any weapon you please and use it with
both elegant skill and merciless lethality. Perhaps it is a gory sort of utility, but quite a lot of
problems can be solved with murder, because the simple fact is that there is always
someone who needs killing."
55,100,Razor Wit Cutting through Blissful Ignorance,Abyssals Exalted,Talent,"Deathknights of the Daybreak Caste are ingenious without a doubt, seeking absolute
knowledge for themselves even as they twist that knowledge to send Creation toward a dark
age of savage ignorance. No secret can hide from their inquisitive minds; no dark miracle
evades their clutching grasp. Pitiless clarity is their tainted gift to the world, helping those
blinded by passion to see the coldly calculated truths that advance some greater design.
They are the learned and the inquisitors, the Unclean who see the Black Exaltation as the
ultimate means to gather knowledge and practice their crafts until time itself ends. Few
concern themselves with the morality of the knowledge they seek. Yours is such a genius, a
mind as sharp as a Soulsteel blade and as learned as any library. In your hunger for
knowledge, unraveling mysteries in your research and plundering knowledge for yourself
comes as second nature."
56,200,Heat of the Voice,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Talent,"Some heroes from myths across the Wheel talk about heroes who could whip an army into shape with a short speech. And now you follow in their footsteps. You are good at giving “pep talks” to your allies, and when you do, your allies are more effective in battle than they would normally be."
57,200,Impossible Weapons,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Talent,"It looks like they have you cornered and unarmed. Fools. They just aren’t creative enough to use everything you got. You can use almost anything as a weapon, from a 2x4 to a potted plant to a clay idol. Never again will you be defenseless."
58,200, Inheritor,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Talent,"Sometimes, you gotta prepare the next generation for what's to come. You are skilled in the act of finding a good heir for your powers, and additionally, you are good at grooming people to your specifications."
59,200,Animalistic Incorporation,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Talent,"As a delinquent you are less bound to the hard and
fast rules of traditional martial arts styles. Using animals you have observed as an inspiration,
you are able to incorporate their naturalistic movements into your style. While you will not have
the strength of the animals observed, your motions will be more efficient through mimicking
them, and new techniques may be derived from their actions (i.e. incorporating the movement of
cats would make a martial art more acrobatic, while incorporating the movements of a mantis
would add sudden precise strikes to it repertoire)."
60,200,"Come Back After You’ve Eaten",Baki The Grappler,Talent,"Turnabout is fair play, and that is where you excel. Turning a power dynamic around is
effortless for you. You could have someone piss on you to show dominance, only to make
them aware of how pathetic they are for stooping that low. If you have the skill to back it
up, you could convince a group of men with automatic weapons that they are now your
hostage. In both cases they’ll find it immensely difficult to write it off as a bluff. "
61,200,You’re a Bullet,Baki The Grappler,Talent,"When someone decides to move, there is a 0.5 second gap of unconsciousness before
their body can follow through. You have a knack for spotting that window and reacting
fast enough to let lose at least one good hit in. Even monstrously strong opponents will
be unable to perceive your attack, let alone defend, within that window. However, this is
mainly useful for sneak attacks, and is significantly less
effective on those who know to expect it."
62,200,"No Wonder Nobody Respects You",Baki The Grappler,Talent,"Make no mistake, your bark is just as bad as your bite. You always know just what to say
to tear open someone’s major insecurities. If they’re weak willed, they’ll either likely deny
or fully submit to your claims, but if your opponent’s will is strong, it’ll have the opposite
effect, pushing them to work harder than before and reach for new heights. "
63,200,"Bare-Handed Soldiers",Baki The Grappler,Talent,"One champion and army does not make. You can create hellish training regimensto sculpt
trainees into superhuman soldiers that have nothing to fear from firearms. You can make
them masters of martial arts, infiltration, guerrilla tactics, etc. with inhuman physical
abilities, but you can’t teach anything you aren’t capable of yourself. –"
64,200,"Now That You're Out of Urine",Baki The Grappler,Talent,"When others see an unarmed man, you see a walking arsenal. You can turn just about
anything into a deadly weapon. Whether it’s your hands and feet, a nearby officer’s
baton, your belt, your hair, a paper pinwheel, even your own urine. If it’s within reach,
you’ve already thought of at least a dozen ways to cripple or kill with it. –"
65,200,Excellent!,Tekken,Talent,"There are situations were brain triumphs over brawn. You’re a certified Genius, on
the level of Lee Chaolan and Bosconovitch. You could invent powerful robots without much issue and
have a charisma that allows you to gain the trust of people."
66,200,Restraint Training,Street Fighter,Talent," Handcuffs, arm binding, actively holding back during life or death combat
just for amusement or self-improvement. It's rare, but there are those in this world that do not fight
at their full strength on purpose.
 Upon purchase of this perk, you will actually find benefit in this practice. Restricting yourself
physically either during combat or training will allow you to more quickly improve yourself, cutting
down training time by increasing difficulty. The more you hold back or restrain yourself, the better
training will be."
67,200,Specialized Cooking,Toriko,Talent,"You can now choose a specific form of cooking or even a specific type of cooking to become talented in making. You can only ever choose one specialization to be really good at but it doesn't stop you from learning other kinds of cooking. Options range from the standards like Fried Foods and Desserts to the not so standard like Deep Sea, Poison, and Space Cuisine – a method of cooking that specializes in the preparation of alien ingredients from space.
Specialists will always have a vague sense of how to best prepare their specified form of cooking. Want to fry brandy? You could do it. Want to bake ice? You got an idea. Can be bought up to two times.
"
68,200,Gourmet Surgeon,Toriko,Talent,"Prepping for cooking and prepping for surgery aren't all that dissimilar to you. You stand amongst some of the greatest surgeons in the Human World. Your abilities with a scalpel are second to none. It isn't out of the question for you to be able to perform brain surgery with nothing but a fork, a pair of chop-sticks, and a napkin with a decent chance at success.
"
69,200,It Won’t Work Twice! ,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Talent,"A talent that the Saints share together is how
adaptable they are in battle - often leading to the boast ‘the same technique will not work twice’!
It’s not always true, but some of this talent has followed you in your training - after you see a
type of attack or technique of note, you can immediately process how it worked and how
effective it is against you. In addition, when you formulate a counter-attack of your own against
this technique, you have an instinctive awareness of how effective this would be...though it
won’t give you specifics. Will you take that chance?"
70,200,Altar’s Guidance,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Talent,"To better oneself is a perfectly valid goal, but yours lies in the accomplishment of others. You are a great mentor figure and teacher, always able to bring someone closer to their unexplored potential and to give them a lesson they might need. Hope isn’t in victory, but in the tales those victors and survivors will tell so that their mistakes never happen again.
"
71,200,Evolutive,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Talent,"Now that is special. You can, through a complex and blurry process, permanently evolve or attune your Cloth to other supernatural energies from other jumps. These energies will be amplified if channeled while wearing your armor, like it does for Cosmo, but will also now require a minimum mastery and intensity to be boosted. 
A new energy starts with a grade equivalent to Bronze, with said process also able to upgrade the grade of your armor, with all the implied consequences. Grades are separate for each energy type you attuned to, and the process affects only one energy at a time. It is lengthy, will need rarer and rarer materials, and has a chance to fail and consume material for nothing, but the armor itself is fiat to never be damaged in that case. The successful transformations and upgrades are permanent.
"
72,200,Anti Deception,Saint Seiya Omega,Talent,"At the outset of your journey, a significant portion of the Saints have been
swayed to align themselves with Mars, lured by convincing falsehoods painting
Athena as weak and the Martians as allies in the protection of humanity.
Fortunately, you possess the invaluable ability to see through both lies and
half-truths, allowing you to discern the deceptive nature of these claims.
Furthermore, armed with a keen sense of logic, you meticulously dissect the
inconsistencies and illogicalities present in the narrative, presenting compelling
arguments to your allies to expose the deception and sway them from serving
Mars."
73,200,Temptation of Evil,Saint Seiya Omega,Talent,"With the acquisition of a silver tongue akin to that of Medea, the wife of Mars, you
now possess unparalleled guile and persuasion skills. Harnessing the power of
your words, you can effectively sway and recruit any Saint or individual from an
enemy faction to join your cause. By delving into the depths of their hearts, you
tap into their innermost desires and manipulate their desires to align with your
own agenda.
With compelling promises and artful manipulation, you convince them that
switching sides will lead to the fulfillment of their deepest desires, whether those
promises hold true or not."
74,200,Blind Shortcut,Saint Seiya Episode G,Talent,"Maybe not the most immediately intuitive of ways to train but depriving yourself of one or more of your senses seems to be quite effective. You're able to seal off one or more of your five main senses at will, preventing them from working at all until released, and in exchange you are able to speed up the overall growth of your power. Each sense sealed is a fair boost to the growth speed but they will not make a world of difference, being around a fifth of your normal growth speed as a boost to each sealed sense. You are able to unseal any of your sealed senses with a few seconds of concentration for each one."
75,200,Combat Prodigy,Feng Shen Ji,Talent,"You have become proficient in the ways of battle both armed and unarmed, enough to take down the average combatant with little trouble. You can compress your field of combat to gain expert levels of skill (needing a group of average combatants to be a challenge); unarmed combat goes into either striking or grappling techniques while armed combat goes into melee or ranged combat. You can further compress your expertise to attain mastery in one aspect of your chosen field of combat (becoming a one-man army of your field): striking would let you choose punching, kicking, pressure points, and other striking methods (including elbows, kness, or head strikes); grappling lets you choose throws, jointlocks/submissions, and pinning techniques; for the melee and ranged weapon you would choose a singular type of weapon to excel at, from swords to guns. You also gain relevant knowledge towards whatever field you choose (training, techniques, and maintenance), as well as a propensity for learning additional skills in your chosen field. You may purchase this perk multiple times, and if chosen as the discounted perk all purchases are at discount."
76,200,Knowledge of the Past,Fist Of The North Star,Talent,"You can remember the world as it once was, peaceful and
prosperous, and you have knowledge that can be used to begin restoring it to that state. Maybe you
know how to farm and can pass on methods that will ensure even the scarce seeds villagers have can
become bountiful fields in time, or you have architectural and engineering knowledge that will allow
men to make more than ramshackle huts and slap-dash walls from their scavenged resources. Perhaps
instead you possess insight into law and justice, manufacturing, or some other set of skills that can
improve this world. With each purchase of this perk pick one broad set of skills and knowledge that
could be directly used to help rebuild society for you to know and be able to teach to others."
77,200,Tracking,Fist Of The North Star,Talent,"With nothing but old rumors and vague guesses you can somehow track a man
across the wastelands years after his trail grows cold, whether you are just that good or fortune is on
your side is unknown, but with results like this who cares?"
78,200,Hey Beautiful,Fist Of The North Star,Talent,"You are a true master of disguise. Forget using makeup or a mask, hell you
don't even need to change your clothes. With just a pink sheet you could flawlessly fool desperate
bandits into thinking you are a stunningly beautiful women, even if they are inches away looking you
in the eyes as long as you put on a falsetto you'll have them tricked even if you are a 6 foot tall bodybuilder of a man. With just a pretense of a disguise you can completely mask your features and make
others believe you are exactly what you are pretending to be."
79,200,Deciphering Languages,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Talent,"It is nearly impossible to do
research on inscription patterns without a grasp on the languages
most of the ancient texts are written in.
Even the most fundamental works, such as the Books of Divine
Fire Lightning, are written in lost languages. However, you have a
talent for deciphering dead languages, given time to study you
can learn pretty much any written language you come across."
80,200,Ain’t that a Pretty Technique,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Talent,"Despite what Ji Ning would have you think, not everyone can simply learn techniques of Dao’s
that they don’t even specialize in. You however, aren’t everyone. Even if you only dabbled in
fire Cycles ago, you’d still be able to comprehend and use a Hegemon’s Fire arts as if it was for
your main art. Doesn’t mean you can learn everything though, if you don’t have the

prerequisites, you can’t learn it."
81,200,An Instrument for Murder: Painter’s Brush,Avesta of Black and White,Talent,"Much like the Man-Murdering Demons, you also have found a tool that seems to fit your ideal for murdering. It may be an actual weapon, or just a regular item. It may have some special properties, such as a blade that it’s capable to freely bend and move as you command it, or a saw that actually cuts through distances, but what’s matters more is how well attuned you are to this item: you are capable of channeling any and all of your abilities to an increasing efficiency whenever you are using this weapon, and the weapon will survive whatever you use through it. You may import any item that you own on this option."
82,200,I Love Your Style: Sincere Admirer,Avesta of Black and White,Talent,"Appreciation for an opponent’s power and talent, regardless of their side, is a common trait among the warriors of the Evil side. And what better way to show your respect for an enemy’s style than through pure imitation? You have a natural talent for analyzing and dissecting the techniques of your enemies after crossing blades just for a few minutes, before being able to start to reproduce them on your own. It may not be a perfect reproduction, but when it comes just to pure combat styles, and disregarding actual supernatural abilities, you are able to take them apart and assimilate them into your own style as easy as you walk."
83,200,A Well Preserved Sword: Body of the Kings,Avesta of Black and White,Talent,"For someone as busy as you, it may seem impossible to maintain your martial skill when you are left behind, buried under the paperwork. Yet, you find that your abilities refuse to degrade over time, and whenever you grab a weapon, the experience accumulated over years rushes into you as if you were still in the midst of a campaign. Regardless of how long it has been since you trained or saw real combat, your battle prowess and skills never seem to rust."
84,200,Noble Retinue,Campione,Talent,"Even within the ranks of the knights, you have special talents that separate you from the common ones. More specifically, a talent for finding talented individuals predisposed to becoming friends, rivals, or retainers with little effort, easily extending your sphere of influence and supporters. This also works towards other affairs, like finding good ways to make money and decent skill at managing what amounts to a modern-day fief, even if the world has moved on from feudalism. You could even lead your own Order eventually."
85,200,Self Surgery,Bleach,Talent,"All these wonderful inventions, fantastical improvements to the spiritual form. Yet to trust your
incompetent assistants with the surgeries? The fools without a tenth your skill? No, you have to do
some things yourself. You learned to be self sufficient, even when it was your own body on the
operating table. Self surgery and otherwise operating on yourself is no more difficult than
performing procedures on others. You might need a few extra tools but your skills will be as sharp as
ever and the pain easy to ignore in the face of your curiosity. As long as you have some sort of
manipulator left, even a single limb or some strange tentacle appendage, you’ll work quickly and
surely to put yourself back together. "
86,200,Maze-like Mind,Bleach,Talent,"The labyrinthine Seireitei, the dense jungle of death in Hueco Mundo, even the identical white
corridors of the Silbern. People get lost all the time, especially if not for those with your skills. You’re
a natural explorer, guide and delver into mazes. A quick and easy understanding of how maps and
locations are laid out, letting you build mental pathways to quickly seek through most confusing
locations. Even a difficult maze poses little challenge and you can easily turn this on any pursuer, quickly losing your own hunters or trackers. You know all sorts of ways to lose a tail, from simple ducks and dodges into tiny passageways to Reiryoku based techniques to confuse sensors or disguise the tracks you laid. All the better to circle around and set up an ambush of your own."
87,200,Humanities GREATEST Loser,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Talent,"Take note of the emphasises word in this Perk. Even you are not invincible, especially in this world. However through lose and error and failure we rise to newest heights. With this perk, any lose you suffer will only make you greater. You might learn to dodge better or a new technique but an improvement will always be there should you fail at something and it will always make you greater than before."
88,200,Dark Teacher,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Talent,"Teachers have a great deal of power, given they are the source of each proceeding generation’s greatest warriors, magicians and leaders. Rarely is this more true than it is for you. A teacher like few others, those who study under you find that they learn as if they had enormous talent for anything you teach them, picking up everything from the combat arts to the spells of the far off Norse with lightning speed. Even faster this grows should you welcome them into your bedchambers and give them the gift of your thighs. You are particularly charming to any student you have in that manner indeed, and find that even those not yet your student will feel a growing desire to become such as your own fame for great skill and power grows. "
89,200,Always Learning,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Talent,"The immortal life is one of long years and a constant struggle for meaning as everything around you
has begun to fade. You are somewhat familiar with this, as you age at just a fifth the rate other
humans do and have already lived for many years. Of course, unlike many immortal beings, you
found a great spring of motivation within you. You have apparently endless patience and focus, no
matter how boring the task at hand is, and that is coupled with a terrific propensity for learning new
information, as if you were still a child-like blank slate to stamp new knowledge onto. If anything, the more you know, the easier you find it to learn new things, as you apply the lessons, principles
and data from past subjects to anything even remotely similar to what you have learned before. The
final aspect to your lifelong task of endless improvement is that you find you do not technically need
a teacher, even for things that normally need such a thing, so long as you work at your task many
times longer than normal. Even the strangest of magic can be figured out eventually, given you have
centuries of isolation to do so."
90,200,Man of the New World,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Talent,"As the world moves on from hitting each other with crude sticks and fists, power begins to change
hands. The strongest man in the room goes from an undoubted leader to mere muscle for the true
power, the man with all the knowledge. A combination of natural prodigy and years of effort gave
you a position among Britain’s most vaunted minds. While your most famous talents are focused in a
single academic discipline, such as Moriarty and his world renowned skill with mathematics or an
unsurpassed brilliance with biology, you are broadly skilled with many other fields. From several
respected academic paths to the different styles of the arts and even a deep understanding of
philosophy, you match the learning in each of what most men try a decade or more to come close to. Though a touch barbaric, you even indulged in learning a martial style of the empire, having enough
experience in boxing or baritsu to knock back-alley heads together without trouble.

It’s made possible with a particular mental technique that allows you to easily absorb and retain
information, the creation of a continually expanding ‘memory palace’ style territory within your
mind. Information is easily memorised and efficiently stored, granting the ability to rapidly make
connections between even seemingly disparate pieces of data that you have gathered. Knowledge of
disciplines you once studied thirty years ago remains as fresh as the new fad you spent an afternoon
exploring."
91,200,Kei Healer,Chrome Shelled Regios,Talent,"You have mastered Kei techniques that can heal and cure individuals of what ails them from wounds and bruises all the way to poisons and diseases. You have incredible talent in learning or creating techniques related to healing.
"
92,200,King of Hybridization,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"Nie Hansan is a Netherworld creature who was captured by Bu Fang so that he could till the Heaven and Earth Farmland. Unexpectedly after he got bored Nie Hansan started to experiment with all of the plants and animals within the farmland. Doing so allowed him to discover that he was actually immensely talented at creating hybrids with enhanced flavors and completely new ingredients. You have a similar talent whenever you are creating hybrids you are able to maximize their effectiveness and create new traits. As a benefit while this ability is primarily meant for cooking you may freely apply it to anything involving combinations or hybrids. This perk can even affect your children. For example if you had a child with someone from a different species they would inherit all of the qualities from both species at their greatest potential. 
"
93,200,"
Money Making Expert
",Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"Due to the system's demand for crystals, Bu Fang constantly has to acquire more money to increase his cultivation. As a result he has proven himself a shrewd businessman and is extremely capable of earning money. You share this talent, when it comes to crafting schemes and business strategies you are unmatched. Under your care a minor restaurant could become a focal point of a city and earn a fortune. This perk extends to any form of business that you do in order to earn a profit. The effect is mainly geared towards money, but can increase all forms of profit.
"
94,200,Power of Law,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"The power of law is something that must be comprehended in order for an individual to become a god. As gods get stronger they must comprehend more and more laws. This option allows you to gain an affinity for a particular law allowing you to develop it at rapid speeds. For 200 CP you may choose any standard or high ranking law. This includes the law of Light, Devouring, Gravity, Fire, and many others. If you pay 300 CP however, then you may choose one of the five Supreme Laws. These laws are the laws of Space, Time, Destruction, Life, and Transmigration. Supposedly there are other supreme laws, but knowledge of them outside of the 3,000 laws has been lost. For reference Bu Fang and the Crown Prince were considered unrivaled geniuses after they both had comprehended two of these laws. You may purchase this multiple times in order to acquire different laws. "
95,200,Imposing Manner,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,An imposing manner is known for many different things. One of the most common is sword qi. This is an imposition cultivated by mimicking their sword's sharpness. This option allows for you to choose one such imposition and increases your talent when it comes to developing these attributes. Where previously you required years of intense training you may only need a few months now. 
96,200,"Cut 10,000 Radishes",Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"Being able to work with knives is an important skill that every chef must possess. In fact it can be considered the most fundamental skill possessed by chefs. This perk grants you immense skills with knives and other short blades. This skill can be used for feats such as carving, cutting, and cooking in general. Even if you relied on this alone you could easily craft beautiful dishes and enhance their flavor. This effect will also boost your skills in combat regarding bladed weapons. If you pick up a sword or a knife you could make the blade dance and those around you would be in admiration of your skill."
97,200,Good Dad,Beware Of Chicken,Talent,"A concern that has plagued humanity since its dawn is thus, will I be a
good parent? Such concerns are unfounded for you, as you are naturally
good at raising kids into healthy well adjusted adults. You do need to
actually try and be there for them, but once there you’ll find everything you
need to do to impart good habits and morals coming naturally. They don’t
even need to be biologically your kids, or even young, you can be a good
parent to just about anyone."
98,200,Paper Pusher,Beware Of Chicken,Talent,"Bureaucracy, a problem that has plagued every era since tribes began to
form and will never end. And in the lands of Xianada, the paperwork one
has to deal with can match the vastness of the land itself. This is an issue
for many administrators, the ones who honestly do their work anyway, but
not you. Your talent when it comes to matters documentation are godly,
even managing the most impressive city in an entire province would still
leave you with so much free time that the jobless might question where you
find the hours in the day."
99,200,"Unabashed, Unmatched Sex Fiend",Against The Gods,Talent,"You’re one. Really, you are. When it comes to wooing
others, you have the kind of skills that the very best casanovas in the world would come together to
declare you the One True Sex Fiend.
You know just how to talk the right way, how to behave in the short and long term, how to touch
them just right, so as to inflame the passions of even the most frigid, hard-to-crack people in the
world. You can make them fall in love with you or in bed with you, or both. And yes, you have the
skills and endurance to thoroughly satisfy any number of people you may have brought to your bed.
Furthermore, you also have the skills to ensure that your existing partners have no problem with
you fucking, or marrying or entering into relationships with any number of other partners. Indeed,
your partners tend to grow close by themselves, even getting romantically involved if their
personalities fit right. This works on any member of your preferred sex you set your mind at, be
they people, spirits, gods or anything in between."
100,200,You Won’t Escape,Dragon Ball,Talent,"Towa and Mira actually aren’t that dangerous power wise, they however, are nearly
unmatched when it comes to escaping. You however, have extensively studied these
types of foes developing tracking skills, sealing arts, and other useful techniques to deal
with these opponents. These primarily manifest in three ways. The first of which is that
you have an innate sense of locating your targets. This effect can bypass any form of
concealment or trickery. The second is the ability to lock space and time within an area.
This makes any attempt at fleeing impossible, the only way for your foe to escape is for
them to kill you. Lastly, you have learned how to best trick your foes into exposing
themselves. After all, you need to bring your foe into the open before you can properly
kill them."
101,200,Accumulating Potential,Dragon Ball,Talent,"Goku’s rise to power was rather strange in the grand scheme of things. For years his
power remained pathetically below before erupting to a level few in the universe could
match. Like Goku, whenever your growth slows down or you willingly seal your growth it
will start to accumulate. It will grow overtime until you either acquire some sort of
catalyst or willingly unseal yourself. This will cause your power to rise at an
astronomical rate. For example, Goku had a slow growth rate for nearly 12 years and
his power grew 3000 times over."
102,200,Skin Like Steel,Dragon Ball,Talent,"The primary method for mortals to grow stronger is generally by refining their bodies.
This allows them to increase their total ki and withstand the effects of more powerful
techniques. For example, most transformations like Super Saiyan put an immense
amount of strain on the body. Luckily for you, you have a massive amount of talent
when it comes to refining your body. It is naturally significantly stronger and more
durable than your peers. Additionally, the rate at which your body can adapt and
improve is astronomically faster. If someone lacks a piercing attack or is significantly
stronger they may not even be able to harm you."
103,200,True Chef,Dragon Ball,Talent,"A proper chef is far more than someone who can cook a dish well. Being a true chef
requires you to be able to identify ingredients, prepare all sorts of meals, and craft
exquisite dishes. Deciding to pursue this either for pleasure or a job you have been

trained as a master chef. Your training covered virtually every form of cooking known
throughout the universe. You can also identify any plant and animal figuring out how to
best prepare them for a meal. Lastly, your dishes are truly legendary capable of
perfectly satisfying even the most judgemental of eaters like Beerus and Whis."
104,200,The Sonic Warrior,Dragon Ball,Talent,"Dypso is considered to be one of if not the fastest mortal in existence. You however, are
someone worthy of challenging him for this title. You are significantly faster than other
beings at your level. Additionally, you are now capable of reaching light speed and
potentially even faster depending on your strength. Even if you’re not the fastest being
alive yet, you have the potential to reach that title. Lastly, you can utilize a power up
state similar to Dypso’s Light Speed and Maximum Light Speed modes to further
enhance your speed. These states can drain your energy, but they multiply your speed
multiple times over."
105,200,Latent Talent,Dragon Ball,Talent,"While hard work can allow one to surpass their limits, talent can still help. For example,
if similar individuals train the same amount the highly one would greatly surpass their
partner. Luckily for you, you’ve been blessed with an immense amount of talent. You will
find that you will learn and grow at rate dozens of times faster than others. This perk will
affect any form of learning or training you undertake. Just remember you still need time
to actually develop your skills."
106,200,You’re Doing It Wrong,Dragon Ball,Talent,"You have an innate understanding of how to best train yourself
and others. For example, if there is a special method to train a power you possess, you
will naturally figure it out in a short period of time. This also makes you an excellent
teacher as you can streamline your allies training methods."
107,200,Wisdom of a King,Dragon Ball,Talent,"While it may not be his most well known skill, King Vegeta was a surprisingly skilled
King. He was able to manage both the Saiyan race and a large number of planets in the
surrounding area. Like the late king you have been trained in how to manage a
kingdom. This includes how to manage expenses, delegate tasks to capable
subordinates, and dealing with all of the responsibilities associated with running a
kingdom. Second, you have to either train or recruit capable subordinates. Thankfully,
you seem to naturally attract these experts from all fields. As long as you build up your
kingdom safely it is practically guaranteed to become a powerful territory in the future."
108,200,Plants and Vegetation,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Talent,"You have a boundless talent for alchemy, the making, invention, refinement and improvement
of pills, potions, elixirs and all related things. Not only do you have an innate, encyclopedic
knowledge of any and all herbs and materials out there, you have an instinctive grasp for the
right way to prepare useful items out of them.

It would be a rare recipe that you couldn’t perfectly make at first try, and most times you can
come up with off-the-cuff improvements that trump what most ‘top’ alchemists could do after
decades of study.
Finally, you’re also immune to all poisons and venoms out there, all the better to ply your trade."
109,200,Ultimate Vexation,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Talent,"That’s a pretty good name for you, yes. Maybe not quite as much as Lord Third, but you have a
talent at, in essence, pissing people of. You only have to look at someone and you can tell what
will make them raging, spitting mad, and how to do it most effectively.
Even without really focusing on it, it’s something you can just instinctively do to individuals or
groups, so much so that an afternoon with you would have the kindest, most wholesome people
trying to strangle you and each other with their bare hands.
You can even apply this talent to break down the will of anyone you can get to listen to you for
long enough without being able to escape or retaliate."
110,200,Jade Fist,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Talent,"In a world all about personal power, there’s a surprising amount of utility to be had from
connections and contacts. Especially by someone like you. You’re a genius of what’s called
Social Combat, able to manipulate, pressure and dominate others through avenues few in this
setting are equipped to handle, the social scene.
Even if someone is several cultivation levels higher than you, you have a peerless talent for
leveraging the power of whatever sect or clan or elders you have behind you to break and beat
them, wielding your backing as a club to beat down others every bit as effectively as others
would use their own personal power.

You rapidly develop an intimate grasp of the social situation of any place or group you wander
into, and grasp the points through which to exert pressure, who can be relied upon to give up
their ‘face’ and who will try and protect it even to their detriment... everything you need to
establish a dominant position,
Of course, keep in mind that in a world like this one, all this goes only so far. All it takes is
pissing off someone sufficiently powerful and all social manipulations come to sudden and
violent ends."
111,200,Mediator,A Will Eternal,Talent,"The world of cultivation is one filled with traps and pitfalls, and not just the physical kind. It is
all too easy to accidentally disrespect some pampered young master, or offend a sect for a
small conflict with one of their members. Hence the ability to talk down the sides of a conflict
can of great use. You are quite talented at this in fact, at stopping conflict and bringing sides
together. Being an important figure for each side of the conflict will do wonders to help too."
112,200,Wonder Forging Genius,Generic Exalted,Talent,"Your crafting abilities need to be seen to be believed. From
your hands pour forth miracles given form, works of art of peerless and breathtaking
magnificence, works of culinary delight that would leave Emperors sullen at the thought that no
other foods could compare, weapons that could last hundreds of years of constant use that
would leave men feeling honored to have been slain by them, all these and more take shape
under the guidance of your hands. You would be welcomed in any land and by any court for the
sheer quality of your work, and you will quickly gain national, if not worldwide, fame for your
creations if you bother to advertise them at all.
The least of your creations are superior to anything a mortal master might create, and even the
simplest and least adorned of your works will be possessed of unmatched efficiency, resilience,
and simple elegance. Purchased with the Savant perk this is taken to an even grander height,
leaving even the crafts of other Exalted looking as pale and shameful imitations by comparison,
assuming you put forth the same effort they did in learning your base crafting abilities."
113,200,Eight-Fold Geomantic Mastery,Generic Exalted,Talent,"You possess the inherent understanding and skill with
geomancy and the manipulation of natural energies such that you may now create manses in
any area where such a thing could conceivably be created. The stronger the mystic or magical
significance of a given place the more powerful the manse that can be built there, but even in
the barest and most mystically barren areas you will still be capable of producing, given some
time, a manse of the least (1-dot) power. The process of creating a Manse is tremendously
faster for you than it would be for others, the necessary geomantic arrays and arrangements
seeming to simply leap to your mind with a clarity of insight few if any could match.
The Eight-Fold part of it is that you understand the methods for creating manses aspected
towards all five of the elemental essences of fire, earth, wind, water, and wood as well as
manses aspected towards solar, lunar, and stellar (sidereal) energies. Given time and effort you
may discern methods for creating other types of manse, twisted mockeries of what nature
intended, but such insights will take considerable effort, time, and resources to bear fruit. Taking
this perk explicitly allows you to create manses even outside of Creation and, indeed, is the only
way to create manses outside of Creation."
114,200,Logic,Solars Exalted,Talent,"A treasured but surprisingly rare ability in all of Creation is the ability to overcome
falsehoods and the words of honey-tongued tyrants through simply pointing out their flaws. After
all, anyone with the ability to do so usually comes with the inherent assumption they’re already
correct or is a peasant who meets the wrong end of a daiklave in retribution for it. But you have
the ability to examine a situation objectively and point out obvious or subtle lies or misdirection,
along with being able to dismantle cultural assumptions through simply pointing out that they’re
wrong. Some may react violently, but only the most delusional or determined can refute you -
and those who were strung along by charisma or Charms will quickly realize what has been
hidden from them. You may be considered the bane of the Immaculate Philosophy and the
scheming of certain Chosen if you use this carefully enough."
115,200,Flawless Form Technique,Solars Exalted,Talent,"The Solar Exaltation which beats in the heart of each and
every Dawn caste is one of the most powerful military tools ever to exist. No other exalted can
come close to the raw mastery of combat that these individuals can effortlessly obtain. Even the
creators of the universe were in the end destroyed, defeated by those who had been blessed
with the truest potential of the fight. However any of the solars can swing a sword, any of their
number possess the potential to excel at combat. What the Dawns possess, and so shall you, is
an enlightenment on the nature of war. An epiphany that guides them to master all forms of
martial skill, not just a speciality in a sword or bow. They understand that all combat is one, and
their understanding of one discipline can help to guide the others. A master swordsman can use
their knowledge of effective cutting strokes to guide the perfect angle on a loosed arrow, or the
understanding of a dagger mid-flight can inform the movements of entire armies. And the
deeper your understanding of combat, the greater you can expect to see other areas of war
bolstered by."
116,200,Perfected Calligraphy,Infernals Exalted,Talent,"Elloge is a writer and storyteller without peer, ever creating within herself new vortices of
vocalization and tangles of text. Her inner worlds reflecting manifold different tales and
countless chapters of her own narratives. The deepest parts of her have little to do with
reality as it is or ever was, idealized paradises and grand dramas unfolding in realms that
resemble Creation, Malfeas, lost Zen-Mu, or any number of other, fictional worlds.
So too may you craft elaborate narratives and uniquely beautiful stories, ever writing with the
zeal of inspiration, and muse-born linguistics that would stand out even in the countless

annals and libraries of Hell. From now on, you shall live and breathe the ingenuity of a
talecrafter without peer. Appropriately to the wondrous correspondences you shall write, you
will also gain the calligraphic skill to write with neat flowing script or ornate glyphs in all the
numberless languages of the Sphere of Speech."
117,200,The Funereal Order of Righteous Morticians and Embalmers,Abyssals Exalted,Talent,"When the Primordial War began, the town of Sijan already devoted itself to interring and
honoring the dead. Even before the Underworld existed, people wanted to show respect to
the dead, and a funeral gave them a means to do so. The annals of Heaven say that as
each Primordial fell, the Sijanese performed funeral rites specially designed for each
component soul, urging the dead cosmogon to rest in peace. The annals of Heaven do not
describe these rites, however, by express command of the Maiden of Endings. If any records
survive, no one knows except the most senior members of the Morticians’ Order.
Before the Lawgivers of the Old Realm even thought of exploring it, the Morticians’ Order
had already contacted the Underworld and knew how to house and appease the dead. Sijan,
therefore, rather than Stygia, claims the honor of the first city of the Underworld. The East
holds hundreds of tribes and nations, with at least a thousand different ways of celebrating,
venerating or mourning a loved one’s passing, and almost as many for the death of an
enemy. The professional funerists of Sijan serve them all. Sijan’s jet-black funeral galleys ply
the rivers of the Scavenger Lands unmolested by brigand, pirate or robber baron. The silver
bracers of the Morticians’ Order are a common sight in most cities.
Members of the Morticians’ Order spend their entire lives serving the dead and training for
their postmortem careers. But these days, it sometimes occurs that their best and brightest
join the ranks of the Abyssal Exalted instead of their colleagues in the Underworld. As one of
the foremost experts of the Morticians' Order, you have all the knowledge and skill you need

for practically all the funereal rites in Creation, being a master of ceremony and ritual, or
embalming and tomb-design, and many more things besides. Such mastery could even be
used to create new burial rites, so as to appease the dead and ghosts that don't fall under
the existing ceremonies. And of course, you are also a trained exorcist, with the skills to deal
with more troublesome ghosts."
118,200,Weaver of Cerements and Despair,Abyssals Exalted,Talent,"When the Children of Dust are not busy leading their circles or managing the day-to-day
operations of the Deathlords’ empires, they frequently become poisoned ambassadors to the
living and the dead. As agents in Creation, these Deceivers draw towns, tribes, nations and
empires into chaos, allowing the other members of their circle to work unmolested. When the
living can be convinced, coerced or tricked into serving the needs of the dead, the Winds of

the Abyss make all the necessary arrangements. In the Underworld, the deathknights of the
Moonshadow Caste serve many of the same purposes. They broker agreements between
warring ghost factions or kingdoms, all in the name of unifying the dead beneath the
Deathlords. With them also lies the responsibility of resolving conflicts between Deathlords,
even if all they actually do is observe the formalities and carry out the rituals of tradition while
the Deathlords negotiate their grievances in person.
Having become an expert diplomat, you can now fulfill this role too. Whether speaking to the
living or the dead, you know how to broker agreements, how to convince people, and how to
trick them into going along with your wishes. You could spark wars with just only a seemingly
innocent conversation at the court of the ghostly king, or broker peace between two warring
nations by acting as a intermediary between them."
119,300,Put On A Show Darling - Boosted,UQ Holder,Talent,"Years and years of performing have really shown their results now. You’re superhumanly good at every kind of performing art there is. Ordinary people, even those with little interest in art, can be brought to tears with your paintings. Your music can inspire people to rise up against murderous oppressors. Your writings can, and more than likely have, influenced the course of entire countries when you’ve gotten them published and read. And those special effects? You’re able to summon up entire ghostly parades and festivals when you want to properly announce yourself. They can’t do much other than look and sound impressive, but no one’s going to miss your presence.
"
120,300,Rider of the Endless Path,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Talent,"You are a master at riding. When you need it, you may summon a mount of your choice (it is either a horse or something that you own, like a hell motorcycle), and upon it, you are an expert at taking down others. You will almost never crash, and it is hard to hit you. Not to mention the fact of how satisfying it is to hit someone with a mace while riding a motorcycle. Your mount also grows more durable, at least half as durable as you.
"
121,300,Monster’s Instinct,One Punch Man,Talent,"Garou’s greatest strength lies in his ability to learn and adapt during battle. Like him, you possess an uncanny ability to rapidly improve in the midst of combat. The more you fight a particular opponent or encounter a specific fighting style, the faster you can predict their moves and develop countermeasures. Your instincts become sharper with each passing second, allowing you to turn an enemy’s strength into a weakness. Each time you fight, you grow more powerful, more skilled, and more dangerous, making you a nightmare for any opponent who dares to face you more than once."
122,300,Guiding Instinct,"A Cultivator's Beginning",Talent,"You are able to figure out what is best in the way of training. Given the choice of ten different teachers, you would be able to figure out which of them is the best for you, or for another, with minimal information about each teacher.

You also would be able to figure out how to use any technique no matter how poor your instruction, provided you are able to learn it to begin with."
123,300,Crystallization of Strength,Baki The Grappler,Talent,"Martial arts can’t make you strong, just teach you to make
the most of what you have. You have the observational
ability to quickly grasp different martial artstyles, picking up
on their strengths, weaknesses, and gradually merge the
best aspects of each into your own style. Do note this just
helps you learn the motions, and you won’t be able to
perform learned styles anywhere near as well as those who
spent their whole lives specializing in that style specifically. – "
124,300,Law Comprehension,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Talent,"Choose an element, you now
have comprehended a fragment of the Law - or CODE, in other
translations - respective to that element, as a bonus, you also
take no damage from that specific element anymore, unless you
want to. You have an unmatched talent in that specific Law.
Time-Space counts as just one element.
Each person may only become the Spiritual God of one Law, but
Laws bought with this perk do not count towards this limit.
You can teach your understanding to other people, and they are
guaranteed to have the minimum amount of talent to understand
and be able to use it, even if in an insignificant way"
125,300,Reaching the Heavens,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Talent,"As a child you bore witness to the power of heaven. Since than you wanted to reach these same heights. With this Perk such a goal might be easier to achieve. It will serve you as both a Training Booster and a path maker, giving you the same capacity for greatness other humans of this World like Lu Bu showed. Any attempt at Training will always leave you with some improvement appropriate for the training you underwent. If you for years spend your days swinging one weapon... it might just cleave the sky."
126,300,Artisan of the Supreme Holy Heavens,Against The Gods,Talent,"While a huge part of everything, cultivation is not
all there is to life. There are things to enjoy too, such as arts and beauty. This perk gives you
exemplary, extreme talent for arts of all kind. Anything you do, you can do unbelievably beautifully
and artistically.
And those words really do mean just that. A casual scribble from your fingers would have people
paying absurd sums in auctions for it, singing a couple notes could inflame a whole new musical
movement worldwide, and something you put actual effort into could drive people into rapturous
adoration simply by encountering it. This works in every field of art, from writing to drawing to
singing and dancing, and you can even train it to further improve things."
127,300,Limit Break Survivor,Dragon Ball,Talent,"Many species have natural limits imposed on them. There however, are some
exceptional individuals who can not only shatter these limits, but do so repeatedly. You
are one of the rare individuals capable of this. Any so-called limit or restriction you
possess can be ignored with enough effort. This means that you will never stop
increasing in strength no matter how far you go. Though as you climb higher you will
likely need to put more effort into breaking your new ceiling."
128,300,Treasure Designer,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Talent,"There are a lot of treasures in this world, and the sheer variety of amazing things they do is
mind-boggling. Except to you, I suppose. You are a real, proper artifice genius now, with this
perk.
From Weapons to Protective and Movement Talismans to Formations, you have an instinctive
grasp of the art of craftsmanship, creating impossibly powerful effects with even the simplest
devices. You can reverse-engineer any and all magical items or fields you see, no matter how
complicated, and understand how to copy the effects and methods used to make it. You can
combine principles from multiple devices, or even embed cultivation insights into them to make
better ones."
129,400,Anti-Monster Tactics,UQ Holder,Talent,"Well-versed in the supernatural foes that exist in this world, you’ve become able to figure out and then create weapons to strike at the specific weaknesses of monsters. So long as you have an example of a monster, such as a corpse of one of the species, and time to study it, you are able to produce weapons or items that are much more effective than normal against that specific being. Guns that rapidly fire holy stakes against vampires, weapons that spray silver gas against werewolves, even esoteric magical knives to greatly harm certain kinds of immortals. The stronger the target being, the more time it will take to make your solution."
130,400,Training From Hell ,UQ Holder,Talent,"Blood, sweat, and tears. The cornerstone for all hard work training. It’s just a shame that not everything can be solved by putting your head to that grindstone and beating it till it bleeds. You managed to break that invisible boundary and get the chance to make yourself miserable to solve all your issues. You’ve become able to train anything about yourself. By repeatedly using and abusing some part, power, or aspect of your being, you can slowly start to make it better overall. Want your regeneration speed to work faster? Subject yourself to horrific injuries over and over and over again for a few months and watch yourself regenerate in just a fraction of the time it normally takes you. Want to have more magical energy? Empty out your reserves over and over for a couple weeks and see how many sizes that inner lake grows. So long as you can use it, you can grow it."
131,400,Scorpion School Technique,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Talent,"No place is safe, so long as you were there. You know how to bait people, create traps, and plant those traps where they would be the most useful. You can also make traps at an unusual speed, capable of trapping an enemy base despite the fact you just got there."
132,400,Martial Arts Prodigy,One Punch Man,Talent,"Garou is known for his unparalleled ability to learn and master any martial art in record time, and now, so are you. Your mind is a vast reservoir of fighting knowledge, allowing you to analyze and replicate martial techniques simply by observing them. You can take bits and pieces from various styles, seamlessly blending them together into your own unique and devastating approach. In combat, you are a tactical genius, able to exploit weaknesses in even the most seasoned fighter’s techniques, and within minutes, you can develop strategies to counter any opponent. There is no technique you cannot master, no fighting style you cannot surpass."
133,400,"Peerless Genius
","A Cultivator's Beginning",Talent,"Your combat strength is far, far more important than your cultivation speed.

You have the ability and talent to use your cultivation realm, combat skills, and techniques beyond their original capabilities without overdrawing or receiving significant damage to yourself.

This allows you to become invincible to those of the same level, be capable of fighting and winning against those that have a half-realm above you, and become equal to those that are one realm higher.

As a bonus this also greatly increases your cunning, wits and combat awareness in battle, allowing you to outmaneuver and use the environment to the fullest to emerge victorious even fighting a group a half-realm higher than you."
134,400,"Teach Me, Master","A Cultivator's Beginning",Talent,"You have the uncanny ability to have anyone you meet teach you the knowledge and skills that they possess without any great difficulty or time spent on your part.

Skills that took them hundreds of years to develop and master could be learned in mere months, while skills that took only decades to master could be learned in days.

Of course, all of this is entirely dependent on finding the master in the first place."
135,400,Patience of a Saint,"A Cultivator's Beginning",Talent,"A cultivator has enormous amounts of patience when they cultivate. Sitting for years or decades in a cultivation stance would be no problem to them, but it will test the will and determination of any normal man.

Now with this you are able to sit and cultivate without moving for centuries with no problem, while spending countless years on a single task, or just living a normal life after spending years in a bloody battle, would no longer be a problem for you anymore."
136,400,"Master and Disciples
","A Cultivator's Beginning",Talent,"You are able to teach any learnable skill you possess, so long as they can be learned and taught rather than innate.

Your students advance in their learning by leaps and bounds in their studies under your personal tutelage, acquiring in months what would take others years to obtain. By the time they have completed their training, they will be just as competent as you are in these skills and will never forget what you have imparted.

Your students have an innate sense of loyalty to you and won’t betray you for their own gains."
137,400,"Swiftly Advancing
","A Cultivator's Beginning",Talent,"You are inherently skilled with cultivation. Your training is ten times more effective than before, which by itself would probably put you on the edge of being a “Young Genius”. However, this boost actually doubles when you are learning things for yourself, rather than learning from a mentor, and removes all penalties which you might otherwise experience from the lack of instruction.

Any result of your breakthroughs will always have the highest results and you will never experience any bottlenecks that would prevent you from advancing. As a bonus this also prevents you from ever failing in advancing your cultivation systems, no matter the reason."
138,400,"A Lover’s Loyalty",Baki The Grappler,Talent,"Strength, technique, savagery, speed, whatever you’re just hurting yourself with all this
flirting. The fewer of these areas you devote yourself to, the greater your might and
growth in that area will grow proportionately. Singling out one area of combat at the
expense of everything else, will see exponential increases in that area."
139,400,Wood Warrior,Tekken,Talent,"Mokujin is an entity famous for one thing in particular… copying the abilities of
other fighters. You can replicate any move set you have seen, necessary things like swords or wings
for those will be available to you in spawned wood like form. This ability has its limits however as you
can only copy one power set or fighting style at a time. This also only includes the STYLE not the
actual POWER. For example you might be able to possess powers and moves of a Devil but will
nowhere be near the Strength of someone possessing the Devil Gene. That part is up to you to gain."
140,400,World Tournament,Street Fighter,Talent,"There has to be a mountain for there to be a peak. A champion cannot be
champion of nothing, have no feats, glory or accomplishments to their name. With this perk in your
grasp, now you can provide that stage for someone to be named ""Champion"".
 Upon purchase, you acquire the inexplicable skill with setting up big tournaments. Getting
endorsements from governments and businesses to pay for various expenses. Booking a suitable
avenue for it to take place. Generating PR so word spreads about your competition. Finding and
inviting worthy competitors. Even getting a lofty prize together to make it all a bit more exciting.
 It doesn't have to be about fighting, the subject of the tournament can be just about anything you
can think of as long as it can be competitive. You can set it up at city level, the national level, and
with time and practice with the skill even the creation of international tournaments with the best of
the best from all around the world becomes possible."
141,400,Monkey See,Street Fighter,Talent,"Often you may have the ambition to learn, but no one and nowhere to learn
from. You want to train and become a better fighter, but exercise can only take you so far. So what's
a martial artist hopeful to do in such a situation? Adapt.
 This perk helps with learning and adapting the martial arts techniques you see others perform for
personal use. This is possible with only a fraction of the knowledge of how it is performed available,
like only being taught part of it or watching it performed repeatedly.
 That being said, the less information you have to work with, the more differences found between
your variant of the technique and move's true form. It might not necessarily be inferior, in fact it
should be quite functional and comfortable given you reverse engineered it for personal use, but it
will often be different."
142,400,Ingredient Revival,Toriko,Talent,"Decades of cloning research and training are now yours to use. You have knowledge on a wide variety of techniques, technologies and miraculous plants, animals and materials that can be used in the revival or cloning of ingredients. This can be used for the temporary revival of dead things or with enough time and the right resources you can bring extinct ingredients back to life be they plant or animal.
With enough practice and the right equipment, it's not impossible to start creating new life or even combine various plants and animals into new species."
143,400,The Same Technique Will Not Work Twice!,Saint Seiya Omega,Talent,"In contrast to the current generation of Saints who may lack proficiency in this
innate ability, you possess a unique gift that sets you apart. With the ability to
analyze techniques upon witnessing them at least once , you gain an innate
understanding of their flaws and vulnerabilities, allowing you to craft perfect
counters that render them ineffective against you. This unparalleled skill extends
beyond mortal adversaries to encompass even gods, ensuring that no opponent,
regardless of their divine stature, can overcome your strategic prowess."
144,400,Nurturing The King,Saint Seiya Omega,Talent,"Understanding the pivotal role of mentoring and training in shaping the future,
you prioritize the development of individuals whom you deem crucial for
upcoming endeavors, much like Eden, destined to be the new king of Mars.
While the typical process of training and mentoring can be time-consuming, you
possess a remarkable gift for accelerating the growth of your students.
Under your guidance, individuals progress rapidly, achieving combat readiness
akin to that of Silver Saints within just a month—a feat that would typically require
years of training. Moreover, your expertise extends beyond combat skills, as your
students absorb other subjects with remarkable speed and efficiency. This
ensures that they are well-equipped to handle any situation that their future
position may entail, laying a solid foundation for their success and contributing to
the realization of their potential."
145,400,Martial Making,Saint Seiya Episode G,Talent,"No technique is perfect when first created. Like any art form, it can always be improved with time and experience. Coming back years later to your old techniques, the flaws and ways to improve it become obvious, especially now that you have the means. You are able to reforge techniques to become far stronger and even get rid of innate weaknesses or flaws by constantly using them in life or death battles. Even when they should not become that much stronger, such as becoming better without you putting in more energy, or when the flaws should not be things that you can train off, such as a sacrificial attack needing you to sacrifice your own life, you can work through the suffering and pain to reforge them into something much more powerful."
146,400,Crafty Monkeys,Feng Shen Ji,Talent,"No limits to one's imagination. If you can think of it you can do it!  You are a quick learner, comparable to Ah Gou himself. You now train 10 times faster than normal and you have no barriers on your capacity to learn, process info, and develop one’s physicality, intelligence, skills, powers, perks, etc...  Ah Gou  was able to learn and master advanced metallurgy techniques, never encountered before in a mere couple of months; all the while learning close quarters combat to match the average God even as a human.

147,400,Lord Marshal,Feng Shen Ji,Talent,"You have become the ideal leader with one set of skills, depending on your chosen ruling policy. Being able to handle economics & logistics very well, with finance and trade being your bread and butter you could easily double the level of wealth for your domain within a month. Having a level head for judicial processes and policies, able devise order from an active mob with your silver tongue and settle civil matters. Or become a vibrant-figure that any kind of army would die to get a hold of; having a skill for tactics to run a war twice over as well as the skills to both train and lead a newly formed militia into hardened warriors within a month or (in reverse) reintroduce these same warriors back into civilian life. "
148,400,One in 20 Octillion,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Talent,"It is a fact that everyone in the wider Chaosverse who has reached a certain level of power is a
genius. There’s no two ways about it, yet somehow, despite coming from the equivalent of rural
Africa, you’re still considered a genius amongst the beasts of the Chaosverse. Whatever level of
Genius you hold, you’ll soon find will never become obsolete in the face of scaling strength and
new worlds. If you were a minor genius of Formations in the Three Realms, you’ll still be a
minor genius of Formations in the Chaosverse rather than a complete buffoon."
149,400,Original Mystic: Primitive Power,Avesta of Black and White,Talent,"Appreciation for an opponent’s power and talent, regardless of their side, is a common trait among the warriors of the Evil side. And what better way to show your respect for an enemy’s style than through pure imitation? You have a natural talent for analyzing and dissecting the techniques of your enemies after crossing blades just for a few minutes, before being able to start to reproduce them on your own. It may not be a perfect reproduction, but when it comes just to pure combat styles, and disregarding actual supernatural abilities, you are able to take them apart and assimilate them into your own style as easy as you walk."
150,400,Heretic Yazata: Glitching Technique,Avesta of Black and White,Talent,"Sometimes, in order to shorten the gap between those powerful Daeva, one needs to get a little unconventional. And you are a master when it comes to creating and performing unexpected, and usually extremely dangerous, combinations of powers and items. Some may call you a madman, but no one may deny the results you bring. You can forcibly mix two or more abilities that were not meant to work together, creating a new technique with devastating results.

Some examples of these are the techniques developed by the Jet-Black Warrior, Magsarion: Using several blessings of defense, which increases your weight, and teleportation, which basically makes it,so you move through distance in no time, to turn yourself into a human-shaped cannonball that can destroy a mountain. Forcibly transmitting an excessive regeneration via combining several blessings of regeneration and offense, so your enemy’s regeneration gets overwhelmed, and they begin to collapse. And many other combinations that you will be able to come up with in no time using your own unique abilities.

While these techniques may be seen as suicidal by most, you also have a knack for finding ways to ignore the more lethal or even debilitating damage from them, albeit you may not be able to always escape unscratched, and this is usually limited for yourself."
151,400,Potion Maker,Trinity Wonder ,Talent,"Different worlds have different plants and creatures. Different ingredients means different potions. It could end up being impossible to replicate even the most basic potions in a different world simply because the most common, integral ingredient does not exist. Luckily you have a rather special ability, shared by the likes of Pink Papa. You can use pure ki or mana in order to supplement ingredients in elixir making. The stronger and more complex the elixir, the more energy and harder it is for you to substitute in ingredients. A simple potion may not take much effort to recreate. A moderate one like Youthful Virtue may take a reasonable degree of control over your ki, and a good deal of power. Of course, this would be useless without the basic knowledge on how to make elixirs. Knowledge you now have. You could make quite a comfortable living just by selling your services as a potion maker."
152,400,Princess Power,Bleach,Talent,"Not being a fighter doesn’t mean you don’t matter. With all this focus on power and technique and
race, people forget about the hearts that lie under it all. Power doesn’t come from nowhere and it’s
all too easy to falter when times are tough, without someone holding you up. Even though it can
sometimes cause heartache, you’ve always been naturally in tune with the emotions and drives of
other people. Understanding and empathising with others is just a part of life, something that
extends from you to other people if you extend a hand in peace. It’s all the more difficult to hurt you
when they can sense you genuinely want to find a better way and all the easier to actually find that
better path together. Even a supposedly emotionless monster might not be able to resist the slow awakening of hope
inside. With enough time, your earnest desire to forge a bond with others can save even the most
wretched demon. Give redemption to those who didn’t even understand it existed. "
153,400,This is My New Bankai,Bleach,Talent,"So many powers, so many forms. It’s rather common to find yourself suddenly using a new kind of blade mid-battle or to have taken on some monstrous new shape. There’s no better way to grow than conflict. The challenge just comes from not screwing up with these new powers you’re unfamiliar with. But if they’re all coming from your soul and potential, would it be that odd if you were already capable? Immediate adaption and adjustment to new abilities just happens for you. The sudden release of your Shikai is wielded with competent, though not masterful, hands despite it likely being a weapon you’ve never used before. A new spell just figured out is useful in combat, rather than needing hours more to learn the right timing. Even abilities copied from others are not unfamiliar. With a few moments to get a feel of things, you’re able to adapt with instinctual knowledge to use things relating to combat at a competent level. If these things happen to build on what you’ve already learned well, like a Bankai to your mastered Shikai or a new spell in the repertoire of a Kido Master, you’ll see this instinctual skill greatly increase. You still won’t know everything but you’ll be able to fight as an expert or even a master despite only just attaining this new level."
154,400,Combat Science,Bleach,Talent,"There’s a place for science outside of a lab, for those quick enough to put it to proper use. You’re
able to easily apply your knowledge and mental skills in combat to stunning effect, depending on
what exact scientific disciplines you focused on. Whatever you know, you’re able to figure out how
things work in relation to that and how to use that information to destroy. A Reiatsu specialist could analyse spiritual techniques mid combat, being able to dispel them with
their bare hands and own energy once they understand the technique. A doctor could do similar to
enemy bodies, finding the most vulnerable points and turning normal cuts into crippling injuries. A
psychologist could turn this to hostile mind’s, predicting every move an opponent makes after a
short period of study. Your knowledge becomes a weapon to wield. "
155,400,Bringer of Life,Bleach,Talent,"The doctors of the Fourth Division can save even someone with truly horrendous injuries, if they get there in time. But you? As long as they had a pulse a few seconds earlier, you can bring them to fighting fitness. From Kirinji’s training, as Unohana’s apprentice or your own self study, you’ve reached a similar level of medical mastery. Your mixture of mundane medicine and comprehensive knowledge of healing Kido allows for you to effortlessly restore even the most mangled of forms. Both raw damage and a stunning variety of ill effects can be removed with your attention, as well as easily organising the transfer of Reiryoku to reinforce tired warriors. Your techniques will often rely on your personal Reiryoku to sustain, though you still possess inhuman skill with ordinary medicine to complement and make up for the absence of power. If you had quite the amount of power yourself, it wouldn’t be impossible to restore someone to healthyfitness immediately after you melted every scrap of flesh from their bones, over and over again. So long as it’s short of actual death, or at least swiftly after death, you might as well be able to heal anyone you can get your hands on."
156,400,Swordmaster,Jujutsu Kaisen,Talent,"During the Culling Games, many powerful individuals from centuries past were incarnated in the modern age, hijacking the bodies of those who’d unwittingly consumed their Cursed Objects. Yet, among all of the talented ancient sorcerers, there was one outlier: Hagane Daido, a non-sorcerer unable to even see curses. Despite lacking the capacity to use jujutsu, however, Daido more than made up for this with his by being a true master of the blade.

Choose any form of weapon you like: the sword is the most natural choice, but it could be spears, axes, bows, or even something stranger besides. Whatever your choice, you possess incredible prowess with it, enough to stand at the peak of what is possible. Even if you lacked the ability to manipulate cursed energy, you’d be able to fight on equal terms with a pretty powerful jujutsu sorcerer or a cursed spirit capable of moving at Mach speed, your sheer skill letting you overcome their superior physical abilities and esoteric techniques. It’s to the point that just holding your weapon of choice causes you to exude an aura of pure lethality, a testament to your mastery sure to strike terror into the hearts of your foes.

Alternatively, you may forsake specialising in a single weapon type to gain a more general talent. No matter what it is or what form it takes, so long as it’s a weapon of some sort, as soon as you pick it up you’ll not only know how to use it, but use it well. You won’t be close to the same level as the option above, but you make up for this with the sheer versatility this talent gives you, allowing you to wield anything at the level of a well-trained combatant. There’s nothing saying you can’t improve your skills further, either."
157,400,Spartan Bred,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Talent,"Sparta breeds them strong, they do. Those bronzed bodies, built like they were cast by the gods in
the greatest refineries. By natural birth or a similar upbringing, you’ve got a body and the physical
potential to match the legendary Spartans. You can make cities quake with a stomp and sprint across
the country in a few minutes, enough to match even moderately powerful demigods and
phantasmal beasts. You don’t yet have the comprehensive and intense training of the Spartans
themselves but in their place, you find you have incredible potential for learning new combat or war
related skills and improving those skills at a massive rate. Even if you started as a child, you’d quickly
surpass men with decades of experience after a few months of learning. However, while your
starting potential is great and will only grow, you only show your true power when at a disadvantage. The worse off you are in battle, the more you’ll find your powers, raw statistics and skills improve for
both you and close allies you have nearby. Facing some notably stronger than yourself might see a decent boost to your own strength but taking just three hundred of your best friends to block the
passage of one of the largest and most powerful nation’s greatest army, vastly outnumbering and
overpowering yourselves? They’ll be talking about the feats you accomplish two thousand years on
from that day."
158,400,Wisdom of the Haunting Ground,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Talent,"These long, long centuries have not been idly spent by you. You devoted yourself in your life until
now to mastering all that you could get your hands on. And master you did, for you possess
seemingly supernatural ability in hundreds, if not thousands of different skills and fields of
knowledge. So long as the skill or knowledge existed before the first or second century AD, you have
already learned it to the point that you can pull off supernatural feats with it. Your skills with horse
riding, for example, are such that horses are driven to move at speeds far greater than physically
possible and become able to ride up walls as if they were flat land. You could create poultices from
plants that heal with magical efficiency. However, while your wisdom is vast, it is limited in the fields
of combat or magic. Perhaps you neglected those areas of study in your long life, for you have no
more skill in things relating to those fields than any other person. "
159,400,Angel of the Battlefield,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Talent,"Just being a leading star in the medical field isn’t enough to change the world, not when you have to
do it from the front of a battlefield too. While you are most certainly at the front of the pack in
terms of medical skill and knowledge of your time, at least as far as Nightingale’s time, your talents
are more notable than that. A superb instinct for all things relating to medicine, it allows you to
easily master techniques and technology even centuries advanced from your time if you can gain
access. Even without access, advancing medical knowledge comes smoothly and quickly to you, accelerating the speed of new discoveries greatly.

Medicine becomes widely applicable in your hands, in some ways superhumanly so. Your knowledge
makes you a lethal combatant even with limited combat training, innately understanding the most
efficient ways to move your own body, the most vulnerable vital points to strike and how to greatly
reduce damage with the right block. Your treatments become applicable on all targets, even against
what seems like common sense, as you can stitch up the wounds of spiritual beings with no more
difficulty than a flesh and blood human. Even non-humans take only a small time to study before you
can effectively understand and begin treatment. While this talent does not directly boost the power
of healing magecraft, your knowledge and the skill it lets you use those spells with make you a far
superior wielder to most."
160,400,Kei Teacher,Chrome Shelled Regios,Talent,"You can awaken the Kei Vein in others, by infusing someone with Kei they will start the process to grow the organ that produces Kei. After someone has their Kei Vein awakened you can teach them any perk with Kei in its name that you have taken, except for this perk. In order to help you speed up the process you are better at teaching pupils anything related to Kei that you know. 
This can also be used for any similar energy."
161,400,Kei Talent,Chrome Shelled Regios,Talent,"Until you Lintence said only Layfon was this talented. Like Layfon you can grasp techniques just from observing them, and utilize them with Kei or other energies you possess. You do not only copy these techniques, you also understand them and can even find ways to improve upon them. You can copy and understand any martial art, technique, ability, spell, power, etc that you have the capability to use. Like Layfon and Lintence you do not lose capability and understanding of how to use these techniques no matter how long it's been since you last used them. This talent also grants you unlimited potential in all things you do. This understanding of copying techniques applies to all aspects of combat: martial arts, strategy, & tactics being just some of the examples. "
162,400,Spiritual Refinement,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"One of the hardest parts about working with higher level dishes is retaining the energy they possess. You are capable of not only retaining the energy, but enhancing it. Any meals you make are capable of functioning as high level elixirs that can allow cultivators to level up. This also is important when creating medicine to deal with various injuries.

"
163,400,Cultivating Hobby,Beware Of Chicken,Talent,"It might not be apparent at first, especially to those who blindly follow the
Cultivation traditions of others, but one’s Dao is inherent to the way they
live their life. This naturally works both ways. Pick some mundane activity, it
now is a Cultivation Method you have high compatibility with. This could be
carpentry, photography, dancing, just about anything you can think of that a
mortal would do."
164,400,Bouncing Back,Beware Of Chicken,Talent,"A simple truth is thus, you can always learn from your experiences and
grow as a person. You have integrated this truth, and as a result are
capable of pursuing your own growth in just about any situation. No matter
if it means turning your back on what you were taught all your life you will
be able to make the leap to become your best self. This also helps with
recovering your power should you ever be weakened."
165,400,The Gang,Beware Of Chicken,Talent,"Getting people to work together is one thing. Making and managing a
gang? That’s another. But you can manage that just fine. You are good at
gathering together and managing your own gang of misfits. You’ll even find
those with potential flocking to you as well. Diamonds in the rough and all
that."
166,400,Organization Setup,Beware Of Chicken,Talent,"One man, no matter how talented, can only do so much. That is why tribes
were formed, why cities were organized, and why governments came to be.
Not all groups are created equal though, it takes a deft hand to craft a truly
efficient entity. A hand like yours. As if you were born reciting the teachings
of the honored founders of the Cloudy Sword Sect you can make your own
groups like the Plum Blossom Shadow that earnestly and competently
accomplish the goals you set and operate independently along the paths
you desire."
167,400,The Legendary God-forging Craftsman,Against The Gods,Talent,"There are a lot of things in this world that go
beyond martial cultivation and powering up. Sound Transmission Talismans, Profound Arks, armors
and weapons, medicinal pills and teleportation formations, and so much more. And you can shake
the world in all these fields.
You are now an absolute, unbelievable genius at all such ‘support’ fields. An enchanter, smith,
alchemist and formation designer without peer, your mind miles ahead of even the greatest of your

would-be competitors, and ideas flow like water. You only need to look at any item, pill, weapon or
formation, to know it to the innermost depths, every trick involved in making it, every flaw and
potential for improvement, and how to bring them to reality.
In future worlds too, your skills translate perfectly, granting you knowledge and skills in the local
variations of these things equal to what you leave the previous world with."
168,400,Clever Fiendish Devil’s Bullshit Spinning,Against The Gods,Talent,"You’re good at lying, Jumper. Not just good, but
it’s more like you are an artist of the lie. You know just what emotions to fake and how to say things
that will convince others of your professed sincerity, and can spin almost endless bullshit while
knowing just how to keep it believable.
Also, and perhaps more importantly, this perks also makes it so any supernatural effects aimed to
detect your thoughts, emotions or morality will fail, and return generic harmless results."
169,400,Supreme Saint of Medicine,Against The Gods,Talent,"You are a peerless expert without equal, when it comes to
the arts of healing. Not only can you tell everything wrong with a person with a single glance at
them, you also possess an unerring instinct that guides you as to the best possible treatment for
said ailment.
For this world, your medical knowledge and skills completely equal the great Medical Saint Yun Gu,
unquestionably the best healer on the planet. Just like him, you know long lost techniques to both
heal and improve the body, and have an immense knowledge of peripheral skills like refining herbs
and animal parts. While you don’t start on quite the same level in future jumps, you’re very close,
and can catch up rapidly.
Also, you have a vast, encompassing knowledge of acupuncture and related techniques, such as
opening profound entrances and all others. This gives you the Heavenly God’s Spiritual Veins for
free, and you can obviously grant them to anyone you want, at will. Can’t take it back, though."
170,400,Is it possible to learn this power? Not from the protagonist.,World Seed,Talent,"With the upcoming changes in the world, or even just by playing Neolife, you’re undoubtedly
going to come into the possession of many new skills and abilities. But is it really the strength of
his powers that defines a man? No, it is how he uses said powers. Well, using them better is
mainly to get even more powerful, but you get the gist. And with this perk you get it even more.
Using your abilities to their fullest potential is child’s play to you, and you can easily use several
abilities you have in tandem to amplify their strength beyond what might be expected of them.
What’s more, you also have a talent at coming up with entirely new techniques and and ways to
use any powers you have for most any situation you can think of. If you have the Fire affinity,
you won’t even need to think for a second before realizing that you can also use it to pull fire
mana out of an object to freeze it, and having to shoot your enemies with twenty variations of
elemental beams will be a thing of the past. You also possess the mental faculties to actually
question how your powers work, and if you ever used shadow magic, you would surely
recognize that it could only work if a seperate shadow realm existed. So rest assured, as with
these gifts you’ll never need a divine intervention to actually use the vast power you have
gained."
171,400,Shake Those Butts!,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Talent,"So places like this are usually about individual power, one man reaching beyond the masses.
Well, this lets you subvert that. You are terribly good at making bizarre techniques that can be
used by large groups of people, with a greater number of people translating to the techniques
being more powerful.

The moves might be weird, the accompanying phrases might be silly and embarrassing, but
these are immensely, undeniably effective techniques all the same. And if enough people
participate, they could bring down beings that would normally be able to effortlessly mow
them down like a scythe through a field of grass."
172,400,Power of Comprehension,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Talent,"Comprehension matters a lot when it comes to learning and mastering skills, and it would be
hard to find powers of comprehension better than yours. Your mind works on levels entirely
unimaginable to most people, now. Not only can you replicate just about any technique you
come across just after seeing it once, you truly understand all the things you see, down to the
purpose and meaning of every little component of it.
So good is your understanding of such things that you can find ways to use techniques, both
actual attacks and tiny, seemingly irrelevant things like the specific ways one shapes a fireball,
to create effects that should really be quite beyond them. Simply by layering small incremental
boosts, or by combining two trash techniques, you can come up with moves that wouldn’t be
out of place in the hands of a true genius beyond geniuses.
Nor is your talent limited to modifying or better using existing techniques. You have a penchant
for inventing new ones, refining and combining your insights into new techniques and
methods as good as, if not better than anything found in ancient jade slips. You don’t start out
being able to redesign cultivation for everyone, but if there was ever anyone who could, it
would be you, since your talent for comprehension and creation is just that great.

Finally, you also have an immense capacity for enlightenment, wherever it’s needed of you. It
comes both in the actual mystical and spiritual form, and in the form of a constantly working
mind that allows you to better combine systems, magics and techniques to make them all better."
173,400,Imparting the Dao,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Talent,"The Dao is an intensely personal thing, and beyond some advice and help, there’s only so much
any teacher can do. Unless they’re someone like you, that is.
You’re not just a great teacher, you’re an amazing one. Once someone acknowledges you as
their teacher, they find things coming to them so fast as to be unbelievable. The comprehension
abilities of your students rapidly grow to absurd heights, improving more the more you
interact with them.
One word of advice from you could clear away millennia old bottlenecks and grant insights
into the Dao people half a dozen cultivation levels above you would cherish, while more
personal attention sees results proportionately greater.
Indeed, it seems as if under your tutelage there is no such thing as a lack of talent, as even the
worst, least capable students of yours explode into beacons of talent to match the finest
seedlings any storied sects or clans have. While they don’t gain any unique heritage or
bloodline, constitutions change and foundations deepen, and by the time you’re done with them
any of your students could be regarded as a once-in-a-lifetime talent, a diamond of the first
water."
174,400,Misdirection,A Will Eternal,Talent,"You have something of a talent for misleading others. For acting and telling half-truths or lies
to get people around to your side. Consequently you are great at convincing people to do
what you wish. You could infiltrate an enemy sect with relative ease and no-one would
question a thing, as long as you have a semi competent disguise. You might even be able to
talk someone who you had just kidnapped and smacked around into letting you be their
trusted subordinate, because you totally were doing it all for their own good."
175,400,Masterful Intrigue Method,Generic Exalted,Talent,"You're a master manipulator on a level even most of the
Exalted can barely comprehend. Your plans are labyrinthine in complexity and subtlety, able to
wind your way through the political mire that is Dynastic court politics to a level few if any can
match. You can be as open or as hidden with this as you wish, and your plans and intrigues are
so intricate that short of telling people what they are most will never suspect you at all, and even
if you did tell them then that too may be part of your plans. If the Scarlet Empress was still
around, and realized you had this level of political acumen, she would either promote you to a
lofty position where she could keep an eye on you or have you executed outright. It's a good
thing she'd probably never discover you though, even if she were still around.
This perk strictly applies to intrigue, politics, and social interactions however if purchased with
the Drop-In perk 'Savvy Snake Method' it will also apply to plans and designs you make in
regards to the field of military strategy and economics."
176,400,Assumed Membership Stance,Generic Exalted,Talent,"You're really good at getting into places. Supernaturally
good in fact. Whether you're walking right in through the front door and claiming you're actually
a member of the court or stealthily sneaking in through the midden you'll find that you have little
issue getting into, and out of, just about anywhere. You're so good at this in fact that you can
even convince people you're supposed to be where you are even if the place you're at has a
known membership and they know you're not one of them, whether because you're that good at
persuasion or something else is at work is unknown. What is known is that you'll have no issue
traveling about and infiltrating all stations of society. Foreign Prince? Of course you are. 7th
member of a 6 man secret organization? No doubt them not remembering your membership
was all some sort of prior plan they're just now recalling.
This won't give you any particular protection once you're inside if you're too obvious about the
fact you shouldn't be somewhere, but as long as you can play along people will just kind of
assume you're supposed to be there"
177,400,Fire-Forged Comrades Method,Solars Exalted,Talent,"While a single Solar stands as a point of light against the
encroaching darkness that seeks to swallow Creation, a general is nothing without an army.
However, the glory days of the First Age are long gone and the former Lords of Creation are
hunted as demonic Anathema, and thus no retinue may be easily available to them. But even
this can be overcome. You may train effective armies from the ground up in a staggeringly short
amount of time, turning a village into an elite fighting force within a week or two, tops. How
effective this is depends on how far you spread your efforts...training a single individual will
quickly see them become your equal (though obviously without Charms or any other
advantages, unless they already have those or you grant them somehow) in combat and
strategy, training a small village will create a disciplined squad that will put the veterans of
Lookshy to shame, and training an entire country would create a crude but functional army.
Obviously, this can be improved further if you have more time to raise these troops. This can
also be applied in training or delegating any sort of organization or group of people - letting you
raise ‘troops’ for art galleries or dancing as easily as you could battlefields. In addition to this
increase in discipline and competence, they will develop or strengthen a sense of loyalty
towards you - those newly blooded generals will lay their lives down for you, and that village will
be all to ready to fight for you."
178,400,Seven-Finger Jumper,Solars Exalted,Talent,"Once, there was (or never was) a Solar who had snuck past the
Gates of Heaven, past the watchful eyes of Sidereals centuries his senior and stole from the
most sacred Garden within. Then, he left and returned again, disguised as one of those senior
Sidereals, tricking a young Exalt into giving away a powerful artifact he was made to safeguard,
and the theft was not noticed until days later. Most remarkable of all, this Solar had not activated
a single Charm - they used their own wits, cunning, and tenacity to fool those he had spoken to,
and vanish without a trace. This tale has been woven into your own abilities - your prowess in
spying, espionage, theft, larceny, and trickery is second-to-none. You can trick the hearts of
men, Exalts, and even beings vastly beyond yourself, and steal from under the noses of all but
the most paranoid and powerful of foes. All with a laugh on your lips and the wind on your feet."
179,400,Brass Dancer,Infernals Exalted,Talent,"Music and dance are intertwined, the two arts inseparable, as well-played music makes
listeners want to move in time with the melody, and the rhythm of dancing feet makes its
own music. In Malfeas every kind of demon has a special dance to express their very nature,
and now so do you. You could dance a specific dance that expresses yourself in impossible
clarity, and even when dancing in other ways or taking someone else's lead, you move with
supernal grace. Your movements and poise executed with elegance unmatched by any, but
the greatest in the Demon Realm. With exceeding care and practice, you might dance with
Malfeas Jouten and perform his weapon dances together as his equal... for a time at least.
Even the efficacious dances of demonkind come easy to you if you see them performed, so
that you may slay onlookers with the Gilmyne's Dance of Extinguishment or crack the earth
and cause earthquakes with Stanewald's thirteen dances."
180,400,Enlightened Discourse,Infernals Exalted,Talent,"It is said that Qaf has neither base nor summit. His dimensions are not defined not by space
and distance, but by discovery and understanding. In ascending Qaf’s slopes, a barefoot
monk can easily outpace the swiftest flying engine, if he is wise. In his numberless stations,
timeless scenes are reenacted and lessons are learned, even if these lessons are
antithetical to mortal souls. So too, have you gained the calm wisdom of an enlightened
master, calmly speaking to others as you teach and enlighten them with but a few
well-placed words. Your wise teachings are such that a bloodthirsty warrior might forsake
battle and cast aside his blade, to instead simply sit and hear your lessons of wisdom and
spirituality."
181,400,Unhallowed Messiahs Raven-Black,Abyssals Exalted,Talent,"As the holy spiritualists of the Abyss, the Scions of Resplendent Darkness are expected to
spread their dark brand of piety in Creation as well as in the Underworld. They teach mortals
the proper respect for and veneration of the dead, and help the living to accept the simple
fact that they too must die someday. Once the living finally come to accept that, they’ll
realize that there’s no point putting off until tomorrow what could just as well come today.
While any of them in Creation could have death cults grow like tumors around them, you
have a particular talent for converting people and awakening fanatic devotion. In your wake,
cults of death or people's ancestors pop up with disturbing regularity, merely through a few
words germinating into an unholy ideal or an example set and followed by the living. With
your surpassingly eloquent speeches and preaching, even the most devout might come to
doubt their faith in the face of your dark theology. Needless to say, you will find it easy to
provide your circle with spies, assassins, essence, and a haven in the living lands."
182,400,Prodigies Breathe Their Last Breath Young,Abyssals Exalted,Talent,"In life, Eye and Seven Despairs was a prodigy who died before his time. In death, he is just
as much of a prodigy, yet also feckless and capricious. He is the youngest of the deathlords,
despite being one of the first to accept the Neverborn’s bargain. He lacked the centuries of
experience and power his peers have over him. Yet now and then, he produces startling
innovations in necromancy and necrosurgery, usually following the lead of some other
Deathlord and then leaping ahead to make discoveries of his own. He may, indeed, be the
most intelligent of the Deathlords... when he puts his mind to something. Achievements such
as his Cold House and the zombifying disease known as Embrace of Decay stand as
testaments to how much this Deathlord could do if he truly wished.
And in this, you shall take after him. Though you will hopefully maintain a less fickle mindset,
you shall find yourself leaping ahead of your peers and coming up with innovations that may
disquiet the Deathlords themselves. Already they see signs that the Abyssals can grow in
power more quickly than they ever thought possible, and your insights and work will stand as
a testament to that."
183,400,Extermination Writ Large,Abyssals Exalted,Talent,"When the First and Forsaken Lion first revealed his power, by conquering Stygia in the
aftermath of the Contagion, his rival Deathlords moved against him, revealing their power to
the Underworld at large. Yet, the other Deathlords found that the army occupying Stygia
dwarfed all their forces combined. His army, the Legion Sanguinary, is the largest military
force in the Underworld, if not in all existence. The Legion is several times larger than the
army of the Mask of Winters, the only other Deathlord who could seriously challenge the
Lion in direct military combat, and even Juggernaut might be no match for its sheer scale.
So too will you find that bending your talents to projects of mind-boggling scale is something
you do easily and naturally, quickly allowing your plans to scale upwards and letting you
crush your opponents through sheer weight of numbers and scale. You might raise an army

to dwarf all but the Legion Sanguinary in both Creation and the Underworld, construct an
immense fortress to cover an entire mountain range in soulsteel ramparts and hollow-out
caverns in but a scant few years of time, create gigantic war machines the likes of which the
world has not seen since the heights of the First Age, or a manage the affairs of nation so
massive that the living would disbelievingly call it a Direction in itself."
184,400,Inevitable Sovereignty Approach,Abyssals Exalted,Talent,"The Mask of Winters plays a dangerous game, attempting at once to dominate the mortal
realm of Thorns and at the same time play the other Deathlords who might oppose his quick
rise to power off of one another. Employing a combination of courtesy and audacity, the
Mask of Winters wasted no time in establishing himself as a worthy power. Already, he
commands an entire network of spies throughout the Threshold and several other areas,
including the Realm itself. Very little occurs politically in the Threshold without the Mask of
Winters hearing of it, and he has his agents in the courts of many other Deathlords as well.
Like the Mask, you’ve got a firm grasp of politics and espionage. You’d manage to worm
yourself in the political landscape and diplomacy of a regions and force nations to deal with
you as a respected equal, even when you are blatantly an undead overlord bent on conquest
of the living world. And of course recruiting and placing spies all around, even at the heart of
your rivals’ courts, should prove easy enough to a spymaster as skilled as you."
185,400,Grand Mentor,Mushoku Tensei,Talent,"You are an excellent teacher who can teach even the most unwilling and hard headed people and any student
that you teach will always have your lessons be perfectly engraved in their mind, body and soul. They also
comprehend, understand and retain any kind subjects, skills, knowledge, discipline and etc... that you teach
them no matter how complex and mind-blowing it is in the current era. The students that you teach learn and
show results that would normally take even genius people decades to achieve in just months under your tutelage,
though their proficiency and mastery can only reach your level proficiency and mastery on whatever you teach

them. Your students will always acknowledge you as their master and even your most ungrateful pupil would
shed tears on your death."
186,400,Escape Master,Mushoku Tensei,Talent,"Traps and prisons are common things that can kill the powerful, especially if they are not careful. Thus, spotting
traps both magical and not is a breeze for you and additionally you know how to best get around or evade them,
whether by disarming or dodging at the last minute. You’re also a master at escaping making it clear that no
prison, bindings, seal or dimension can prevent you from escaping. This also gives you great attainments at
making traps and would be especially effective if it's designed to target a specific person or race, and the traps
that you make can be both physical and magical."
187,500,Bewildering Brilliance,"A Cultivator's Beginning",Talent,"To succeed in this world, you must be a great genius like no other, even among the luminaries of your generation. With this, you will be.

Your rate of learning new things, techniques, ideas, and even entirely new arts is something almost beyond imagining. You are a genius, the kind of person who can master entire martial styles, or new fields of practice, in days, weeks at the most.

This doesn’t just affect your mind, either. Your body can keep up perfectly with everything your mind learns, growing at an equal pace with every new insight you gain."
188,500,Hidden Potential,Toriko,Talent,"Among people are those who were born to greatness. That small percentile has a much easier time learning, if the topic matches their likes. They also have less trouble with physical cultivation and growth of said strength. Lastly you gain the ability to gauge others potential and instinctively know how to bring it out.
"
189,500,Lion’s Eyes,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Talent,"Observe, understand, apply. That is how humans learn and how they survived so long. You however take the first two to the limit, able to perceive and understand even the strangest phenomenon for what it really is. This gift however truly shines in combat, able to fully understand your opponent’s techniques with but a glance, to better use that knowledge to your advantage. "
190,500,Every Day Miracles,Saint Seiya Episode G,Talent,"All Saints have the potential to accomplish the impossible, Gold Saints most of all. But where the miracles achieved by your peers are things to be marveled at, you find it even easier to do. Not only are you capable of achieving things normally considered impossible to happen, you also find it significantly easier to do those things. When you are taking advantage of your Saintly nature to achieve things that should be impossible, you’ll find those tasks are much easier for you than for anyone else, even if that person also had the ability to do impossible things. These tasks will likely still be extremely difficult but far easier for you to accomplish."
191,600,Eight Hundred Years of Cutting ,UQ Holder,Talent,"After 38 years, this blade cut steel. After 80, no demon or spirit could withstand this edge. After 200, anything in the visible realm split in two. In 500, even invisible matter ceased to be an obstacle. And in 800 years, anything in this world would be cut. Curses, Karma, even Concepts. But this was not possible through talent, not something anyone could achieve just from being a prodigy. It was only through the miracle of hard work beyond hard work that it became real. You have the same propensity for hard work that let Juuzou Shishimi learn to cut all things in the world. As long as you constantly work hard at practicing a skill for long lengths of time, you can push it to far beyond anything normally or in some ways even supernaturally possible. Cutting concepts with mastery of the blade, pinning gravity fields through tremendous skill in grappling, burning time itself with fire magic. The broader the skillset, the longer it will take."
192,600,Give Me One Month,UQ Holder,Talent,"When you put in the work, you get a lot more gains than anyone else in your place would. You don’t learn faster with this, you just grow faster. Attempts to train your body or powers or some other thing that requires you to put in effort over a long period to grow goes far quicker for you, around forty times as fast as normal in fact. You’d do in just a fraction of the time what everyone is expecting you to do. Really helps when you’re under a time limit too."
193,600,Battle Born,UQ Holder,Talent,"You’re gonna be leaving people speechless when they watch you get stronger. You’ve got an inborn talent for combat like few others, enabling you to master all things related to fighting and combat with trivial ease. You’re able to accomplish years of learning in just an hour of practice or outright copy combat techniques just by seeing them once, though you’ll need to practice a bit to really get them down. You’ll be surpassing the masters in no time, so long as you’re aiming to get better than them at fighting. Do note that this does not help you grow, just learn. If you want to get bigger muscles, you’ll need to put in the work to train and grow them."
194,600,Heir to the throne,Cradle V1,Talent,"You are far and beyond the best of your siblings. Whatever they achieve it pales in comparison. Whatever quality your herald parent is searching for, she has found it you. Your ability to progress with your parents’ path is now doubled, and you are always seen as “noble” and “princely” no matter who you are in any jump."
195,600,Experimenter,Cradle V1,Talent,"Much like the sacred artists of the dawn spring archive, your path to power is a bit more... fluid. You can now attempt to bind or copy techniques from wildly disparate paths to create a path never before seen anywhere else. This applies to any other mundane or magical martial art you know. You can also fuse them seamlessly into something that is unmistakably You."
196,600,A Sword Carves Through,Cradle V1,Talent,"Every sacred artist will reach bottle necks, and a slowing of your growth when your young can be a death sentence for your future advancements. Now you will be able to bust through them if you attempt to engage with an internal fight within yourself to kickstart your understanding. This will take about a day max, and if you fail, you may try again after a day. After three failed tries, you must overcome the bottleneck normally."
197,600,Teacher of the Ages,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Talent,"You might be a good master, but a good teacher? With this, you are both. You may teach anything you have learned, regardless how complex it is, in about a year. And those easy-to-master arts? You can teach them even faster."
198,600,Murder the Gods and Topple Their Thrones,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Talent,"The Seven are uncaring about the world they rule. They let the guilds and syndicates rule the world for them. But maybe that isn’t good enough for you? You know how to get a revolution started. You are a master at setting up small cells, providing weapons and supplies to your followers, and everything else a revolution requires. Though, this doesn’t help when it comes to actually recruiting people, just with the followers you have."
199,600,The Master of the Universe,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Talent,"Sometimes, life isn’t fair. Sometimes, you gotta make your own way to what you want. When a power is hidden behind a wall that only those that are born a certain way or were blessed with potential, you can reach it just by searching for enlightenment. Let no one, not even the universe, change your path."
200,600,"Martial Innovator
","A Cultivator's Beginning",Talent,"Normally a cultivator would just follow the footsteps of the predecessors, only learning and mastering existing techniques without any innovation, with only those that reach the high levels of cultivation creating new ones.

But now, you can create new ideas, innovations, variations, and applications from existing techniques, as well merging two or more techniques into one unique technique. This also applies to fusing two or more elements, concepts, etc. into one, with the result possessing all of their advantages and none of their weaknesses or drawbacks.

This also allows you to upgrade or improve existing cultivation techniques as well as re-creating missing and incomplete techniques. With the help of this Perk, making truly heaven-defying techniques or even greater would be a lot easier, and creating cultivation methods appropriate to your cultivation realm are also possible."
201,600,Lion’s Roar,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Talent,"Well, it seems you got the “apply” part covered too. Not only can you absorb all its understanding like a sponge, but anything you witness or understand, you can instantly use yourself or improve too so long as you aren’t inherently incapable of it, and even then can get it to work to a degree. The only genius equal to you when it comes to combat now is young Leo Regulus, the one who used a 3-Saint technique alone better than the original, or combined every move of the 12 Gold Saints’ signature moves in one… at the age of 14.
"
202,600,Watch Them Scream,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Talent,"Rather than an aspirant, you could now confidently say to equal Minos in warfare, even sharing his talent and favorite : psychological warfare.  You have a knack for demoralization tactics, torture, pressing a group’s buttons, all it takes to make them vulnerable or careless… or just for the fun of watching humans suffer if it’s your thing."
203,600,Greatest Under the Heaven,Feng Shen Ji,Talent,"All training/benchmarks now share the same level of difficulty. In RPG terms, 
going from lvl 1 to lvl 2 will be the same as going up from lvl 98 to lvl 99. Your 
growth aptitude is now double, being 20 times now. Also all costs for abilities and 
skills are now halved, and any debuffs/curses that are cast upon you (or that you 
pick up) become positives instead of becoming detriments; doing the reverse 
effect upon you.
"
204,600,Divine Skill ,Feng Shen Ji,Talent,"After many years Gods are able to develop tangent abilities to their Divine Power; and although this is something most Gods can do later in their lives, purchasing this perk makes it so you have achieved this state already. Some examples are having the power over vibrations developing into superspeed for a few seconds, having wind manipulation turn into control of vacuums and air pressure enough to survive in space, or having abilities over a pool of decay turning into producing a swamp with its own pocket dimension of rot. For those without Divine Power, this will work on any of your supernatural abilities if you wish it too, having them develop tangent abilities of their own. Though don’t expect water manipulation to suddenly start manipulating the earth for some reason, that doesn’t make any sense."
205,600,Genius Seen Once In A Bazillion Years,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Talent,"You are
super talented in cultivation. With a glance you will be able to
understand the intricacies of the universe. Cultivation techniques
can be instantly understood, regardless of how complex and
profound they are. On top of this you can also teach others how to
cultivate properly, making it possible to even teach those without
any Soul Realm - they will find that a Soul Realm is budding
inside of them.
The TRUTH of cultivation unravels before you, a genius never
once seen.
Post-Jump, this perk will also cover any other cultivation system."
206,600,The Invincible Swordmaster,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Talent,"Your affinity with
weapons, your body included, has reached heights never seen
before. You can master any kinds of weapons with just a
glance.
Post-Jump you can teach everyone you want how to reach
cultivator levels of physical strength."
207,600,The Bond between Master and Student,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Talent,"The bond
between Master and student is one that is as unseeable and untouchable as the energy of the heart.
As a cultivator, you know that death is around every corner, whether from the tribulations now or a
failed Tribulation later on, and you need a legacy, a legacy more than some words and a
demonstration of your understanding on a cave-wall. No, this legacy is that of a line of disciples
that will spread your name and techniques far and wide as they rise in power, immortalizing your
name eternally in the history of the cosmos. Sadly, many can never pick the correct people. Either
they pick someone who is secretly mind controlling their daughter into becoming their sex-slave,
or they find someone with early explosive growth, but with that early talent fading later on. Not for
you though, you can always tell the full potential of any person you meet, and if given enough time
with them, could find opportunities to guide them to reaching it, or even surpassing it. If you felt
like it, you could turn a mortal late into their life into a celestial immortal in five thousand years
even if they never had a chance of reaching the Zifu stage. Those that you guide and teach would
reach their full potential a tenth of the time they would normally reach on their own. The problem
of people that are good on the outside turning out to be completely evil on the inside is moot as
well, because any person you personally take on as a disciple will always feel a strong bond
towards you, to the point where even if you just gave someone a few pointers, they’d be willing to
shed tears for you on your deathbed."
208,600,Unending Breakthroughs,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Talent,"Bottlenecks are the
bane of many a Cultivator, causing many rising geniuses to be nothing more than annoying old
men in the face of the ever-expanding race that is martial Cultivation. Not for you however, as
bottlenecks that would otherwise completely cripple others simply act as small buffers that can be
easily cleared up with some time spent in the real world fighting opponents, or even something like
meditating while fishing. Needless to say, any time you would normally hit a roadblock, you can
overcome it just by spending a couple of months adventuring in the outside world, spending some
time to yourself, or facing a life and death battle. Anything unrelated really."
209,600,Freak of Nature,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Talent,"The Three Realms, despite
being a backwater to others in the Primordial Chaos, are filled with people that would be
considered utter monsters by any outsiders. People who manage to rise above their sub-par
cultivation methods and produce monsters on the level of Houyi, Ji Ning, Nuwa, Subhuti,
Tathagata, Suiren, Shennong, and Fuxi, all of whom would absolutely be feared for their genius.
Of course, you are no different, being an absolute freak of nature in the arts of cultivation and
understanding of the dao. Getting to the level of mastering a Grand Dao would take you maybe
thirty years or so, and becoming an Elder God would take you maybe twenty thousand years
through sheer brute force. Hell, even becoming a World level expert would be an inevitability
rather than a mere possibility, though the time it would take you could vary widely. And that’s

without any specializations. You may pick one aspect of Cultivation such as Heartforce, Sword
Arts, or Spacetime Techniques, in which you absolutely excel, to the point where it would allow
you to fight others one level higher than you, and train in it at an absolutely astonishing pace,
reminiscent to Ji Ning’s progress in the Sword Arts. For an extra 400 CP, undiscounted, you can
pick up one more specialization. You may purchase as many specializations as you wish."
210,600,Ascended Mentor,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Talent,"To raise a student to amazing heights brings pride to almost all masters around the Chaosverse.
They serve as a legacy, as well as a tool. Beacons to continue your name, as well as enforcers for
your school/clan. Thus it may be frustrating when your students stay one step below you, unable
to be truly useful to your own personal battles. Now, there is no such barrier. Even if you picked
a mortal from a chaosworld, with sufficient time and resources, they’d be able to reach the same
level you currently stand in. They might not be able to match you, but at the very least they’ll
provide incredibly useful assistance. The heights you can raise your students fail when you reach
the Autarch level, and unless you become an Omega Autarch, they won’t be able to step into that
level. If you wish you may also make it so your students will never surpass you in your current

strength."
211,600,The Man who understood infinity,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Talent,"One such as you who has a shocking and unseen talent can feel forced into a single path, the one
you are best at. But you did not become the greatest in the Three Realms simply for the sake of
being another specialist. No, you're a Genius, with a capital G. Whatever you find your most
interesting specialization, you can uplift other side projects to train just as fast. There is one
caveat however, that being that this can only be applied to five specialties at a time, though you
can switch between them with little to no fanfare. If you’re a master of the sword but have a deep
admiration for Spacetime, there’s no need to worry about talent anymore, you’ll have enough to

get to speed."
212,600,Blessed by the Sun God,Demon Slayer,Talent,"You did not awaken with the Demon Slayer Mark, you were born with it. Ever since you were young you have been stronger than most, and you only grew stronger over time. Because the mark is so deeply engraved into your body, it has undergone a change from the normal version, making you even stronger than it would make others along with a great increase in talent. Your Transparent World has gotten to the point where you can see individual blood vessels and sickness in people while also slowing the world down even more along with your thought processing being even faster. Most importantly, your Red Blade is much more potent, not only causing wounds to heal at a snail's pace for those with extremely fast regeneration and taking even more energy, but the wounds will continue to burn long after they have been healed, which will always leave nasty scars. Finally, those you train with will slowly be able to awaken their own marks, though only the first version."
213,600,A Million Ways,Campione,Talent,"Slavatore Doni, a heretic genius capable of matching any Great Knight with swordsmanship alone. Luo Cuilian, an absolute master of martial arts and Daoist Arts. They are grand warriors who faced gods with nothing but their honed skills, perfected to an inhuman degree, and came out winning the battle. Now, you join their ranks as the great master in one skill of your choice. Take blacksmithing and start forging weapons that can hold their ground against Authorities or Divination and start spoiling the hell of all those shows that are yet to finish. Sure, you could also choose swordsmanship and become the only decent practice buddy for Salvatore. In any case, you also gain a small boost in learning other skills directly tied to the one you choose."
214,600,Top Of The World,Trinity Wonder,Talent,"You aren’t just a fighter. You are one of the best. You were up there alongside the likes of the Dragon God and Demon King. Your martial talent is unbelievable. Reading an opponent's stance and predicting their moves comes naturally to you, and you are able to pick up techniques many times faster than your fellow warriors. Perhaps as a result of your great physical aptitude, you also have massive reserves of ki. Even if you were to be cut off from taking more ki in, it would be enough to last you through several full force fights. Finally, you have a powerful technique; a finisher move, one that could win most fights by itself, much like Wujin’s Vanquishing Rupture."
215,600,Kenpachi,Bleach,Talent,"You were always strong. Stronger than anyone you met. Maybe strong enough to be one of the strongest in all the worlds. But even as a kid, that strength limited you. How could you ever connect with others or learn from them? How could you ever enjoy a fight when you were swatting them like flies? Through your own subconscious action or the binding of another, this power was sealed away deep within as potential. Similar to Zaraki Kenpachi, you hold the potential for vast physical and spiritual power, along with a natural instinct for combat unmatched by almost any spiritual being. But this is largely inaccessible now. As you put yourself into deadly battles against worthy foes, you’ll see that power begin to return in leaps and bounds. Your muscles become denser, your spiritual pressure rages hotter and heavier with each battle, until you can eventually reach the same awakening of power as Zaraki did. Even after having reached your full potential, you’ll still have an effortless talent for all things relating to violence. Martial styles are easy to learn, becoming a capable user of techniques with a single day’s learning, and each battle you enter only increases your experience. With every fight, you become deadlier, even if there’s rarely a need to bother with your strength."
216,600,Fires of War,Bleach,Talent,"The crucible of war is where mankind has often made it’s greatest advancements. In power and
strategy, science and technology, even in growing as a moral species. Perhaps you’re something
similar, on an individual scale. Far more than most, conflict brings out your full potential. Not only in
combat but any competition or battle in which the stakes are high, you are able to grow and learn at
a far greater rate than is normal for you. Ordinary battles to the death will quickly sharpen your abilities but fatal fights that are also for the
sake of others you care for will greatly increase the benefits as the stakes rise higher. From huge
bounds in growth to potentially discovering entirely new powers, you can even use this conflict- derived growth to push past normal limits or caps on your potential and continue to increased your abilities. The benefits are potent but will begin to drop off as the stakes keep rising. For the sake of a
world, you could bring forth unheard of potential, but beyond such global stakes you’ll find little
more increases to be had."
217,600,Number One,Bleach,Talent,"Potential, what a terrifying concept. In every human soul, there is the potential to change the world.
It may only be through little actions for some but for others, like you, your potential marks you as
someone with the destiny to make great changes. In regards to war and spiritual power and the
innate abilities of a race, as well as all things connected to these concepts, your potential is almost
infinite. Exceeding even Ichigo Kurosaki, you are able to make what might take most Shinigami decades or even centuries in just months of work.
In regards to unlocking your own hidden potential, discovering abilities not yet available rather than
furthering your mastery of existing powers, your potential grows to even greater extents. The result
is that you will extremely quickly, perhaps in just half a year, gain access and capable skill with most
of the racial abilities and techniques available to you. Progress beyond that will still be astonishingly
fast, unbelievable to all but a prodigy and threatening even then, but not quite so swift as before. "
218,600,Just That Good ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Talent,"In the 80s and before, the power of sorcerers and cursed spirits was roughly balanced, or perhaps tipped slightly in the favour of the latter. Then, in 1989, Satoru Gojo was born, and the balance of power was forever shifted. Some of this was due to the sorcerer possessing both the Limitless technique and Six Eyes, but that was not all. He was also a natural innovator, someone who broke the limits of what was considered possible, to the point that even the King of Curses was surprised by the things he could pull off.

While you may lack in raw power, proficiency with cursed energy is something you have in excess. You have a great understand of not just any cursed technique you might have, but all of your supernatural powers. You’re fully aware of their limits and capabilities, allowing you to push them to their limits and pull off feats with them few others would expect. Your skill is at the level that for you, the rules of any power system or ability you use seem to be that bit looser. For instance, while normally one’s cursed technique is ‘burned out’ after using a Domain Expansion, making it unusable for a good while, you’d be able to figure out a way to heal your brain and regain your technique in a fraction of the time, something considered impossible by anyone else. Similarly, while some might only be able to fire an ability in a straight line, you’d be able to figure out how to make it curve around corners or even home in on your foes, and a technique that cuts things at range could be made to cut through space itself. You won’t be able to completely change the technique or power into something else, but so long as it’s still recognisably the original and doesn’t provide a direct increase in power, it’ll probably be possible."
219,600,Genius,Jujutsu Kaisen,Talent,"Knowledge itself is power. Such a statement may ring hollow in a world such as this, where certain beings are born with the innate ability to directly manifest the very concept of infinity in reality in order to warp space or increase their own mass to the point that they become a black hole, but there is still some truth to it. After all, while one may have a cursed technique from birth, this does not come with mastery of it, and a bit of intelligence can go a long way in this matter.

You’ve got an incredible intellect, enough that those around you would quite rightly consider you a genius. Learning new things comes easily to you, able to figure out the basics in no time at all, and reaching mastery in far less time than most others. Even if you were completely unaware of cursed energy’s very existence, upon becoming a sorcerer it wouldn’t even take you two weeks to become equal in power to a grade 1 sorcerer, just by figuring out its rules and the best ways to use it. For context, most sorcerers sit at grade 3 and will never even reach grade 2, and those with great levels of talent would usually take many years to achieve the level of mastery of their cursed technique needed for grade 1. Your intelligence undeniably lets you push your abilities to greater heights than most, coming up with uses for your techniques that would never have occurred to others. Who knows how far you could get in a few years of practice?

Naturally, your speed of learning also applies to mundane subjects, as well as other supernatural power systems you may come into possession of."
220,600,King of Curses ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Talent,"During the Golden Age of Jujutsu, many sorcerers with power surpassing the vast majority of modern sorcerers called Japan home. There was one, though, who stood above all others as the undisputed strongest in history. Born with a disfigured body uniquely suited for jujutsu sorcery, unsurpassed reserves of cursed energy, and a cursed technique of incredible power, this innate talent alone put him on the path for greatness. You may not share these traits, but there is one area in which you’re his equal: your raw ability with jujutsu.

Due to a combination of natural talent and training, your skill with cursed energy is at the very peak of this world. From fluidly switching between different techniques of yours to using even the most complex of abilities, all of this comes effortlessly to you. Though you don’t have the precision nor efficiency granted by the Six Eyes, it wouldn’t be wrong to say your understanding of cursed energy would be on par with someone who possessed them.

This understanding extends further than just your own cursed energy, though: it also allows you great insight into how others use it, too. Just by witnessing a cursed technique in action you’re able to quickly determine how it functions after just a few moments, letting you figure out its potential strengths and weaknesses. Not only that, but so long as it’s not something innate to the individual, you’ll be able to copy any usage of cursed energy after witnessing it a few times. While you can’t copy cursed techniques with this, if you had the same cursed technique as someone else you’d certainly be able to copy any abilities they’ve developed for it, and if you witnessed someone using reverse cursed technique to heal a burned-out cursed technique, you’d soon be able to do the same even if you previously thought it impossible."
221,600,Flashing Black,Jujutsu Kaisen,Talent,"A Black Flash is a rare phenomenon that all sorcerers are theoretically capable of, but few will ever achieve even once. When a sorcerer applies their cursed energy to a physical attack within a millionth of a second of the impact occurring, their energy becomes dyed black as it explodes outwards (hence the name). The results are dramatic: not only is the strength of the attack increased to the power of 2.5, it also causes the user to temporarily enter a state similar to ‘the zone’, where manipulating cursed energy becomes as easy as breathing. Naturally, this lets them operate at levels beyond their usual limits, at around 120% of their potential, and makes scoring consecutive Black Flashes far more likely.

While you’re not able to perform Black Flashes at-will, you have an incredible amount of skill and natural talent when it comes to manipulating your cursed energy. It would be incredibly simple to mislead your foes with your control, tricking them into thinking you’re doing something else with your energy until the very last moment, and your skill also makes any cursed techniques you possess a fair bit stronger, as you intuitively understand how to use your cursed energy in a more efficient manner. Of course, pulling off Black Flashes is much easier for you than most, to the point that they’re a pretty regular occurrence, and will only become more so with practice. And, in situations where you’re especially focused, such as a fight where your life is at significant risk, you’re practically guaranteed to pull off at least one.

The concept of Black Flashes may also be applied to any other supernatural energies you may possess, too."
222,600,Exceptional and Lucky ,Tsukihime,Talent,"The process of gaining true mastery of a Dead Apostle’s state of being, let alone becoming a full-fledged vampire, is a fundamentally slow one that is based on several different factors and the passage of time. It might even be...how do you say, impractical? So how do you keep speeding through all of it while barely knowing what you’re doing? This perk’s benefits are twofold - any sort of power or item that requires a ‘certain person’ to use it, you automatically qualify. For example if you needed a strong spiritual will to become a certain type of being, then undergoing the process to become that being would welcome and accept the change to your body. Secondly, all abilities that grow based on age or practice now take a considerable fraction of the time and effort needed for you to perfect it, perhaps even letting you develop a Reality Marble as an Apostle in a year as opposed to decades or centuries. I wonder what sort of madness created a being like you...?"
223,600,Jumper-Jin,The God of High School Jump,Talent,"No longer are you a relative beginner in the martial arts. With the purchase of this, you have become one of the strongest beings on Earth. Your skill with any Martial Arts or National Treasures that you have bought is on the level of a member of The Six, humans second only to Taejin Jin in power and skill. Your physical form as undertaken a similar boost in might, with all your physical attributes raised to absurdly superhuman levels. You could survive being punched from Seoul to Beijing, run back in a few minutes and then punch your attacker two hundred kilometres away, embedding them halfway into a mountain. You are not yet on the level of the High Gods but you’re closer than all but a dozen or two people in all the universe.

Boosted: So long has Humanity suffered under the yoke of the Gods. It is only recently that men and women capable of making a push for freedom have appeared. Men and women as mighty as yourself. That insatiable drive for freedom, or just revenge, against the Gods has granted you special powers against Divine beings. Your blows strike far harder against them, piercing through all but the greatest defenses that Divine beings can muster. And their counter attacks against you are dulled, reduced to a tenth of their full force. The Taboo still applies to you but the Gods will find it of little use.

Boost Requires Reincarnation(High God) to Activate"
224,600,Celestial Genius,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Talent,"Many brilliant geniuses have already lived, currently live
or will still be born in this world depending on when you arrived here. We’ve seem
genius like Orochimaru, which combined his mad science and forbidden jutsu to
push the limits of knowledge and make both wonders and horrors, and Amado,
which originally was already a specialist on the field of cloning and genetic
engineering but made several technological advancements on other fields after
joining Kara, but, in the end, these two geniuses are ultimately human. As a celestial
being, your intellect is now compared to both of them combined, having a
generalized understanding of several academics and scientific disciplines and a
talent in working with mundane technologies and with technologies that utilizes
supernatural energies like mechanisms powered by chakra, as well as having a
specialization on a field of your choice. If you choose robotics as your specialization,
you could make war machines powerful as a Tailed Beast with the right materials
and enough effort for example. With time and effort, you could make several
discoveries and advancements even outside your specialization, like discovering
how to give biological immortality to living beings, actually transferring minds through
scientific means, artificially replicate existing dōjutsu or even create your own
customized ones, a feat that even Amado would classify as belonging to the realms
of the gods, but, after all, you’re basically a divine being yourself."
225,600,Herculean Skill,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Talent,"Were you raised alongside Heracles, learning the arts of war with your cousin Demigod? It might be
one of the few situations that explain your outrageous skill with all forms of combat. Be it sword, bow, spear, wrestling or any other weapon that can be found in this time, you hold divine levels of
skill with them. Even warriors that are many times stronger and faster than you can find themselves
hopeless against your arts of combat. It’s possible to find people that manage to surpass you, somewhat, but they are few and far between, such as comparing your archery to that of Atalanta’s. 

Still, while you may not be outright perfect in skill, you have a special benefit that no one else but
Heracles seems to have. You can create martial techniques that act like spells, drawing on your
stamina in order to use weapons to accomplish supernatural things. Using your knowledge of the
bow to create a combat move that allows you to shoot a hundred arrows in a single motion, which
will endlessly kill anything it strikes down even once to completely counteract most forms of
regeneration and immortality, like what Heracles used against the Hydra. Once you’ve done these, you can effortlessly adapt the technique to other weapons or even the use of magic or your own
body. It may lose in effectiveness, such as your hundred bow shots becoming nine slashes of the
sword or nine beams of energy, but this adaptation is instant, compared to the several days of
practice your techniques usually require, and the new forms of techniques can even be made suited
to specific kinds of foes in minutes of focus."
226,600,King Maker,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Talent,"Your place is not at the forefront of this story but behind the curtain. Yours is the hand that guides
the heroes to success, raising farm girls to be kings and serving boys to slay dragons. You are the
maker of kings and bringer of heroes and this is only too apparent in how you can guide others. Even
should you lack knowledge of the specific path your proteges may wish to pursue, your constant
presence and tutelage brings out vastly more potential than should be possible for your students. People discover brand new powers and levels of strength that they did not believe they had and may
very well truly lacked before you took charge. Lessons and study that should take half a lifetime can
be compressed to just days for even a dull brat to digest. The ones who call you mentor and master
are almost assured of becoming legends that are known throughout the world and will continue to
be remembered for centuries after they pass. Of course, they also develop a loyal affection for you, even if you are a strange, oft annoying and troublesome teacher to have."
227,600,Bogatyr of the Fair Sun,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Talent,"The Sovereign of the Sun, Dobrynya Nikitich, was said to be a mighty young warrior, serving the Grand Prince of Kiev. His deeds are still spoken of in Bylina, where historical fact and fantasy ever so often meet. But now he may have an equal as your more than a match for even the mightiest Bogatyr. Your strength and speed is enough to go into battle against Dragons, though it is not a fight you would be guaranteed to win. Still the punishment of such a Beast you could endure, even hails of Bullets from Beasts designed to kill.

But of course what is a Hero without the skill to use their strength? Saving princesses and slaying Monsters just comes naturally to you. Some may think your claim of being able to do ‘Just About Anything’ isn’t entirely farfetched, as you are simply competent in whatever is needed, like say cheering up an ally, getting food, raising a spirit or even just fighting someone way out of your league. Now you can't DO anything, only do lots of things. You wouldn’t be able to destroy trees that simulate entire Worlds for example but you may just be able to put up a great fight against a single great Tyrant. Though at least you know what is truly impossible to you, just so you can bother trying for what you could somehow pull off.

But where you truly shine is on top of a mount. Your skill at Riding is legendary, far beyond what any human should be capable of. What it is you ride, be it a monster or a vehicle, ill maters. As long as you can count it as a form of transportation you can do just that with the kind of skill only a Hero of an Epic could replicate. Of course combat on top of your steed is also all but instinctual, perhaps even greater than it would be on foot. Lastly, thanks to your newfound connection to the Sun, entities or deities aligned with it are a little bit more fond of you and may even ask for your help on occasion."
228,600,Root of all Swords,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Talent,"For years, you swung your blade in pursuit of a greater truth. While others sought power or wealth
or glory in battle, your blade pulled you onwards past where they all faltered. As you learned, others
fell in droves to your skill. Maybe before you even looked back and realised just how far beyond
other swordsmen you have already come.

You have reached a level of swordsmanship that cannot be described as just supernatural or divine. To the eyes of the few others on your level, they describe it as having reached the Truth of the
World with a single cut. The result is the ability to accomplish many impossible feats through your
sword style. Cutting any physical material, repelling vastly superior opponents from a location your
guard without injury to yourself, cutting through armies of threatening foes with grace and fluidity. Even with the body of an ordinary man, rather than some powerful heroic form, you remain one of
the most lethal combatants in Japan. Your style currently culminates in a single perfect expression of
your talent, which has been taken so far as to warp reality itself. A technique that incorporates the
Second Magic to cut three times with one slash, creating an inescapable prison of steel, is the best
known example.

But this peak you have reached is just the base of another mountain, as you have the ability to
rapidly bring new techniques to such a supreme level. Your repertoire, provided you continue your
harsh practice, will likely see new abilities like this every few months. Additionally, bringing other
sword-based fighting styles to the level you have reached with this one is a speedy process of
around a year’s practice, your existing skills easily bridging the gap. "
229,600,Harvesting the Ingredients,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"Around here many spirit beasts are used for high level dishes. To get them chefs have to venture out and gather the necessary ingredients themselves. You may not be a legendary warrior, but you are an unmatched hunter when it comes to slaying powerful beasts and monsters. Whether it’s slaying a dragon to gather its ribs or fighting a supreme ranked tree in order to get its fruit for wine you have the necessary know-how to deal with these creatures.
"
230,600,Lord of War,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"In the end there is always one rule that holds true in worlds such as these might makes right. Regardless of your position or talents, power in the end is the deciding factor when dealing with conflicts here. This perk won’t increase your cultivation, but it will make you a true lord of war. You possess truly frightening combat prowess. Even if you only possessed an average technique you would easily be capable of fighting off and killing multiple beings a level higher than you. Should you actually have the techniques and cultivation to back up your wrath then few if any in this world could stand against you in combat. 
"
231,600,Once in a Generation,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"Every so often there will be a being born with truly legendary talent. It appears that you are this so-called blessed individual. You have talent required to reach the pinnacle of cultivation. You will never have to face any bottlenecks or restrictions as you cultivate. Your only requirements will be to gather the necessary energy and insights at each level. The only question is whether or not you will live long enough to develop yourself. 
"
232,600,Unrivaled Talent,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"While your cultivation is important that doesn’t mean that it is the sole factor behind your prowess. There are many who specialize in a chosen field and devote themselves completely to it. This perk allows you to choose three specialities which you will receive virtually unrivaled talent in. For example you could choose swordsmanship, body cultivation, movement techniques. This would allow you to become a legendary swordsman wielding immense strength and speed. This pekr is discounted if you purchase it multiple times.

"
233,600,Legendary Alchemist,Gourmet Of Another World,Talent,"Alchemy is the art of creating pills and other elixirs using various ingredients. Many would consider it a superior form of cooking at least when comparing the average member of each profession. This perk grants you talent equivalent to that of a legendary alchemist. In addition all qualities related to alchemy will be boosted as well. This would include the strength of your soul, your will power, and your ability to manipulate flames. If you can reach the peak perhaps you will eventually be known as the God of Alchemy. 
"
234,600,Doctor’s In,Beware Of Chicken,Talent,"Doctors are important no matter where or when you go. And when it comes
to being a doctor, you are one of the best. Around here anyway. You now
have all the training of a doctor from Hong Yaowu (the 'Medicine
Warehouse') complete with having spent days on end delving the archives
of Verdant Hill for more teachings. This combined with your natural talent
for medicine and poison makes you among the best doctors in the province
even as a mortal. If you were to become a Cultivator, you just might end up
one of the best doctors in the entire Empire one day."
235,600,Dancing Through the Danger,Beware Of Chicken,Talent,"A long lost secret of the Azure Hills is that most, if not all, of the Cultivation
styles the Sects use were not originally meant for combat. They were
artisanal. The Verdant Blade Sect came from what was once actors on a
stage, captivating hearts and minds through elaborate dances. That was
the past, the present is a crude imitation, but the future lies in mixing the
two. A future you will embody. As such, you have immense Martial Talent
and a non Martial Talent that you can blend together in either direction."
236,600,THE LORD MAGISTRATE,Beware Of Chicken,Talent,"You are the equal to the one and only THE LORD MAGISTRATE. This
entails excellence in every mundane aspect of your life, the diligence to
maintain it through continual training, the keen observation to spot
problems coming from miles away, and the wherewithal to personally
ensure the job gets done on time and up to standard. It won't be long

before your citizens earnestly call you Patriarch. This also optionally makes
genuinely earned praise much more satisfying."
237,600,Genius Rare as Qilin Horns and Phoenix Feathers,Against The Gods,Talent,"To be the heir of a mighty clan, you
must be a great genius like no other, even among the luminaries of your generation. You are
undoubtedly one such figure.
Your rate of learning new things, techniques and ideas and even entirely new arts, is something
almost beyond imagining. You are a peerless genius, the kind of person who can master entire
martial styles, or new fields of magic or practice, in days, weeks at the most.
This doesn’t just affect your mind, either. Your body can keep up perfectly with everything your
mind learns, growing at an equal pace with every new insight you gain."
238,600,Heaven Defying Bottleneck Transcender,Against The Gods,Talent,"As your powers grow, as your strength
reaches higher and more advanced levels, advancing further becomes ever more difficult.
Not for you. No one knows how, maybe you can somehow access the richer energies and better
quality laws of the Higher Realms, maybe you can just grasp certain crucial principles others miss, it
depends on the circumstances. But the result is the same.
Where others would require decades, if not centuries to grow through a level, not to mention
proportionately higher effort, you simply don’t suffer these diminishing returns or bottlenecks. You
can advance through even the highest levels of cultivation just as easily and quickly as you grew
through the very first ones, while losing none of the benefits."
239,600,Battle Senses,Cradle,Talent,"There's a song to every fight, and you've got your finger on it's beat.
You can fight three of your equals with your eyes closed and come out the better for it, simply
by understanding the flow of combat around you, the way the wind rushes around blades and
projectiles, the way the magic in the air tenses before a strike, etc. Even if you were genuinely
struck blind, you would never be the worse for wear."
240,600,I Can Do That To,Dragon Ball,Talent,"As you might imagine both Cell and Majin Buu had powerful comprehensive abilities.
Both warriors were capable of mimicking any technique they witnessed. You too share
this frightening comprehensive prowess. As long as something can be classified as a
skill or technique you can perform it perfectly after witnessing it done once. This
includes spiritual or soul based skills such as instant transmission. The only abilities you
cannot replicate are those that belong to a bloodline. For example, you could learn any
jutsu in Naruto aside from something like Amaterastu. Your innate comprehension
however, might allow you to replicate it using other similar skills."
241,600,Unmatched Talent,Dragon Ball,Talent,"Frieza’s talent is honestly horrifying, many consider the only reason he isn’t unmatched
is due to his own lazy nature. Even without training he managed to become one of the
strongest beings in the universe. Within a mere few months he nearly reached the level
of the gods. Given a decade he could become a peer of Gods of Destruction in raw
power. By taking this perk you may acquire this unrivaled talent for yourself. This perk
will affect all forms of growth and development you possess."
242,600,Perfect Latent Talent,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Talent,"Your talent is instead absurdly, outrageously good, almost as if an immensely powerful 9
Essences Paragon meticulously designed you, body and soul, to be the most talented person in
the entire Vast Expanse. You are like Meng Hao’s clone Fang Mu late in the story, with the most
perfect bones, soul and blood, and all the other factors that matter in determining latent talent.
Such is your talent that, with access to sufficient resources, you could achieve Foundation
Establishment in one year, Core Formation in another, and keep this going much in the same
way Fang Mu did. You could become a True Immortal within a decade of starting cultivation is
what it means.
And in all future worlds too, your talent in just about anything you try your hand at remains
similar, adapting to the local cultivation/magic/whatnot.
Note however that this does not conjure knowledge out of nothing, it merely increases the rate
at which you grow and improve, and it is still possible to advance in the wrong direction if you
don’t know what you’re doing."
243,600,Progenitor Of Cultivation,A Will Eternal,Talent,"Like Bai Xiaochun would one day be, you are a progenitor of cultivation. When you go to
worlds or universes without cultivation, you can spread it to there with ease. Simple
instructions and guidance can see people learning the arts by the thousands, who can then
pass on the teachings themselves. As the originator of these techniques, you are also able
to influence the cultivation system to a degree. Maybe, like Bai Xiaochun, you wish to limit
how easily people can advance between levels and wish to introduce Heavenly Tribulations?
Users of your cultivation system will be able to tell instinctively that you are the originator of
these techniques. They may even start to worship you for it."
244,600,Divine Disaster,A Will Eternal,Talent,"If there is one thing that Bai Xiaochun is famous for to the population of the Eternal realm, it
is his ability to cause disasters wherever he goes. So bad is he, that great celebrations are
held when he leaves his current residence for prolonged periods of time. His pill concocting
caused poisonous rain and thunderous lightning. His pills themselves drove people mad with
their effects, and more often than not had strange effects that even he didn’t know or expect.
Even something as simple as him cultivating had side effects that destroyed prisons and
arrays, and broke the foundations of sects. You’ve inherited that particular talent of his,
letting you cause great disturbances with even the most peaceful of things. Luckily it tends to
work out in your favour in the end somehow, but well, there’s always an element of danger
involved when disasters follow you. Why would you want something like this Jumper? It’s not
going to earn you too many friends."
245,600,Experience Like a River,Generic Exalted,Talent,"Experience flows like a river for you, and you'll be making
incredible leaps and bounds in training and personal development at speeds that might just
terrify the casual observer. As a mortal this gives you the equivalent of an Exalts ability in
learning speed and training times, able to master specific skills in weeks or months that would
take mortals lifetimes, and able to push yourself mentally and physically such that you'd be at
the absolute top of your game in almost no time at all.
As an Exalt this is amplified even further, compressing into days what would take other Exalts
weeks. Additionally any skills you have will never degrade from lack of use, you'll be able to take
that one obscure skill you learned hundreds of years ago and use it at the same level of skill it
used to be, as if no time had passed at all. To elaborate this doesn’t let you exceed the limit or
‘cap’ on any skills or abilities you might have, but it will let you reach those limits in a bare
fraction of the time it normally would."
246,600,Exalted Ways Dominance,Generic Exalted,Talent,"As one of the Dragon-blooded you were trained from birth to
excel in the areas in which you showed talent, and you showed a great many talents indeed.
Choose any seven of the following - War, Melee, Martial Arts, Archery, Thrown, Riding, Sailing,
Socializing, Athletics, Awareness, Dodge, Bureaucracy, Crafting, Integrity, Investigation,
Larceny, Linguistics, Lore, Medicine, Occult, Performance, Presence, Stealth, Survival, or
Resistance. You are now the undisputed master of those seven skills. This is in addition to any
skills or abilities you would normally be good at on account of your Caste or 'favored' choices.
You can do things with the seven skills you have chosen while half drunk and blind on your
worst day that the greatest mortal practitioners would never be able to replicate, even on their
best day, in their entire lives.
 Additionally you can train anyone that you personally tutor in these seven abilities and they will
quickly reach a level of skill close to, but just short of, your own level of skill. They will learn at a
rate equivalent to an Exalt so long as you personally teach them, even if they aren't an Exalt.
If you chose Dodge you might one day be able to walk through a rainstorm without getting wet.
If you choose Archery you might strike a man’s heart from over the horizon while he is standing
in the middle of a forest. If you chose Bureaucracy the sheer efficiency and speed with which
your organization operates will baffle even the most astute observers and leave competitors
hopelessly scrambling to catch up. Choosing Medicine might allow you to perform brain surgery
with a rusty knife using only one hand, and have the patient come out the other side perfectly
healthy. Point blank the things you can manage with your chosen skills would be outright
impossible for nearly anyone else to replicate, even other Essence users needing to ‘cheat’ and
use Charms in order to match what you can do with nothing but your own innate talent. You
may purchase this perk up to three times, each time it is purchased you must select different
abilities."
247,600,Jumper Hero Style,Generic Exalted,Talent,"Your nature as a world (and dimension) crossing Jumper has
changed the fundamental nature of your being and understanding. Your many experiences
across many worlds has given you the necessary insight and mental fortitude to truly grasp the
nature of Martial Arts. You can learn any supernatural martial arts style native to any
world/Jump you happen to find yourself in, even if you don't actually have a mentor to teach you
how to do it, so long as it is not an option that requires you to pay for it with CP (a restriction that
is lifted Post-Spark). Through either dumb luck or keen insight you'll just stumble into the correct
move set, frame of mind, and if necessary secret-hidden-potential needed in order to become a
practitioner.
In effect this means you'll always be able to learn any form of supernatural martial arts even if
you lack the qualities, genetics, special destiny, knowledgeable teacher, strong soul, or
whatever that you would normally require in order to learn them. For this Jump specifically this
means you can learn Sidereal Martial Arts even if you aren't a Sidereal (or even if you're just a
mortal) and, further, you're a lot better at it than you should be. You've got a natural talent and
insight for martial arts that allows you to get a lot more mileage out of these styles than normal
practitioners, able to fight harder, longer, faster, and just all around better than your peers.
You require less Essence, ki, qi, magic, chakra, chi, or any other energy source in order to
power any supernatural Martial Art that you know. You must have been to a Jump in order to
learn/practice any special martial arts from that Jump, so no learning how to make your hand
glow with an awesome power unless you've been there first."
248,600,Prosperity of the Sun,Solars Exalted,Talent,"War and blood does not build a nation, shining wonders do not
create happiness in one’s people, and Exaltation does not make one inherently fit as a ruler.
You are unique in that you have internalized these truths and fully understand what is needed to
create true prosperity in both yourself and your subjects. You understand economics and
politics with complete mastery of both, but you also know how to build a lasting nation or
organization that can sustain itself without you having to constantly reinforce it with Charms or
other abilities. In addition, changes you make in the world...whether building monuments,
kingdoms, or slaying a great menace will have a permanent and lasting effect - your dynasty will
last for thousands of years beyond your own era, your legend is told for many years to come,
and your cities will be full of life even if the world around it should be torn apart. This effect can
be mitigated or ‘turned off’ at your leisure if you prefer subtlety or impermanence."
249,600,Mind of the Sun,Solars Exalted,Talent,"Many speak of the First Age and its lost wonders, forgotten and quietly
waiting for the return of their masters. However, far too many fixate on what was and what could
have been, instead of looking towards the future, and you are not one who has time to waste
rummaging around old ruins for secrets. Your Exaltation holds many of the lost knowledge of
crafting and forging great Artifacts, as well as lost sciences of the First Age such as biogenesis.
You begin with the basic knowledge and fluency in Old Realm, as well as mastery of the various
sciences and ways of crafting from the First Age, able to forge weapons, warstriders, and other
items of legend to add to your own panoply. As a bonus, you know how to substitute magical

materials for such items with their mundane equivalents or metals in other worlds - useful in
worlds without materials such as orichalum."
250,600,Primordial Psychologist,Infernals Exalted,Talent,"For all that the Green Sun Princes emulate the Yozi, and the ancient Solars fought and
bound them, there are few amongst them that truly understand how the minds of the fallen
Primordials work. Very few savants in Creation even have any kind of idea of what the Yozis
are, as a group, or how they work, much less in-depth psychological profiles of particular
titans or a clear view of their history. To truly understand the Yozi, one needs a working
model for how endless seas of consciousness and alien minds forged raw from chaos
translate into observable behavior patterns, and for how a thing beyond mortal rationality can
function in a superior yet irrational fashion.
You've got a astonishing talent for understanding alien, bizarre minds and beings, able to
easily pick up on their subtleties and obsessions. As such, you've even managed to gain an
understanding on the behavior and thought processes of the Yozi, and how they influence
their souls and are influenced in turn. This isn't just limited to the minds of the Architects of
Creation, but you'll have to spend some time interacting with or observing other beings to
grasp their particular psyche.
Of course in the course of your research into the minds of the mad titans, you have learned
a great deal more... The legends and accounts of the time before reality, the tales of lost
Zen-Mu, the birth of Creation itself, and the long histories from before and after their
imprisonment within Malfeas. Even the histories and lore of demonkind are open to you now,
most of the knowledge contained within Orabilis' glass libraries already known to you. But
your intimate understanding of the Primordial condition gives you one other benefit, as it
allows you to translate the supernatural powers of one Yozi to another as the Yozi
themselves do. Through this, you may adapt the charms you know of one Yozi into an
equivalent that uses the themes of a second Yozi. But remember that this is by and large
merely aesthetic, and some sufficiently different abilities may prove impossible to translate."
251,600,Lawgiver of Death,Abyssals Exalted,Talent,"The Children of Dust have a penchant for leadership and treachery. They often lead their
circles, possessing the guile to hold a circle together in spite of rivalry or dislike. In Creation
this tendency to leadership is often stifled by their Dark Fate. As the burden of Resonance
makes direct control extremely difficult, these deathknights produce social change through
proxies, conspiracy, terrorism or other indirect means. But it is in the Underworld itself that
their true potential for leadership shines through, for it is there that they may act with the full
authority of the murdered architects of the universe.
Necromancers and Deathlords might rule the dead through fear and spells of binding, but
you have no need to force obedience through such methods. The dead know their rightful
ruler when they look upon you, and most shall be eager to follow your commands and swear
themselves to your service. While the mindless, reanimated dead will not gain the faculties
to swear themselves into service, you may still command them as you will and they shall
never raise their rotted claws against you. Even those ghost and mindless undead bound
through necromancy refuse to act against you or disobey your orders. Just, don’t expect
such mighty rulers as the Deathlords to prostrate themselves.
But a wise king need more than obedience, and you too have gained the virtues a good ruler
needs. Being an old hand at matters of court and government, at the labors of bureaucracy

and lawmaking, and at that most important of talents... delegation. Knowing whom to trust
with which aspects of your realm, and whose counsel you can trust to be wise."
252,800,Eight Hundred Years of Cutting  - Mastery,UQ Holder,Talent,"With all that time, it’d be mad if you hadn’t gained something already. You’ve managed to reach Juuzou’s level in swordsmanship or a similarly broad field. With a blade in your hand, you could slice even a Vampire Noble in half despite not having nearly the raw strength to actually do so. Cut through space to reach the 4th dimension, slice the concept of an apple to cause those around you to forget what an apple is, cause massive explosions by cutting atoms or even cut a cut to prevent another cut. The process of your training, even if it is not towards combat uses, has also refined your body to an exceptional degree. While your strength and durability is only moderate for the higher end of this world, you have incredible amounts of speed and agility, enough to surprise and outpace great wizards and warriors like Evangeline or Jinbei."
253,800,Divine Skill,Bleach,Talent,"Every single Shinigami who has been raised to the vaunted heights of Squad Zero has accomplished
something incredible. Each one is a master of a skill to a level considered impossible to all others, taking something useful but mundane and making it akin to the work of a god. One is a swordsmith, whose works are the Zanpakuto that form the core of Shinigami power. One a seamstress whose
ordinarily clothes withstand attacks with ease from all but the greatest Captains. The oldest among
them is a monk who has given names to all things and controls the very names themselves, giving
great power over the world. While you may not necessarily have been offered a place yet, though also possessing sufficient
power may change this, you have mastered a certain skill or idea to a similar level as the current
members. Skills are obvious and described both above and below but ideas are also possible.
Ichibe’s title as the one who names others has allowed him to manipulate names as a concept, altering or controlling others through their names. In his sealed form, this is largely limited to an innate knowledge of all names, the ability to draw power from others speaking his name and to lay
notably powerful curses or other effects on names that activate when spoken. Whatever you pick allows for incredible uses and techniques just on it’s own, such as the above
techniques described. It’s almost certain that you have also created some great invention connected
to your chosen skill, which may have already spread through Soul Society and brought fame to your
name. A master of Kido who created stick-shaped implements that allow even a beginner to work
powerful magics, a swordmaster whose written lessons have revolutionised Zanjutsu by introducing
magical techniques not connected to release forms or kido, perhaps even something like an author
whose stories have inspired and directed the afterlife again and again. However your skill and the accompanying great invention appear, there is a second aspect to this
option. Whatever your skill or idea is, it is also linked directly to your Zanpakuto. Releasing your
Zanpakuto will greatly expand what you are able to accomplish with your skill. This works in concert
with it’s existing abilities, which may alter the form of the blade and the powers to complement each
other better. Ichibe’s Shikai, a large brush which could manipulate ink, allowed him to suppress and
erase others by covering them, and thus their names, in black ink. His Bankai grew this to the point
that he could directly change or give new names to beings, with the properties of their new name
becoming true. The most powerful warrior reduced to the strength of a helpless ant, as that is what
his name had become. Your Zanpakuto releases will likely be supercharged by this process, greatly
improving the existing powers as a result of them combining with such divine skill. It is also worth
remembering that these powers are not without limit. The released state of this skill will require
your spiritual energy to operate and some uses, though theoretically possible, may be of too great a
magnitude to actually work. Those without a Zanpakuto can eventually unlock independent release states that give access to two
increased levels of power with your chosen divine skill. These two release stages will drain your
energy similar to a Shikai and Bankai but at least allow access to your full potential."
254,800,Peerless,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Talent,"The knights of Britain are renown for their skill, power and honour. The knights of the Round Table exemplify Britain’s virtues to an even greater extent. You? Lancelot at his height is the only one you can call a peer and he doesn’t remain there for long. Few men are as perfectly well rounded as you. Your physical abilities are enough that you could fight powerful adult dragons and demons to a draw with your bare hands or even win if you added a good weapon to your side. You’ve got unbelievable levels of martial skill in both offense and defense, across two dozen kinds of weapons, such that even without your physical abilities being so great you could slay armies. You have strategic and tactical abilities that let you lead small forces to crush far larger ones and can even make a good substitute for a king if your liege needs to spend a few months away at war, though you are far below the sort of king that can create a golden age. You have a high level of natural talent at any skill or ability you try your hand at and find it very easy to learn and train to become better at new things, quickly surpassing even the most venerable of warriors in their specialties. Of course, you would not be peerless if you did not also look the part. Among all the men in the world, only the divine could outmatch your physical splendour and even then, only by a touch. Your king might frown on the hordes of maidens that lust after you but you really can’t help it, as you gather admirers and love interests even when fully armoured and masked. Just something about you."
