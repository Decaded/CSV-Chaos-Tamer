,CP Cost,Name,Jumpchain,Chapter,Description
1,Free,Beautiful,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Providence,"You are very beautiful, guaranteed to be
beautiful enough make the majority of the opposite sex think you
are hot. This won’t shift your appearance to something you find
ugly."
2,Free,Required Secondary Abilities,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Providence,"The laws of this Universe are very different from those
you are used to, and things such as moving faster than sound are possible for even the most base
rank and file Yet they find themselves lacking things such as sonic booms. In this Universe and the
ones you will travel to in the future, such protections will thusly continue to exist. In addition to
this, spending countless years on a single task, or just on living a normal life, also don’t seem to be
a problem for you anymore."
3,Free,Infernal Governance,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"You would hardly be a noble if you couldn’t look and act the part. Luckily this is something
you have internalised completely, able to project a sense of dignity, grace, and nobility
through your body language. And you don't just look like it, you also have experience with
politics and governance, to the point that you would be able to walk into near any court in
Creation and be accepted, while you would actually be able to be a good ruler. Of course to
live the lifestyle of the nobility, you'll need a certain amount of wealth. It is a good thing then,
that you're just as skilled in selling whatever you wish, finding the appropriate buyers, and
setting up a shop to do so. Lastly this makes you skilled at coming up with convoluted plots
to accomplish your goals, which somehow seem to work better than simpler schemes."
4,Free,Language Comprehension,Mushoku Tensei,Providence,"The Six-Faced World has many languages and going from one continent to another without learning the
language there would make you unable to communicate with other people. This grants you an ability
to understand, speak and read any language that you heard people speak and seen its words in hours. When
speaking to someone with a different language that you didn’t learn, you can instinctively guess the general
meaning of their words and slowly piece them together to form words allowing you to speak the said language
down to their accent with enough time. Seeing written words of an unknown language constant exposure or
trying would allow you to slowly piece it together allowing you to read the written words with enough
time. This also allows you to invent your language or decryption to prevent others from knowing your secrets
that you wrote in books that you don’t want others to find out about."
5,50,Angelic Beauty,Dragon Ball,Providence,"As per is standard for most anime worlds everyone here seems to look like a model
particularly the powerful and important figures. By taking this perk you can be included
in this group and become an incredibly attractive figure. This beauty can also be suited
to giving off a suitable aura such Vados’s angelic beauty, or
Towa’s devilish charm. This will also remove any imperfections you have and ensure
that any future defects are pleasing.
Alternatively if you aren’t satisfied then you may upgrade this option for another 150 CP.
With this you may gain an unmatched appearance like the Time King or the Great
Heaven Official. Their beauty is grand enough to hypnotize powerful experts with their
mere presence. Xiaya even acknowledged that they were more beautiful than his wives
and that their beauty shouldn’t appear in the world."
6,50,Slightly Meta,Generic Exalted,Providence,"At any time you can call up a purely mental ‘statistics sheet’ that will
faithfully represent your various attributes, abilities, specialties, charms known, sorcery or
necromancy known, and so forth. Almost as if you were looking at an Exalted character sheet of
yourself. Translates out of jump abilities, perks, and such as well, though it’s not quite as
precise about it, to allow you to keep an accurate and objective running tally of your progress.
As a side benefit you will never be lost when people start using metaphor or meta-references.
You will always understand what they are talking about when they say ‘we need to go deeper’.
This doesn’t give you fourth wall awareness of course, but you’ll know when that crazy guy is
actually crazy or just using meta-speak."
7,100,The Immortal Life,UQ Holder,Providence,"All immortals eventually face the challenges that come with eternal life, if they live long enough. Some find ways to cope with the boredom, the loss of friends, and the fear that mortals have of them. Some do not. You, however, seem to have skipped the process of dealing with those issues entirely. The immortal life is effortlessly manageable for you. You never feel bored, no matter how many years pass without activity. You easily come to terms with the aging and deaths of friends and loved ones, and you have no trouble reintegrating into society, appearing as an ordinary person despite having no records or history."
8,100,Spring Of Life,UQ Holder,Providence,"Perhaps you no longer suffer the boredom that immortals face, but it does not mean you can push yourself without limit. At least, it didn’t before. You have an endless wellspring of motivation and energy inside you, something that pushes you to always be willing to get up and try again at what you’re stuck on. You’ll never have the issue of lazing around when you know you should work and can always dedicate yourself fully even to the most unpleasant of tasks."
9,100,Team Mom,UQ Holder,Providence,"Over the years, you had to learn to fend for yourself. Unless you wanted to eat raw meat, you had to learn to cook. If you didn’t want to have a dusty cave to hide in, cleaning time it was. A few weird encounters even had you raising children. You got pretty good at it all even. One might even say fantastic at all kinds of housework and child-rearing skills. You only seem to get better at it when doing that housework for someone you care for, making your meals or efforts all the better. Maybe it’s true what they say about something being made with love."
10,100,Free Of Debts,UQ Holder,Providence,"Can you imagine actually living long enough to pay back all those debts? It’d be a nightmare. Especially if you’re not the careful type when you fight. All that potential collateral damage to be had, magic really isn’t any joke. So long as you don’t intend to cause damage for malicious reasons, collateral damage caused by you won’t come back to haunt you. If you were fending off the bad guy and accidentally destroyed a few homes, you won’t need to foot the bill for them and no one would have gotten hurt either. If you knowingly decide to shoot through a house to get the bad guy… maybe a different story."
11,100,Hope,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Hope. Perhaps the biggest lie. To have hope is to have your dreams smashed and belief shattered. But this lie can also fuel you. When you have Hope, no matter what it is, it is much harder to break you. Perhaps sometimes lies are helpful."
12,100,Habitual Drunk,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"It is hard to outdrink you. It seems something in your body craves the stuff, and you need it badly. No one, no matter who, can ever outdrink you. Ever."
13,100,Drunken Brawler,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"While drunk, it appears luck and fortune are on your side. When drunk, not only do you become stronger than normal, but you also become more likely, dodging at the perfect moments to avoid attacks, and such."
14,100,Famous Iron Soul,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"When wearing armor, the armor feels like nothing on you, and doesn’t inhibit your stamina at all, regardless of how thick and heavy the armor is."
15,100,Friendly Face,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"You naturally seem to get people to trust you, whether by your looks or mannerism, you come across as gentle and nurturing and friendly. Just be careful, there are some who view this as a weakness."
16,100,"Good Breeding
","A Cultivator's Beginning",Providence,"You possess significant beauty, charisma, and social skills. Those who interact with you in an amicable manner find it a joy to continue their relationship with you, whatever it may be. You know your way around society, and society will gladly accommodate you.

In addition, you find it easier to learn the ways of foreign civilizations, and foreigners will tend to treat you better than they would have without this perk."
17,100,Etiquette,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Providence,"You are instinctively knowledgeable about the etiquette and deference
that must be shown in any martial art or martial culture. You are aware of faux pas or mild signs
of disrespect and will subconsciously avoid making them. You know how to show respect as
well as where and when it is best to show it without being considered a sycophant or rude. So
long as the culture is rooted in combat and discipline, you will never offend someone unless you
actively seek to do "
18,100,"Ladies’ Man",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"If ever a true alpha male existed, you’d be a top contender. You
possess an animalistic charisma. Sufficient displays of dominance
and aggression engender a blend of fear, awe, and desire in
onlookers"
19,100,An Endless Banquet,Baki The Grappler,Providence,"What’s the point of strength with nobody to fight? With this, you’ll never be short on overconfident delinquents or mutated beasts that just can’t help picking fights with you"
20,100,A Face you Wouldn’t Believe,Baki The Grappler,Providence,"A warrior takes pride in his scars, but do you really want to ruin these looks? Your face is
abnormally resistant to injury. This won’t help if someone is deliberately targeting your
eyes with enough strength crush them, but anything less will heal up seamlessly. Hell, you
could walk through reinforced glass face-first if you felt so inclined."
21,100,"He Who Fights, and Runs Away",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"Ancient battles weren’t as soft as those today. You have a way with words lets you twist
cowardly acts into something almost respectable. You didn’t run away, it was a tactical
retreat, you didn’t beg for your life, it was psychological warfare, so long as you don’t
overuse this, you can speak with enough confidence to convince most listeners. –"
22,100,Such Excess,Baki The Grappler,Providence,"You treat the body with what can only be called extreme
rationality. You’d sooner reach into your own wound to
check if your insides are okay, take shrapnel into your eye
without blinking (though it will still hurt), and treat your
opponent’s skeleton as mere grappling points. You have the
mentality that looks at the body like the flesh machine it is,
expanding the tactics available to you. –"
23,100,"Taking Care of the Dishes",Baki The Grappler,providence,"Not all familial relationships are straightforward. Some families bare nothing resembling
fondness, or cross lines that should not be crossed. Still, with enough pig-headedness,
you can force the most twisted familial relationships into something normal-adjacent. It
may still seem distorted to an outsider viewer, but the right feelings are there. "
24,100,Initiated,Baki The Grappler,Providence,"There’s a thin line between charming confidence and obnoxious narcissism. People just
get used to your elitist comments. Someone could call you a friend, even if you casually
belittle the skills they’ve devoted their life to, as long as you’re an otherwise good friend.
Even works on strangers, but to a much lesser extent."
25,100,Take the Fall ,Tekken,Providence,"Have you ever considered how common falling from high places can be?
Canyons, mountains, cliffs, helicopters… it would have pretty gruesome results if you were to fall
over one or be thrown of it by a relative. With this perk you won’t have to worry about any
consequences of such events anymore. No matter how high you are you will not be injured and
always able to survive the Fall, be it by luck, skill or both. Fall damage is essentially a nonissue for
you. "
26,100,Seen Weirder Things,Tekken,Providence," Isn’t it odd that no one seems to bat an eye at things like Bears fighting in
a human Tournament? Either everyone in the World of Tekken has been conditioned to accept
crazy… or it is this Perk. No matter what you look like you find that people will accept it and won’t
treat you differently for it. When people run from you screaming it will be because you killed their
family and not because you have a pair of horns."
27,100,Eye-Catching,Street Fighter,Providence,"Some look plain, some look plain bad, but those like you having stunning
features that draw looks and peeks from those you walk past. Upon purchase you gain well above
average good looks, being prettier or more handsome at your discretion.
 What's more, you can redistribute the effect of this perk at purchase to focus on and ""emphasize""
a single one of your features. Want those lovely thighs that make people see stars? How about those
guns that make people's jaws go slack when you flex? Then this is the perk for you! This perk may be
purchased multiple times to emphasize different body parts."
28,100,Seems Fine,Street Fighter,Providence,"If you stick around long enough you're gonna see some strange people.
Levitating Indian men with skull necklaces, fire truck red skinned beefcakes with bizarre hair, green
wild men that can barely speak and that's just the tip of the iceberg.
 Upon purchase, people will just accept you walking around in public and going about your daily
business as long as you act normal, even if you look really, really strange. You may get people double
taking or staring, but you might as well be someone with a really interesting hat or ridiculous good
looks with the amount of attention you get.
 This only helps as long as you behave normally, so displays of strange abilities may still make
people gawk or question you or run away, but looking like a costume contest grand champion won't.
Doesn't help if you're absurdly outside the realm of normal, such as a kaiju or lovecraftian
abomination."
29,100,Mysterious,Street Fighter,Providence,"Enigmatic, mysterious, people stop to stare and have no idea why. There's just
something strange, different about you, at least after you get your hands on this perk.
 Upon purchase, you gain an air of mystery that makes others curious and questioning about you,
like there's always another layer to your character or something buried further down that you're
hiding. You also become good at maintaining it.
 If you act up front and casual, then people just might be a bit curious about you. If you really go all
in on being mysterious, you may develop into a kind of small urban legend or have a profile in some
intelligence gathering agencies."
30,100,Hermit,Street Fighter,Providence,"Those who go into isolation in pursuit of spiritual growth often calm down and
develop in certain ways. Many even form respect for such disciplined individuals and look towards
them for guidance.
 This allows you to simulate that image to a degree, making you ""seem"" more worldly and wise
than you really are. Your advice is taken more easily, your words have more weight than they would
without the perk and you can really rock some robes and prayer beads.
 Long as you don't do anything to break this image, you'll appear to be someone of an enlightened
persuasion."
31,100,Street Justice,Street Fighter,Providence,"In many situations you might find yourself out of uniform. In times like those,
no one knows to trust you as someone to go too if something bad is happening, that you're there to
keep order and ""stop the bad guys.""
 Upon purchase, this allows you to just feel more trustworthy, like you have some kind of authority
even civilian clothing. While no one will know you're a cop or soldier or whatever you happen to be,
you can bet glances of hope will shoot your way if a woman's purse is stolen or a store is getting held
up. Unless you break the image, people will instinctively believe you to be ""the good guy."""
32,100,Patriot,Street Fighter,Providence,"There's a point where someone wanting to show off their patriotism just ends up
looking like a mockery of the concept they want to represent. So how does one show their love and
allegiance for their home without looking like a flag pants wearing, costume store reject?
 Upon purchase of this perk, you will always know where the line between ""passionate patriot"" and
""just too much"" lies, and how not to cross it. When fully embracing your country (or kingdom,
civilization, planet, etc.), you also produce an aura broadcasting your sincere love and patriotism,
leaving no doubt where your loyalties lie.
 Symbols of your patriotism become as resilient as the feelings you place in them, whether this
means clothing, tattoos or even hair style."
33,100,Unassuming,Street Fighter,Providence,"Do you remember those people who gather around to watch spontaneous street
fights? Of course not. How about your bank teller? The guy bagging your groceries? Probably not.
Sometimes the best way to go unnoticed is just acting like you belong.
 This perk grants the power and skills that allow you to make yourself look and act as forgettable as
possible. You can evade notice like a background character. You can be looked over as easily as a set
piece. This only helps as long as you act casual, attention grabbing acts like attacking people or
employing flashy techniques will still draw attention."
34,100,Professional,Street Fighter,Providence,"You've made a career out of kicking ass and getting your ass kicked. At the end of
the day though, this is your career, or at least the way of life you subscribe too. Something in the
way you carry yourself makes this abundantly clear too.
 This perk allows you to more easily come off as a respectable fighter that's hard to hold a grudge
against after a fight. You're a professional, people are far less likely to take things personally unless
you go out of your way to make it personal.
 So go ahead and fight, fight and win, again and again, with the knowledge that people won't have
any hard feelings for you after you do, since that's just what you do. People may be upset at the loss,
or an injury obtained from it, but it wasn't your fault, right?"
35,100,I'm Serious!,Street Fighter,Providence," It happens a lot you know. You've trained hard, you've become strong, you're
ready to fight with or against the best of the best and be the difference you want to see in the world.
Only, people don't let you ""because you're a schoolgirl"" or ""nobody can take you seriously in a bright
pink gi.""
 This perk allows you to change all that. In business, combat and other serious environments and
situations your treatment by others won't be based on your appearance or quirks, but on your
dedication and competence.
 So go ahead, walk into a business meeting in your pyjamas or sign up for that world tournament
while in the form of a ten year old. People may sigh or give you an odd look, but you'll be welcome
all the same if you're willing and able."
36,100,Clear Intentions,Street Fighter,Providence,": ""A man of few words."" ""Actions speak louder than words."" Not very
eloquent? Want to make it abundantly clear that you're best left alone so the flies don't keep
buzzing around your head? This is the repellent.
 Upon purchase, you gain the ability to broadcast your blood lust, killing intent and other negative
emotions in general to intimidate others and earn yourself a measure of solitude. A fantastic ability
for setting the mood or making weaklings you have no time for leave of their own volition."
37,100,Food Luck,Toriko,Providence,"Is the belief of the fortune one can have with ingredients and their daily lives, such as the chances of finding rare ingredients, surviving against nature, or the lucky one can have succeeding at a food related event."
38,100,A Hero’s Journey,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"All myths of legend began with humble first steps, so
that the journey may eventually lead the hero into greatness. Should you so desire it, destiny
will guide you to dangers and disasters you are capable of facing or solving, which may form the
stepping stones of a great quest should you choose to undertake it. Note, however, that
accepting a challenge will not guarantee you are prepared for it...you should choose your battles
wisely"
39,100,Steel My Hear,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"You have already walked into hell and emerged from it
victorious - no half-hearted, honey-tongued words will sway you! Attempts to manipulate your
emotions, whether from holding your loved ones hostage or seeking to compromise your own
sense of honor or morality (if any) will find your heart as hard as stone, with your emotions calm
and your mind still focused and clear."
40,100,Loyal Pegasus,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"The Saints are the guardians of both humanity and their
Goddess, Athena. Above all else, you must safeguard that which is precious to you and your
heart. When you are protecting someone or something of value to you (other than yourself), you
will find your skills and combat abilities just a little bit sharper in doing so. You are also more
effective at taking injury or damage in their place, though this does not guarantee your own
survival or ability to withstand said damage."
41,100,Unicorn's luck,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence,"The fate of the unicorn Saint may not be to shine on the front stage, but is no less important : to simply be there with the others is sometimes all they need to turn the tide. You share this trait, able to seemingly join any location just at the right time, as long as the delay or distance is not outright unfair given your capabilities. You’ll make it there and be there to help them."
42,100,Wolf's Bond,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence,"Not every Saint is a giant one man army. Bronze and Silver tie close bonds and work together efficiently, a strength of their own you now develop naturally : any comrades you have that do not already hate you will work along, growing rapidly into a well oiled machine that runs on friendship and brotherhood. The pack is tight and all the stronger for it."
43,100,Pegasus' Promises,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence," Making promises you probably can’t keep is one of Tenma’s flaws, but no one can ever blame him for not trying to with all he has. As well as you : any promise you make, to yourself or others, you find yourself constantly working toward it, even if just in a minor or indirect way. It’d take constant mental effort not to keep your word, or just renouncing entirely. But what’s Saint who doesn’t hold up his word ?"
44,100,Golem’s Role,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence,"What role, you may ask ? The Golem Specter didn’t even have a minor role, and that’s the point. Much like him, as long as it doesn't concern you specifically, it doesn’t at all. Allies and enemies will leave you to your thing most of the time unless they have a good reason to still do. As an example, you’ll get a free pass from being dragged into that taskforce they’re making, but if Pandora was to order ALL Specters a full assault you’d have to go there."
45,100,Harpy’s Rank,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence,"The hierarchy of Specters is… well, there is Pandora, then the Three Judges, then the rest, so authority inside the “rest” is sometimes a pain and counterproductive. Not you though. Not only do you always have some form of authority or respect if you have greater power than those in front of you, your superiors tend to notice your true abilities and “promote” you accordingly, much like Happy Valentine belong to the four elites of Radamanthys because he equal Gold Saints and is loyal to the death."
46,100,Cool Monologing,Saint Seiya Omega,Providence,"In this and future worlds, monologuing is not merely a theatrical trope but a
powerful tool wielded by individuals to convey their ideals and explain the inner
workings of their techniques. No matter how cringe-worthy or grandiose one's
monologue may seem, the people of this and future world will take their and your
words seriously."
47,100,Good Looking,Saint Seiya Omega,Providence,"In this world where devotion to the gods is intertwined with physical
attractiveness, it seems fate has smiled upon you, granting you a visage that
ranks at least an 8 in the realm of looks. Whether by divine blessing or mere
coincidence, your appearance aligns with the standards upheld by those who
worship the gods, adding an extra layer of allure to my presence in this world."
48,100,Tactics Of The New Generations,Saint Seiya Omega,Providence,"In contrast to the past, where Saints prioritized one-on-one combat, you and the
new generation have embraced the importance of teamwork and collaboration.
Working together seamlessly, you and your allies move in perfect synchrony,
ensuring that your actions complement rather than hinder each other. This unity
and coordination among your group elevate your effectiveness on the battlefield."
49,100,False Camaraderie ,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"The Saints, despite the unified front they may put up towards enemies, have rarely been such a thing in truth. From mere personal clashes due to mutual dislike to hatred that stems from years old blood feuds, it's a mess of tangled friendships, rivalries, and enemies. But even with all that, you're still Saints. When the enemy comes to the door, you’ll be by each other's sides. You’re able to put aside any differences you have with someone and work together with them like they were a friend if you both fight. If they have a reason to work with you too, you can extend this effect to them as well so that both are efficient. Who knows? Maybe you’ll be able to work things out between the two of you as you fight together."
50,100,Egalitarianism,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"The stain of your family’s sins can mark you for life, no matter how unfair that fact might be. The crimes that those associated with you will no longer affect the way that people perceive you. Even if your entire family line has been known for treason, cowardice, and a lack of any good qualities, you will be judged entirely apart from them with not even an ounce of guilt assumed before you prove it to be so. Even if you look like someone, rather than just being associated with them through family or friend ties, you won’t be wrongfully blamed."
51,100,Man of the World,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"Just because you’re serving a Greek Goddess, there’s no reason to not seek out a properly varied education, especially when you’ll be regularly sent around the planet on your duties or even beyond. You’re able to speak dozens of different languages from around the world, can flawlessly act as the member of just as many varied cultures and can survive and live in most countries on earth with ease, whether that be in civilised society or in the wilds."
52,100,From the UN,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"A calm heart and soothing words can often solve the problems that all the power in the world cannot. You’re an expert negotiator, with long years of experience dealing with talking down all sorts of feuding nations, would-be world conquerors, and other madmen. You’re also amazing at reading people and, within the first hours, you’re talking to and getting to know the good and the bad in the people you’re talking to, then working with them to open up to you. Coming to understand these people and getting them to understand your perspective is what you excel at and managing to reach that understanding can solve conflicts before they even begin."
53,100,My Pride Will Do The Talking,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"The Gods should rule above all, why would you ever doubt that? More importantly, why ever bother even listening to the arguments of others as to why it should not be? No matter what they use, you are unable to be swayed from any opinion or belief that you hold. This is not protection against being mind-controlled, just against any effect or charm or persuasion that might seek to change your mind about specific things. You also happen to be just fantastic about giving any kind of monologue or self-aggrandising speech. Just come up with them on the spot."
54,100,Royalty,Feng Shen Ji,Providence,"You have an air of authority about you. Besides being an appearance booster (be an average 9/10) you will find yourself often getting opportunities to lead others, with people seeming to trust you (probably more than they should). Expect to be the first name to come to mind when people need work done or to give direction to a group. Can be toggled on/off at will."
55,100,Soothsayer,Feng Shen Ji,Providence,"Your words are laced with honey, able to numb those who listen long enough to heed your directions. The longer you talk with someone, the more they seem to understand your point of view (even if it's bull). Perfect for negotiating terms or proposing your enemies to surrender to superior forces. Though if whoever you are talking to was never going to listen to you in the first place, or cannot even understand you, this perk has no effect.
"
56,100, Omae wa mou shindeiru!,Fist Of The North Star,Providence,"Anything you have that causes instant or nigh-instant effects in a
foe now has a curious property. Once you use the technique, spell, or ability it will patiently wait to
take effect until after you've explained what is about to happen to your foe. Even better, your foe won't
take advantage of this time to try and take you with them, or counter your technique. They may run
screaming in terror though if you haven't paralyzed them or something."
57,100,The Stars Shine Upon Me,Fist Of The North Star,Providence,"Fortune favors you, you will find yourself crossing paths with
people you want to meet, your enemies will stumble through every guard you have before they reach
you, people with resources and skills will flock to your banner if you raise one, and other such minor
things will go your way. This does not guarantee the people you meet will be happy to see you. Nor
that your enemy won't kill all your guards and then crush you in a one on one duel. And it doesn't keep
the talented and influential people you pull towards you from realizing you are a terrible person and
leaving as quickly as they came. It merely gives you opportunities, but you must reach out and grasp
them with your own abilities."
58,100,Soul Protection,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Providence,"It is common for people to attack
each other’s Soul Realms, and a true master should know how to
guard it well. Now, you have little to no need for it anymore: your
Soul Realm is impossible to break while you are not
incapacitated.
This means your enemy needs to incapacitate you first before
damaging in any way your soul realm. This does not have any
drawbacks, such as making it impossible to cultivate a technique
that requires you to destroy your soul and reconstruct it; you will
find that you benefit completely from such techniques while not
needing to damage yourself. This also nullifies the dangers of
“over-cultivating”, cultivating so much that your soul threatens to
explode.
Taking a step further, you will not have any problems with demon
spirits inside your Soul Realm.
Post-Jump, this perk also covers any sort of metaphysical
construct bearing any semblance to Soul Realms and Souls."
59,100,Humble Presence,Reincarnator,Providence,"To other your presence in not threatening more like
normal compared to others, but this makes other people likely to ignore you unless
your are actively antagonizing them making them focus their attention to you, in
combat with large group of people monsters or people are likely to attack and focus
their attention to those around you."
60,100,See None do None,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Providence,"Sin in this world is a tangible thing,
and if enough of it is committed (mostly through the murder of non-cultivators), the Heavens
themselves will recognize your deeds and upon your tribulations, you would find them much
harder than what would otherwise be the case. Commit even more sinful deeds, and your very
appearance might even get tainted by the blinding light of Sin, letting everyone know who to target
for a gain in Karmic Merit. Screw all of that nonsense, you came here to party, and no way in hell
will some karmic scale for the supercomputer of the Universe ruin that! Because of this, you find
that people or other entities are generally unable to sense your Karma, or whether or not you lean
more towards Evil or Good, and even if they are able to do so, they won’t act on it. Directly seeing
you commit these deeds, however, will allow them to make a judgement about your general
disposition, and don’t expect someone to let you go if you have done something to affect them
personally"
61,100,Indignant Envoy,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Providence,"Sometimes being the errand boy is both a
frustrating and dangerous job: frustrating in that people like to just stop and spend several minutes
talking to you before you can leave, and dangerous in the fact that at any time these same people
can choose to kill you. Not anymore, however! Whenever you’re sent as an envoy to some
powerful figure, or meet with one in general, you’ll find that unless you truly offend them (say, by
killing their prized Grandson, or hitting a particularly sore spot), you’ll generally find them
completely fine with just ignoring it and moving on. The best perks of such a cozy job without the
danger!"
62,100,Living off the Land,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Providence,"There is a variety of environments and lands throughout the Endless Territories, thus it may seem
daunting to gain the amount needed for the cost of living, especially when currencies can change.
After all, the cost of a single Inn could eclipse the treasures of most of the strongest Daofathers
in the Three Realms. There’s a strange effect when it comes to you however, that being you
never really exert yourself to find the minimum amount of money required to live somewhere.
Whether through small lucky instances or a character traits of yours, you can always find

yourself living in a city away from the danger of the outside."
63,100,Call me Darknorth,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Providence,"Seems like you really have a catchy name, when you perform feats worthy of fame your name
sticks around far more than it should, spreading faster than communication can allow. This
always leaves you with the ability to intimidate others with reputation alone, assuming it isn’t

anything too important."
64,100,A Majestic Visage,Avesta of Black and White,Providence,"Befitting of the heroes of good, you have an inherent presence that brings calmness and
reverence from others. From the way you move, to way you dress yourself, and even the tone of
your voice, everything speaks of greatness. You have an easy time lifting people’s mood, and
even if you treat them coldly, they cannot help but feel impressed by your display of might.
What’s more, you find that neither old age nor other alignments can’t really taint this aura."
65,100,Shaped Like A Fortress,Avesta of Black and White,Providence,"There is something about your thought pattern that makes it really hard for others to get a read
on you, and even those who could peer into your thoughts cannot get a good grasp of you. It
may be how well-ordered your mind is, not allowing any unwanted thought to pass through, or
how used you are to lies that you can even lie in your own thoughts to conceal your true
intentions deep within yourself."
66,100,In The Blood,Campione,Providence,"Eugenics, baby. Blood ties are important for a reason and now you have control over it. You can choose any of your traits, powers or gifts to become a sure pass down to all your blood descendants. It could be your miko gift, your magic reserves or even some natural predisposition or talent you may possess. Whatever it is, it will become a trait carried over all your blood-related descendants."
67,100,I Know a Lady,Bleach,Providence,"When you’ve only got a little life to live, there’s a lot more passion to be found. Those with an
interest in your side, male or female, tend to find you really quite charming. You’ve always been sly
with such people, women or men as suits their tastes, and particularly for you are those older than
yourself. Despite likely being inexperienced and naive, you have no problems with seducing those
that might have decades on yourself. To them, you seem as mature and suave as someone many
times your actual age, they just can’t help but find you attractive. "
68,100,Undercover Humans,Bleach,Providence,"We all look pretty similar, past a certain point. Since everyone was originally human, they all
eventually take on or retain a human appearance, even the Hollows. It probably doesn’t help that
every race likes to wear a single uniform to tell each other apart. You’re able to take advantage of it
though, with your talent for disguising yourself as both a non-threatening civilian and a member of
other factions. Just by slipping on a different outfit, you can probably fool the rank and file of the
Shinigami or Quincy. Add in a hair shake or a few minor adjustments and even people that know you
might take a few minutes for recognition. People tend to forget to check their Reiatsu sense around
you, unless they’re actually pretty important or strong themselves."
69,100,Mubon-MUJIN!,The God of High School Jump,Providence,"Not everyone is given a cool or even a normal name by their parents. Sometimes they decide to name you Mubong or Man Duk and all you can do is put up with the jeers and jibes of those around you. You might change your name but people always remember...until you picked this up. Now you can change your name, any of your names, to something else at will. It won’t just change it socially but everything to do with that name changes to. Any legal forms will have been written in that name for example. If you want it to have always been that way, everyone will remember your name as what you changed it to but if not, they might forget to say it the new way every now and then. You can always change it again if you’re feeling a new handle."
70,100,Deities Among Mortals,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Providence,"We, Ōtsutsuki, are basically gods among the
mortals and this is a truth that these other lower lifeforms must believe, even if we
aren’t truly deities. You have a talent in convincing those greatly weaker than you
that you’re a divine being, through showing them your power and abilities. You can
literally start a cult around yourself if you like these things or just convince some
people to become your loyal worshipers."
71,100,Hypercompetent ‘Secretary’,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Providence,"Someone needs to take proper care of these foolish humans! But oh there are so many things that need to be done and subjects to cover. Fortunately you have a particular set of skills to do just that. On one hand you are a marketing genius, industry, negotiations, sales and of course assistant and secretary work coming to you naturally. If you put the work in it is not unlikely for you to create and lead a very successful company one day. On the other you are the kind to take a more hands on approach, as skilled as NFF’s top operator in terms of infiltration and stealth. This also comes with a certain amount of ‘appeal’, making you as beautiful as the fairest of vixens. Who wouldn’t want to employ you ♡?"
72,100,Wolf Mothered,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Providence,"Many have heard the tales that you were raised by beasts in the wild, like the glorious ancestor
Romulus and his brother Remus. It’s quite true as well, since you called a large pack of wild animals
your family for your early years before you left for civilisation. They might have been a pack of
wolves, a herd of deer or even a swarm of spiders, but they had unnatural intelligence and taught
you to channel certain powers of nature as well. You have a natural affinity for all animals given your
upbringing but in regards to the specific type that raised you, you can speak to them as if they were
humans and have them respond, teach them to retain that human intelligence and speech with
others and even command your animals to act in your service, though powerful kinds may resist. "
73,100,Looker,Chrome Shelled Regios,Providence,"So many people here are good looking individuals. You now may choose an appearance to have and as long as your species is capable of it you will always look like it. Your appearance never deteriorates regardless of lack of exercise or food, as long as you consume enough calories to prevent malnourishment. Any injuries will fully heal without scarring, as long as you can heal that wound. Your hair and teeth will always be perfect no matter the situation you are in and regrow if lost."
74,100,I am Looking for an Apprentice,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"Once you have created your legacy it will eventually become necessary to spread it to ensure that it does not die out or simply to ensure that your successors are as strong as you. Sometimes however, it is difficult to find talented and worthy apprentices. This perk allows you to easily find incredibly talented apprentices and allows you to naturally attract them based on your reputation. The final boon you receive by taking this is that their loyalty is ensured. Unfortunately it is relatively common for disciples in these worlds to betray and even kill their masters to obtain their power. This perk will ensure that this will never happen and that your students will be truly loyal and grateful to you. "
75,100,I Seduce People With My Own Ability,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"There is a difference between having good looks and seductive looks. This perk grants you a seductive aspect to your appearance. Before you may have earned a look or two, but with this you will actively enthrall those who are attracted to you. In addition you shall be granted one other boon. A consequence of attracting so much attention is the jealousy of others. Both from their own inadequacies and the attention from those that they admire. This will reduce the hatred you gather significantly. Granted if you steal someone’s wife they will still be angry, but now they won’t care if their wife is openly staring at you.
"
76,100,"You Kidnapped My Daughter
",Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"Similar to how the Netherking accidentally ended up with Zi Yun as a follower, you are able to gather tag alongs with ease. You will run into various individuals who are more than willing to join you wherever you are going. In addition these individuals will typically have a special background. For example, Zi Yun was the daughter of the Amethyst Elder. A final bonus is that you will be far less likely to deal with negative consequences from their company. Meaning a parent or boss will be less likely to be angry at you. 

"
77,100,Cultivators and Noodle Shops,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"Whenever Cultivators of different groups gather at a restaurant, fights tend
to happen. When you are around, all the more so. Still, as long as you don’t
join in you can safely watch. If you wish, this trend will continue in future
worlds, with powered individuals substituting for Cultivators if they are not
present in a setting."
78,100,Obligatory Appearance Booster,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"While Cultivating naturally improves your appearance, there are those who
are innately blessed. For 100 CP you can be up to the standards of the
Azure Hills Cultivators even before you become one yourself. For an
additional 100 you can have some real Xiulans and even Cultivators
multiple Realms up would take note of your appearance. This may or may
not be a good thing depending on how you handle it. This also optionally
comes with really cute freckles."
79,100,Underdog,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"Worthless. That is what most Cultivators and Nobles think of when it comes
to the poor gutter rats that cling to life in the underbelly of the more
prominent cities. Such a thing can be infuriating, but it’s also useful, as it
means they never really put any effort into dealing with them. Something
you might want to get good at exploiting, as no matter where you go you
tend to get underestimated a lot."
80,100,Can’t Read My,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"You got one hell of a poker face. You could be having a mind shattering
meltdown while appearing outwardly as perfectly composed and well
mannered to the extent even the Cloudy Sword Sect would be impressed.
This is also somehow genetic, meaning your kids will be equally as good at
containing their inner freakouts behind a face of serenity."
81,100,Wise Heavenly Scholar’s Naming Skills,Against The Gods,Providence,"It’s always a hit or miss with Xianxia names, and
it’s no exception in this world. A name can be awesome or it can be completely dumb. On one end
you can have something like a ‘Blue Wind Empire’, on the other you can have something as metal as
the ‘Golden Crow’s Record of the Burning World’. You are above such things, however.
Not only are whatever names you decide to give something accepted without question by even the
most irreverent people, they invoke exactly the kind of feelings you want them to invoke, regardless
of their actual nature."
82,100,Merely an Unsouled,Cradle,Providence,"You're underestimated. By Everyone. Maybe it's the way you
carry yourself, or perhaps you're simply good at hiding how good you are. Whatever the reason,
you'll find that your first fight against someone will usually catch them off-guard. The trick rarely
works twice though."
83,100,Linguistic Larceny,Cradle,Providence,"By default, you'll find yourself communicating in your native
tongue and everyone else in your Jumps just understands that. This, however, takes it one step
further, now you can quickly adapt to slang terms, accent, etc, to match your environments. All it
takes is a quick conversation with someone to attune yourself to a new locale."
84,100,Combat Beauty,Cradle,Providence,"Scars you obtain will never heal ""badly"", and always tend towards
the attractive or ""cool"" side of things. Even if you're somehow covered in hundreds of small
lacerations, it makes you look like a badass instead of a freak."
85,100,Unexpected,Cradle,Providence,"Frankly, you're just plain eccentric. Difficult to predict, thinking odd
thoughts, alternative solutions to a problem come as easy as breathing, and somehow your
enemies -and your allies- never see it coming."
86,100,NPC Behavior,World Seed,Providence,"With all the life changing events about to happen in a few years, it really wouldn’t be a surprise if
people started freaking out and going apeshit. I mean, if the moon suddenly decides it had
enough of Earth and dances away, could you really blame them? But as you’ll soon experience,
people here seem strangely calm about whatever happens in their lives. And now you’ll take this
exact quality with you, even infecting other people with it if you want to. So what if the very
foundation of the universe changes one day, magic becomes real, and monsters killed your
neighbors? Ain’t nothing stopping you from continuing on with the job you’re being paid to do!
And since everyone will feel the same, you won’t even be accused of being a psychopath. This
works just as well for causing major changes in other worlds, such as introducing magic or
revealing the existence of actual Gods, with everyone being mostly fine with them as long as
your intentions aren’t obviously malicious."
87,100,Restrained Might,Dragon Ball,Providence,"When true experts clash their blows can sunder entire galaxies and in some cases even
whole universes. Thankfully most fighters at this level restrain themselves to prevent
excessive collateral damage. Having had this principle drilled into your head you have
learned to restrict the destructive effects of your abilities. This allows you to prevent
damage from your powers or any clash you’re involved in from spreading. For example,
if you fought above a city none of the shockwaves would impact the city below. As long
as you aren’t intentionally trying to destroy something it will not be harmed."
88,100,Focal Point of Reality,Dragon Ball,Providence,"There are many wide scale disasters such as the universe deletions that result in
countless deaths. More often than not individuals have to rely on luck to survive these
instances. Luckily, you don’t have to as you are seemingly protected in these situations.
You cannot be directly killed, erased, or otherwise removed by any broad action. Some
examples include Zeno erasing a universe, a country wide blast being shot near you, or
the destruction of a planet you’re on. This perk however becomes significantly less
effective if an attack is deliberately focused on you. You might still possess a degree of
resistance, but it would only give you a few moments to act."
89,100,Strength is Sexy,Dragon Ball,Providence,"Saiyan hierarchy is based on strength above all else. This also means that the stronger
someone is, the more attractive a mate they are considered. You are an embodiment of
this concept. The stronger you are the more you attract those around you. This effect is
particularly effective on warriors and combatants that you are attracted to. This effect
will also grow more potent as you grow in strength. For example, if you're strong enough
you would gain the desires of numerous individuals even if you didn’t intentionally try to.
Lastly, this also ensures that any mates or lovers you gain will be comfortably sharing
you. Though they will likely impose some standards on who can join them if you allow it."
90,100,Unstoppable Evolution,Dragon Ball,Providence,"One of the most notable tropes in Dragon Ball is that everyone will allow each other to
power up. Logically letting your foe transform is an asinine idea, but it is one that occurs
often. Thankfully this applies to you as well. Whenever you are powering up or
transforming it will be impossible for anyone to harm you. Perhaps they will wait
willingly, be blown away by your power, or otherwise stopped by the universe itself.
Lastly, this also ensures that all of your transformations look quite impressive and that
you gain the ability to yell extremely loudly while transforming."
91,100,The Endless Grind,Dragon Ball,Providence,"The most common reason that fighters stop growing weaker is that they are unable to
push themselves. Rather than going beyond your limits you have figured out an
alternative method. You have figured out how to suppress your skills and body to train
them at a higher intensity. For example, if you got used to training at 100 times gravity
you could suppress your body. This would allow you to benefit from the higher gravity
even after you got used to more intense levels. Most importantly this effect will allow
you to increase your peak limits rather than simply repeating your previous efforts."
92,100,Harmonious Genes,Dragon Ball,Providence,"You seem to be perfectly compatible with any other species.
You can safely produce or otherwise create healthy offspring with any being. Any
children born will be perfect hybrids or effectively new species. Lastly, this also gives
you an instinctive ability to understand other species, their customs, and how to attract
them if you wish to."
93,100,Filial Sons,Dragon Ball,Providence,"For one reason or another quite a few powerful individuals are terrible parents. A great
example of this is King Cold’s relationship with Frieza and Cooler. Luckily you somehow
managed to avoid falling into this group. In fact you are actually a wonderful parent
capable of inspiring unmatched loyalty in your creations. As a result your children and
creations will always be loyal to you. Meaning that you will never have to worry about
being overthrown or otherwise threatened by your spawn."
94,100,This is Mine Now,Dragon Ball,Providence,"There are a number of powers and positions which can be bestowed upon certain
individuals. This however, also means that these abilities can be taken away. Somehow
though you are capable of internalizing and absorbing any foreign boost you receive.
For example, if you were given strands of the Energy of Destruction you would have
started generating your own energy if they were taken away. As a result you will never
lose any powers or abilities given to you."
95,100,Respect,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"The best thing about being an elder is how rare it is for you to actually end up having to fight.
Word is out about your skill, and often the mere mention of a name is enough to avert fights
and battles alike.
Your myth is well spread in the lands around this world now, tales of your deeds in other
worlds, and entirely fictional accounts that nonetheless perfectly fit what you would be able to
do if you wanted. People know you, and they fear and respect you for good reason.
Even as you move through the ‘levels’ of this world, you find that you soon come to fit into
stories about previously unknown figures, granting you similar levels of respect and fear, while
scattering around accounts of your deeds in the world."
96,100,Cute As A Button,A Will Eternal,Providence,"You are extraordinarily attractive. The cultivation golden standard. While in a youthful form
this will translate into being mind-bogglingly adorable, in adult form this will even attract the
lustful gazes of men and women with iron hearts. Your sheer ethereal beauty will put other
cultivators to shame, people who already are innately attractive by virtue of cultivating. Of
course, such beauty can come with its own drawbacks, especially in settings like this."
97,100,What Handicap?,A Will Eternal,Providence,"Spiritual energy is not a constant. Some areas will have more than others, and conversely
some areas will be extremely sparse, like the Wildlands. If the amount of energy in the
environment is lacking, your body responds by taking in energy from a much larger radius.
Acting similar to a black hole, your body will pull as much as possible towards you, gulping it
in like a man dying of thirst. Why should your cultivation speed be any slower than those
silver spooned Heavenspan cultivators?"
98,100,Ever-Flowing Quiver,One finger Death Punch,Providence,"Arrows, throwing daggers, shuriken and similar ranged ammunition is plentiful, triple the expected
amount when scavenged from battlefields and opponents. Sometimes the only difficulty is getting
rid of the bounty you have on hand."
99,100,Improvised Weapon Understanding,Generic Exalted,Providence,"No weapon? No problem. Whenever you need it
you will always be able to find a nearby object you can use as a form of improvised weapon. It is
guaranteed to be a superior choice to using your bare hands, unless you’re using some sort of
explicitly bare-handed martial art style. Additionally you’ll never suffer from using improvised
weapons in this way as you somehow manage to make them, if not as good as a real weapon,
than at least serviceable as a means of protecting yourself."
100,100,"One Weapon, Many Hands",Generic Exalted,Providence,"- You are more than the sum of your parts. Any time you
fight, or just cooperate in general, with your peers and allies you all receive a boost to your
respective skills and abilities. Swordsmen become better with swords, able to twist and parry
and strike with a fluidity they could never reach on their own, scientists work off of one another
to make incredible insights and discovers, and craftsmen collaborate to make works of
surpassing quality that they could never have even dreamed of making by themselves. This is a
modest but noticeable boost for all individuals involved, but it particularly shines when in use
with other Dragon-blooded. In such a case their respective abilities are doubled, and the sheer
speed and efficiency of their collaborative works seem as if choreography."
101,100,Naturally Getting Your Way Maneuve,Generic Exalted,Providence,"You are Exalted above others, are you not? Of
course you are, and others can tell that this is the case. Even if they can’t actually tell you’re an
exalt, or even know what an exalt is. Something about you and your authority and natural
privilege will simply be apparent to them, and they will give considerably more weight to your
opinions and desires than they might show to others. Effectively you get the kind of
consideration a noble would receive, as opposed to that of a commoner, wherever you might
go."
102,100,Name That Unfolds Like Lotus Blossom,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"As you may have noticed, Creation and Malfeas both have an abundance of flowery and
impressive sounding title-names. Perhaps sometimes to a rather excessive degree. With
this, you'll be able to start carrying one of these, in case you've ever wanted to be called
something like the Whispering Petal Bodhisattva, the Maelstrom of Endless Fangs, the
Labyrinth of Seven Angles, or even the Bride of Sanguine Roses...
But as you could simply declare you wish to be called such here, this has another effect. You
will be taken completely serious, despite the ridiculousness and length of any names and
titles you introduce yourself by, both here and in other worlds. In fact, you might notice that
by doing so, people will actually tend to respect you a little more than someone with an
ordinary name."
103,100,Raiment of Death's Trappings,Abyssals Exalted,Providence,"To the Abyssals, the living essence of Creation is effervescent and cloying at the same time,
making their skin crawl. Direct sunlight compounds this nauseating discomfort.To overcome
these annoyances, most deathknights adopt the trappings of the dead and the Underworld
when they venture into Creation.
They wear funeral shrouds and adorn themselves with skulls and bones, whether actual
articles of bone or skeletal images in their clothing and jewelry. When they travel as heralds
for their Deathlords, they hire a train of mourners to follow and wail their misery. They dress
all in black or all in white. They sleep in coffins. They wear leather plague masks with cruel
beaks and staring crystal eyes. They cool themselves with folding fans made of bone and
human skin. Any affectation or adornment that would remind an onlooker of death, the
grave, the Great Contagion or the Abyss itself suffices. Such dreadful trappings help an
Abyssal to center themselves and align his Essence in a more comfortable way. They do not
allow him to respire Essence in Creation, but they do eliminate the annoying discomfort that
being in Creation inflicts on him.
Of course, adorning themselves with such paraphernalia of death can come across as trying
a bit too hard for some deathknights. However, this is unacceptable for the Moonshadow
Caste, as they must be the envoys and representatives of the Deathlords and the Neverborn
themselves. Accordingly, you have been blessed with a wraithly sense of style and morbid
presentation. Knowing exactly how to wear you funereal outfits, you will be a vision in black,
looking absolutely amazing when adorned with bone, funerary shroud, and other trappings.
But more than owning merely the gothic look, this will also aid you in adopting a properly
dark demeanor and yet still be taken serious, and even the elaborate titles of the Abyssal
Exalted will be given the trepidation and weight in the minds of onlookers they deserve, no
matter how long-winded or pretentious they might be."
104,100,Exquisite Ashen Visage or Wretched Abhorrent Mien,Abyssals Exalted,Providence,"The Black Exaltation leaves its mark on the flesh of the newly Exalted, and as an Abyssal’s
power and essence increases, so too does their appearance change. The deathknights tend
toward the very extremes of appearance. Some are beautiful, some hideous, and all have a
supernatural cast to their features. The beautiful might have ghostly white or gleaming ebon
faces and long silken hair of shadowy black, liquid red or metallic silver. Those with hideous
features might bear unearthly scars that look like weird glyphs, or their features might have
rotted away to leave mildewing muscle or exposed bone. Some hideous Abyssals hide their
unpleasant features behind the shadows of a cowl, wrap them in long bandages, cover them
with tight leather masks or encase themselves permanently in armor.
But even amongst the exquisite allure, and horrific hideousness, of the Abyssal Exalted, you
stand apart from the others as the finest of examples of these extremes. You might be so
beautiful as to shame even the most charming of your fellows and the most elegant
courtesans of the Underworld. Or you might be so hideously ravaged and disfigured that

even other deathknights step back in fright at your revealed visage, amplifying the impact of
your threats and intimidation."
105,100,Bafflingly Likeable,Mushoku Tensei,Providence,"Oddly enough you are quite likeable to everyone even with your constant perverted laughter, groping, and
innuendo can’t seem to turn people off. While your charm affects everyone, it is particularly strong with the
elite and powerful, either politically or otherwise, as they focus on your strong and positive traits more than the
negative ones. Simply being around people for a long time would cause them to lower their guards and invite
you into their factions and family. Everyone you meet will at least treat you as a guest and would not be hostile
unless they were already hostile and intended to harm you."
106,100,Natural Attractiveness,Mushoku Tensei,Providence,"Like many people in this world who are beautiful or handsome, it would be embarrassing if you are left being
ugly. This perk improves your appearance to the point that you would rank in the top percentile of the world in
terms of attractiveness. Even when covered with dirt and wearing the worst fashion you still look good
compared to most people. You even make scars look appealing."
107,200,Friend Lure,UQ Holder,Providence,"Even complete strangers can’t resist wanting to get to know you with the kind of smile that’s on your face. You find it quite effortless to make friends, even when you’ve just walked up to a stranger out of the blue, and those fast friendships will rapidly grow stronger as long as you keep spending time together. You’re just that innately likable kind of person that others like to be around. Even your enemies might find themselves enjoying a fight with you, though don’t expect this alone to get them to be merciful."
108,200,Power of a Human Girl,UQ Holder,Providence,"It’s something immortals often forget. To get who you want, you gotta go after them. When you have someone you’re romantically interested in, the act of pursuing them in romance will slowly get them more and more interested in you. They’ll notice the good traits you have, find that they don’t mind your flaws, and maybe even just like the idea of being with you. The more opposed someone is to you, the longer this will take, but with dedication, no one is beyond the reach of love."
109,200,Breaking Bonds For Bonds,UQ Holder,Providence,"When someone you love is in danger, there’s no helping the desire to be there to protect them. Maybe you can’t protect them on your own, but you’ll at least be able to have the chance. Whenever you are bound or restricted in some way, such as being wrapped in chains or held down with a magic gravity spell, you have a chance to break this just through the force of your love for someone else that is in danger. Even a spell from someone much stronger can be broken through in an instant if someone you truly love is in danger, though the love for a friend might work a bit less effectively. Even something like a jail cell could bust open if needed.
"
110,200,Mouse Trick,UQ Holder,Providence,"When an immortal is found out for what they are, it usually means it’s time to skip town and move on to some place that isn’t familiar with you. With how obsessed some people can get about your kind, you’ll want something to shake them off your trail. This perk gives you the ability to easily shake anyone from following or hunting you down, even when they use magic. So long as you are actually making an escape from areas they are directly present in, you’ll almost always be able to lose them. Even a master mage wouldn’t be able to locate you, unless you’re right under his nose on purpose. If you start drawing attention and acting out again without trying to hide, you’ll lose the protection for a while.
"
111,200,Brightest Star,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Get enough power, and people will look up to you. Doesn’t matter who, or why, but you can use this to your advantage. You, at will, may start glowing a bright white light, and allies within the light are motivated and moralized, while enemies in it are demoralized."
112,200,The Wise,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"There must be something special about you, because people seem to look up to you. They seem to take your sayings as wise teachings, and they tend to ignore your shortcomings, saying they are flawed. Doesn’t help against someone if they already hate you, but it's a start."
113,200,Tiger’s Blood,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Looks can get you far in the Throne. Some mercenaries, assassins, and general killers are hired just for having an imposing figure. Like them, you look pretty threatening. While I’ll leave the specifics to you, you generally have an aura of “don’t fuck with me” around you. Just try to have strength to back up your looks."
114,200,Common Sense,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"You actually have some sanity, after all. You see through people’s lies, at least the less complex ones, and you know when you are being manipulated."
115,200,Het Transforms into a Pillar of Basalt,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Maybe someone threatens you, or thought they could get away with what they were doing, or maybe they looked at you the wrong way. Regardless, by focusing on someone, they seem to do less damage toward you. While simple, it can be useful in some circumstances."
116,200,Live Another Day,"A Cultivator's Beginning",Providence,"Blades are turned aside at the last moment, arrows barely miss you, and you can't recall the last time your drink was poisoned, or assassins tried to kill you in your sleep. Any accidents or runs of bad luck never seem to cause you significant injury let alone threaten your life.

In short, you are much more fortunate than most when it comes to matters of life and death."
117,200,Brainwashing,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Providence,"Through repeated nagging discussion you are able to convince
former enemies and reluctant allies to be your friends. While it must be spread out over a period
of days and they must be at least willing to talk with you, with enough effort and persistence you
can convince anyone or anything to be a part of your legion of minions family. Even without
actively pursuing these pawns friendships, you will still be able to build up a stauch band of
tolerant loyal followers through simple daily interaction and short conversations. While these
people are not suicidal or extraordinarily skilled, they will generally be competent at their
assigned tasks and will do most of whatever you ask.
"
118,200,"It’s Too Bright",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"Word of you spreads fast. Even if there were hardly any witnesses to your most impressive feats, somehow word will spread around. For 100cp, you can quickly become an urban legend, with just enough details wrong to protect your privacy, but enough right for you to take credit for it later. If you pay 200cp instead, your legend could spread globally, potentially making you an object of reverence across cultures. You may even find vague prophecies of your glory."
119,200,The Gods Saw Fit to Grace me With a Spare,Baki The Grappler,Providence,"Lost an eye? An arm? A lung? You still have one more don’t you? Losing a body part
doesn’t impede you nearly as much as it should, especially if you have multiple. Losing an
eye will have a minimal effect on your depth perception, just as losing a leg will barely
affect your balance. You’re fighting style instantly adapts to the changes in your balance
and body, even if the injury was mere seconds ago. "
120,200,"Playmates, Opponents, & Prey",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"A beast is at their strongest when starving. Rather than fatiguing your body, the craving
makes you movement and senses sharper than ever, though it still impedes your rational
thinking somewhat. When your body feels like it reached its limit, the presence of food
can let you tap into deep stores of strength and energy you didn’t know you had."
121,200,"The Kindest Game in the World",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"Some fight for themselves, some for those they hold dear. For those you who love you,
your displays of affection can push them to grow as a fighter by leaps and bounds,
transcending their original limits. This could be expressed through sexual interactions, but
what matters most is the feelings, so cuddling and the like may work just as well. "
122,200,"Is 10 Seconds Long?",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"Like a runner, your true might is best shown in spurts, rather than drawn-out conflicts.
This is only a brief range, about 10 seconds, within a couple meters of yourself, but within
that compressed time and space, you can exert over 100% of your power. Even in daily
life, you instinctively sense anything that gets within this 2-meter range –"
123,200,"“Hitting Resolve” & “Resolve to be Hit”",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"A rakish who’s ready to be hit will never fall. You can take just about any attack head-on
if you know to expect it. Taking hardly any physical or psychological damage unless the
enemies power dwarfs your power several times over. You can even resist esoteric
techniques like Aiki that seize control of your body through pure effort. "
124,200,Born Leader ,Tekken,Providence,"No man is an Island. You might need help in whatever challenges find you in these
Jumps. Fortunately help won’t be too far away. This perk turns you into an excellent leader on par
with Lars Alexanderson. Men will follow you without doubt in their hearts into Fights and your
strategies will always show at least some success."
125,200,Brothers in Arms ,Street Fighter,Providence,"There's a special bond that develops on the battlefield between allies. When
any moment could be your last, stuff like age, gender, roles, differences in opinion, none of that
matters as much as everyone going home. That's the ideal anyways.
 This perk aids in building strong bonds with those you regularly train with, work with and fight
beside. From the rookie to the veteran, students and teachers, commanding officers and grunts, all
will become closer over time. Long as you're working for the same thing, honest in your intentions,
this kind of loyalty will form."
126,200,Tag Team,Street Fighter,Providence,"Not as uncommon as you would think, sometimes a fight has multiple parties on
both sides. It's not the same as single combat, you can't just go out with everything you got and let it
hang out. You're experienced enough to know that by now.
 Upon purchase, your ability to work with allies vastly improves, whether you have a history of
working alongside them or not. Tapping into their rhythm, matching their pace, or conversely,
bringing them into your own groove.
 Act as a unit instead of individuals; dance together in harmony; beat the enemy's face in as a team
and triumph! "
127,200,Competitive Surge,Street Fighter,Providence,"Rivalry can be the source of numerous feelings, enmity, friendship,
ambition, drive to overcome. It's the sense of competition that comes from having a peer working
toward the same goal against you that aids in the growth of many.
 This perk improves your personal growth when training alongside of, or competing with, someone
of the same general power or skill level. In other words, a competent rival. Training will progress
more smoothly, breakthroughs come more often and so on.
 What's more, if this is a friendly rivalry you find yourself in, the effects will somewhat extend to
them as well, allowing the two of you to compete on the same level for longer until one or the other
overcomes."
128,200,Disciplined Restraint,Street Fighter,Providence,"Your full power is something glorious to behold that you don't wish to
waste on weaklings, or perhaps it is a curse that's too hard to control for your liking. Whatever the
case may be, you have abilities that you wish to hold back, and this is the perk for you.
 Upon purchase, you gain the ability to suppress or even completely seal your own powers. This
can allow you to limit yourself to a fraction of your normal power, or block off a specific ability that
doesn't normally have an off switch and more.
 Removing a limiter is as easy as applying it, which is itself a simple task of willing it so. Something
you need to keep in mind though is while this perk can suppress specific abilities, it cannot suppress
specific 'parts' of an ability. You either restrain the whole thing or not at all."
129,200,Beast Tamer,Toriko,Providence,"Some people are great with animals. You are even better. Forget Horse Whisperer, you can just carry on conversations with any kind of animal and they might just sit there and listen. 
Your skill with animals is great enough to tame nearly every animal in the Human World and with some effort even those in the Gourmet World.
You gain the skills needed to properly care for, train and ride most any kind of animal.
"
130,200,Organization Trust,Toriko,Providence,"You gain the feeling in regard to whether an organization could be trusted by Jumper standards.  Also an organization(s) led by Jumper, not only will be more streamlined in regard to their management and function, but also will have an easier time in gaining trust themself. 
"
131,200,Underworld Connections,Toriko,Providence, That Perk allows for easier time for forming less than lawfull connections with criminal organizations. It also helps gain a better reputation with them.
132,200,Plucky Unicorn,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"Okay, let’s be honest here. The battles in this world
are between heroes who can shatter planets and moons like glass, and things only go up from
there. It can be a little daunting for a simple, modest hero! Not to worry, you have a way to
practically guarantee your survival...you just need to lose. Badly. When overwhelmed by a
superior foe, they are liable to stop short of actually killing you, sparing you and forgetting all
about you shortly afterwards. So long as you make no attempt to resume the fight, you’re free to
live and let live...assuming that they aren’t after you personally, or that you didn’t already try this
on them once before. Throwing this fight doesn’t have to necessarily be genuine or needing you
to fight at your fullest - but it must be convincing and appear humiliating to those watching you."
133,200,Paid My Dues,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"The toll to join the deceased in the Underworld is a
fine all must pay eventually. You’ve paid yours in advance, by virtue of being a Specter of
Hades. Beings in charge of death or the afterlife will look upon you with respect, treating you the
same way they would a fellow employee or an honored guest. After your chain ends, whenever
you end up passing from this world forever, your soul will be ferried to any afterlife of your
choosing...whether empty oblivion or a utopian heaven, that choice is in your hands."
134,200,Deadly Beetle’s Ground,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence,"This war has seen a lot of attackers, but you didn’t forget that to do so they have to put faith in the defenders behind them, and faith in you they have. Gates, passages, prisoners, wherever or whoever you are tasked to protect, you have the skills and luck so that any invader will find itself unable to go past you physically, not without a solid plan, overwhelming number, or esoteric methods like teleportation.
"
135,200,Loved,Saint Seiya Omega,Providence,"Much like the beloved Goddess Pallas herself, you exude an irresistible charm
and adorableness that endears you to others effortlessly. Your innate charisma
and warmth make it effortless for you to garner affection and loyalty from those
around you, drawing people towards you with ease. This charm extends beyond
mere likability, granting you the ability to forge deep connections and recruit
powerful allies to your cause"
136,200,Forged in Fire,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"Putting aside your differences is the first thing but you’ll only become a true team when you become true companions, even outside of the fight. It’s something you find quite easy to do as you naturally befriend any people you work alongside with over time. The less friendly the person you’re working alongside, the longer this will take but even a rather churlish young man shouldn’t take more than a few weeks of daily cooperation to start to come around to you. The more dangerous the work you share, the faster this will happen too. The average work of a Saint can get pretty darn dangerous too."
137,200,Saint of Holidays,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"Sure, being a Saint is an important job and shirking your duties like this does technically make you a deserter but... people seem to find you valuable enough to excuse your absences, so long as you don’t make them suspect you were doing it to sabotage them or help the enemy. Whenever you shirk some duty or responsibility assigned to you, people will just accept that you couldn’t come and not place any blame onto you for your absence. If you’ve agreed to do something or go somewhere at a set time, this won’t help, but so long as it’s just your general expectations, you can get out of even events that hold the fate of millions of people in the balance."
138,200,Come Back In A Few Years,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"Everyone loves a good fight. Or at least they really should, especially if they're up to fighting someone on your level. It seems that, so long as you're not at some climactic battle, you'll find your fighting counterparts to be surprisingly merciful towards you. If you've given your foe a good fight or even just entertained them for a while, you'll usually be allowed to run off unpursued by them personally and sometimes even not pursued by the other enemy forces. Do it too many times and they'll probably decide to put you down for good but the hope of another fun fight gets you out of trouble a fair few times. If you came close to killing them, they're probably just going to end you though. They'd like a fun fight but they're not stupid. Not unless they already were."
139,200,The Lion is a Fool,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"An enemy or an obstacle until you turn them into an advantage. Much as they might like to think they're opposing you, that's only true until you work them into a benefit for yourself. You're turning foes, real or political, on each other or anticipating the actions your enemies will take but also managing to spin it so that either way you gain. You can take advantage of the actions they'll make, twisting their words and turning their allies. It doesn't even need to be something of really screwing with their morale once they’ve realized they've been playing into your hands all along."
140,200,Delusional Bluster,Feng Shen Ji,Providence,"Some may say “speak softly and carry a big stick” as their policy. You completely ignore that and follow “speak LOUDLY and carry an EVEN BIGGER STICK”! There is no way to ignore you with your boisterous voice. You can speak with such confidence that even your falsehoods sound as true as any of your other claims. And even when you're caught within your misleading tales, you can just admonish the foolish listeners for their incompetence for letting you lead them by the nose in the first place. Thus  your lying and ‘fine’ skills of manipulation are top notch, as long as you speak at the loudest volume!
"
141,200,Make Do,Feng Shen Ji,Providence,"Being a denizen of the Underworld, you had to be pretty resourceful with what limited supplies you would be able to uncover. This perk lets you put this into practice, stretching materials needed for crafting, cooking, logistics, repairs, engineering projects, magic rituals, construction labor...anything that needs a hard set number is now reduced by half for the required material or labor to complete such an activity. Though using the normal required material for a project will see its effectiveness doubled (both for the work and the finished product)."
142,200,Wisdom for the Ages ,Feng Shen Ji,Providence,"The Gods have been ruling the world for hundreds of millenia, they have amassed a wide collection of knowledge; apparently Tian even knows a little genetic engineering or at least knows the better part of artificial selection in order to guide the evolution of apes into Humans. You may choose one of the two branches of natural science to receive an equivalent to a master's degree of, with all current subjects involved with this field - Physical Science, sciences that investigate non-living systems like physics, chemistry, earth science, geology, oceanography, astronomy, etc..; and Life Sciences deals with studying living systems like biology, ecology, botany, zoology, virology, microbiology, biochemistry, meteorology, etc.... Knowledge updates in further Jumps. Can be taken multiple times. "
143,200,Fateless,Fist Of The North Star,Providence,"You are just another poor soul trying to get by, unlike practitioners of mighty arts
and those whose souls are bound to fate no destiny chains you. You may not be fated to be great, but
that doesn't mean you can't make something of yourself anyway. Besides, a nobody like you doesn't
have to worry about the stars deciding his fate. When someone tells you something like ""The Star of
Death shines over your head."" you can just shrug it off and do whatever you want anyway without
worry."
144,200,Synergy,Reincarnator,Providence,"You have learned something very useful, the power of working in
a group, you can now fight alongside others without getting in their way and always
contribute your piece for success, while you are in a group everyone will share this
powerful ability, making you a valuable member of any group."
145,200,Underestimated,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Providence,"“Puny Houtian Stage”, “Puny
Zifu Disciple”, “Puny Wanxiang Adept”, “Puny Void Immortal”, “Puny Celestial Immortal”:
These are all words that have been uttered near endlessly across the Three Realms and beyond.
Arrogance is a trait that is bred true in almost every single being in this vast cosmos, and even
beings who would otherwise be more cautious still fall victim to such vices. However, whenever
you are involved, everyone seems to just completely ignore any possibility of you posing any kind
of a threat, completely disregarding you unless you don’t wish them to, or you’re a level or two
higher than them."
146,200,New Frontiers,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Providence,"As said above, there is an insane amount of Variety in the environments of the Endless
Territories. It’s not just a matter of Entire planets made of certain materials, but some of the laws
of Physics could be completely flipped. Good thing you have the ability to navigate your way
through these diverse environments without much issue as long as they don’t contain threats that
surpass you in strength. Even if a world has no such thing as Gravity, you’ll still be capable of

living and operating there as if you had done so your entire life."
147,200,A Strong Bond,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Providence,"Unlike in a Xianxia Novel, meeting new people in real life doesn’t mean they suddenly consider
you a good acquaintance simply because you weren’t a dick. Good thing for you, this IS a
Xianxia Novel, meaning that even new acquaintances will be willing to make small sacrifices to
help you out if they come across you. They won’t risk their lives, but they won’t mind helping
you out in a pinch or loaning some things. Making friends with these people is even easier than it

should be too."
148,200,Just Like A Visual Novel,Avesta of Black and White,Providence,"It shouldn’t be that kind of story, but it seems that you have a tendency to surround yourself with
attractive members of the opposite gender. They don’t need to be your allies, but it seems that
they often find one reason or another to gain a certain interest in you. Whatever you use this
interest for, it’s up to you."
149,200,Dark Master,Avesta of Black and White,Providence,"Befitting of a powerful evil lord, you have the makings of a true harem master. Not only are you
an expert seducer, a master of all the bodily pleasures able to tempt even those of the opposing
side, capable of igniting an almost inextinguishable flame of love in even the inhuman hearts of
powerful Daeva, you are also a brilliant genius when it comes to handling the actual act of
having multiple partners as the same time. Be it via fear, love or a combination of both, you
could maintain your relationship with dozens of concubines at the same time, carefully
managing even their inter-harem relationships and managing to keep the flame of passion alive
for centuries with little effort."
150,200,What’s This Doohickey?,Campione,Providence,"Ah, supernatural powers. They don’t come with an instruction manual, be it the magic of mortals, the Authorities of Gods or something else entirely, one needs to get their exact limits and improve themselves by trial and error. Well not anymore, this little blessing works to take care of that. Now, you gain an innate knowledge of how to use any new powers you acquire, as well as their limitations and advantages. Doesn’t sound like much until you get a power-up in the middle of a battle and you realize you don’t know how to use it. Embarrassing. "
151,200,Sacrifices for Science,Bleach,Providence,"A Shinigami may sometimes think, are they actually the bad guys here? But that couldn’t be true. Yes, Captain Kurotsuchi often publishes in the newspaper reports of his live dissections and experiments
with prisoners. It is true that Zaraki has killed quite a few people out of mere boredom. Maybe the
whole genocide thing can be a little over the top. But if the higher ups don’t mind, who cares? So
long as you are beneficial for them and the organisation as a whole, people just don’t seem to care
about the horribly immoral actions you do. Even a kind man like Captain Ukitake tolerated the mass
murders that Mayuri carried out. Personal dislike can still fester between individuals, especially
those you personally harm or do wrong to, but wider action against you seems to slip everyone’s
mind. Even illegal actions, provided they do not outweight the benefits you provide, are ignored. If you
happened to work for the government already, you could quickly attain essential immunity to
breaking the law. All that is needed is that you continue to provide what they ask. Mayuri delivered
an endless flood of useful, sometimes vital, inventions and tools to the Shinigami. A revolutionary
mind whose value far exceeded a few thousand tortured souls. "
152,200,The Watcher,Bleach,Providence,"Three worlds full of wonders. Three worlds full of things to miss out on. Important things are occurring all the time, especially in secret, and many such events would provide a wealth of vital information for your studies. You’re lucky though. To the extent that it’s physically possible, you’ll see yourself often near important or dramatic events that happen in your current world, even when they should be hidden in secret or happening without your fore-knowledge. When drawn to such things, you’ll find it much easier than normal to remain hidden as you observe, even from experienced foes. It’ll end this protection if you attempt to interfere. Provided you stay hands off, you’ll have a ticket to see many of the most interesting and useful situations with little cost on your behalf. "
153,200,Shattered Shaft,Bleach,Providence,"Nothing can keep a hero down for long, not even losing what makes him a hero in the first place. As
long as you hold your convictions strongly in your heart, you’ll find it possible to regain power that
has been lost. Partially and in full, for both supernatural powers and more mundane sources of
influencing the world. Even having had your spiritual powers cut out of you, a path will unveil itself
to you in order to regain them. But these paths are dangerous and risky, offering a quick regain of what you lost at the price of
putting your life on the line, or perhaps something nearly as valuable. Lost spiritual powers could be
forcibly reawakened, or new equivalents gained, by subjecting yourself to near-hollowfication and
emerging victorious against your partially corrupted self. Another comparison might be the training
the Quincies undergo to recover their powers once they use Letz Stil, training to exhaustion and then
requiring an arrow fired to an exact spot on their hearts. "
154,200,Fully Realized,Bleach,Providence,"The world of businesses is just as cutthroat as the world of the shadows, particularly if you have a
distinct lack of morals and the willingness to murder or brainwash any potential opposition. It might not have to come to that though, since you’re actually rather talented when it comes to the field. Creating, running and expanding business is easy for you, regardless of what you actually might be selling. Organisations under your hand tend to experience explosive growth and will often quickly absorb similar rival companies in the same field, if you choose to act in such a predatory manner. No one minds when you get a little nepotistic either, installing your personal friends in positions of wealth doesn’t cause a fuss and those friends either luck into never causing trouble or discover useful talents of their own."
155,200,Friend of all Animals,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Providence,In the Garden Eden there was peace. Only Paradise and Harmony awaited its inhabitants... save for a Serpent of course. Even after man was banished from Eden the animals still loved Adam... as they do you. Animals of any kind love you and are easy to tame as well as come to your aid when its possible for them. A little Bird might tell you that the love of your live is in danger for example.
156,200,Curse Whisperer,Jujutsu Kaisen,Providence,"Cursed spirits are beings that are, by their very nature, malevolent. It wouldn’t be entirely incorrect to say their raison d’être is to cause suffering to humanity. Yet it’s not impossible to get along with them. Despite being a human sorcerer, Kenjaku was more than capable of allying with the likes of Jogo and Hanami, both of whom desired nothing less than the eradication of humans.

Now, for some reason, you too have found that cursed spirits are strangely fond of you... by the standards of curses, at least. At the very worst, they’ll be indifferent to you – so long as you don’t bother them or get in their way, you’ll find your life blessedly free from their interference. Weak curses won’t haunt you, and the stronger ones won’t try to kill you in some indiscriminate rampage. Those that have a reason to target you, however, won’t be dissuaded by this What’s more, if you put some effort in and make an appealing enough offer to them, they may even be willing to work alongside you, which is much more than can be said for most people. 

This perk works on any similar evil beings in future worlds."
157,200,Nothing Unusual ,Tsukihime,Providence,"You seemed like such a normal person,you know? Just a run-of-the-mill person from a secluded family on a hill. How could you have possibly been such a monster? You can easily blend in with ordinary humans, suppressing your supernatural and monstrous powers to what other humans would consider ‘normal’, removingall tells and even signs of supernatural hunger or cravings you suffer from. You could be an absolutely insane and bloodthirsty maniac and appear to all around you as a perfectly normal and delightful person to be around. You won’t abuse this, right...?
"
158,200,Hang On! I’m Still Transforming!,The God of High School Jump,Providence,"Transformations are great and all, the boost in power can really save your bacon, but in a real fight, people are rarely going to sit around as you go through a minute long transformation sequence. It’s pretty rude of them, don’t they know you can’t have a proper fight until you’re both going all out? Long as you have this, people will always wait for you to get in your best form once a fight starts. They won’t sit by and let you cast some healing magic or go have a nap first but if you’re pottering around in a sealed form for some reason, they won’t interrupt you as you reveal your real self, even if it’s just out of disinterest rather than awe of your great powers."
159,200,That Was My Old Life,The God of High School Jump,Providence,"Sometimes you gotta go into hiding. Maybe it’s to keep someone you care about safe or maybe you just can’t be arsed dealing with people coming after you but either way, you still need to be able to hunker down well and oh can you ever. As long as you’re actually in hiding and not being active, secretly or not, people just can’t seem to locate you. Methods both magical and mundane simply fail to even get close to you and if they’re really unlucky, people will just get sent on wild goose chases. Once you sneak back in, or burst back in if that’s your style, people will be able to get a lock on you once more but until then you can be assured of enjoying the quiet life."
160,200,No Curse Zone,Angel Notes,Providence,"The dead don’t always stay dead. Those killed don’t always die. But at least you can make sure that
the process of trying to beat them six feet under is one with much less collateral damage. You killing
something or defeating it, successful in making it stick or not, will prevent any death or defeat linked
effects from occurring. Creatures won’t give you a death curse for killing them, they won’t be able to
let loose one last curse with their final breath, no final explosions to destroy the entire continent
around you. They just die. Of course, they may come back to life but…if you did it once, you can do it
again, eh? At the very least any of that death-linked ‘grow stronger every time I revive’ stuff won’t
need to be dealt with. Nasty shock for the bad guy."
161,200,Lustful Thought,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Providence,"What evil queen would be such if they didn’t have mastery of certain skills and traits? Which ones?
The ones to drive men and women both to a madness of pleasure, where they can revel and indulge
in the lust and sin that comes from defeat at your hands. Your body has taken on an irresistable form
to most others, with charms and features that cloud the minds’ of others on mere sight with intense
lust, making even great warrior’s fumble with their blades against you, both the metal one and the
other one! Actually putting effort towards attaining someone you desire is simple, as your lustful
visage becomes far more intense when you apply your extensive skills in seduction alongside them. And should you get them into your bedroom, or just behind some bush somewhere or out in the
open, you can drive quite literally anyone capable of feeling physical pleasure to temporary madness
and defeat solely through the thorough, skillful and very enjoyable…application of your body to their
body. As long as they don’t physically fight you off, at least. As a useful extension of your lust-infused
body, you are also able to create a golden ‘mead’, through apparently unknown processes. This
mead is the liquid form of your lust powers and drinking from it can instantly bind those of less than
iron-clad wills to your commands, at least for a time."
162,200,New Life,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Providence,"What’s one more identity when you already have a few dozen at once? Once per year, when you have need of it, you’re able to easily take on a new identity that has been prepared for you. A new life in a new place, with all the documents and proof needed, even including people paid off or altered to remember you in their lives. It’s quite easy to get to these second chances, even when currently on the run from significant law enforcement efforts, and only the most dogged and obsessed detectives would continue to pursue you, as the change in identities is linked with a plausible death to your previous one. No import."
163,200,Happy Ending,Chrome Shelled Regios,Providence,"You easily attract the attention of those you have a crush on and if the feeling is mutual your relationship will continue with minimal fuss. If another wants to join in, well who are you to say no. Those you are in a relationship with will appreciate the positive parts of it and you will work through any negatives that may arise. A happy ending is in the story for you, so no worrying about your loved ones being targeted by unscrupulous individuals. As long as the involved parties want the relationship to work, it will be better than they could ever imagine. 
"
164,200,Queen,Chrome Shelled Regios,Providence,"You are a leader of the people, even when you push your work on others so you can have fun. You are so charismatic that you are beloved by your people, from when you are perving on your subjects to you when you are beating up your Heaven’s Blades. If it relates to administrative or logistical work you can do it all in a quick, efficient, and error free way. If you do not wish to do the work you can easily find quality people to do the “boring” work, so you can have fun.
"
165,200,Subduing With Dishes,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"Have you ever heard the expression that the way to someone’s heart is through their stomach? Well in your case that seems to be accurate. There is something truly special about the services you offer and other creations that you forge. Your meals will truly touch the hearts of those who eat them. Even your most hated foe would still offer you their respect let alone how someone neutral might react. This earns you the admiration and loyalty of those who taste your treats. The longer they continue to do so and the greater the taste the higher their loyalty becomes. You could literally conquer a kingdom by serving their leaders for a period of time. Should you cook something grand enough perhaps that meal alone could earn you their undying loyalty.

166,200,Bestial Reverence,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"Depending on the quality of their bloodlines, most spirit beasts are capable of suppressing other members of their races. For example Flowery is able to control any snake that she encounters since she is a snake with a divine bloodline. This perk won’t give you a bloodline, but it will grant you a similar power. Each time you purchase this perk you may select one type of animal to gain control over. You will be treated like an honored member of their species whenever you encounter your chosen group. Some examples of this are snakes, dogs, shrimp, or another type of species. By paying an additional 100cp you may select a broader group. Using the previous examples you could upgrade them to dragons, canines, and sea creatures. 
"
167,200,Transcending Beauty,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"For one reason or another almost everyone in this world seems to be incredibly attractive. This becomes more noticeable the more powerful an individual becomes. This perk grants you two effects. First you become overwhelmingly beautiful/handsome. You would be worthy of being called a heavenly fairy or an equally impressive title. Second, as you grow stronger you shall become even more attractive. This effect occurs both with your cultivation rank as well as your overall power. It is believed that this occurs due to the body being purified whenever someone advances their rank."
168,200,Surrounded by Beauties,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"For one reason or another Bu Fang seemed to constantly be in the company of a supernaturally beautiful woman. This was ironic considering his sheer devotion to cooking which made him ignore all of them. Maybe you will actually enjoy this. You share his luck with these talented and attractive individuals. You will constantly run into and be in the company of desirable individuals that fit this criteria. This will work on your preferred gender meaning you can instead gain the attention of your paramour depending on your desires. Lastly this will also boost your natural charisma and charm so that you can attract the beauties you encounter. 
"
169,200,Humble Nature,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"Humility is a virtue that few Cultivators care to acknowledge exists when
not forced to, let alone actively cultivate in of itself. Like some scholars, you
know better than to be a barbarian. Over time you have learned how to be
humble and considerate of others in spite of massive power gaps, in either
direction. You could treat a mortal peasant with the same respect as you
would the Emperor of the Crimson Phoenix Empire without any issue. Also,
you are quite good at brewing tea."
170,200,One Big Family,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"Community is important in these times. Villages live and die on the
cooperation of its people and the occasional aid from other villages. So
naturally family is important. And when it comes to family? Everyone’s in it
as far as you are concerned. You have phenomenal luck in accepting
others into a communal family and being accepted in turn. Over time you
can share this trait with anyone close enough to you."
171,200,This Young Mistress!,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"People tend to make assumptions about you, usually useful ones if often
grating. This can grant you a lot of leeway in your actions, or even open up
entirely new opportunities if you play your cards right. But ultimately when it
comes to said assumptions, you can either let them lie or show them the
truth with your words and actions."
172,200,Birds of a Feather,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"To survive in the Underbridge isn’t easy, especially if you go it alone.
Thankfully, you don’t have to. You have a knack for cooperating quite well
with anyone who shares similarities with you. Even if you might otherwise
not be on the best of terms you can get people to work together for a
common goal. Getting a bunch of street rats to work together to see
another day? Easier than breathing."
173,200,Outer Beauty Matching the Inner Strength,Against The Gods,Providence,"A general rule of this world is that the more
handsome/beautiful someone is, the more powerful they are. This applies to you too. As your
strength and power grows, so do your looks, and vice-versa.
Not just this, but with this perk the baseline of this advancement is set permanently to the absolute
peak possible for humanity, meaning you’re among the 0.01% of the fittest, healthiest, strongest and
most beautiful non-cultivating people on the planet already, and only grow from there."
174,200,Celestial Profound Basic Decency Inducement,Against The Gods,Providence,"This world... you don’t know what
exactly is wrong with it, but you can at least do your part in making it better.
You have the incredible power of making people act like rational human beings. Through a
conversation, a beating, or whatever other method you like, you can beat the intricate mysteries of
Common Sense and Basic Human Decency into people lacking them, and make it stick."
175,200,Supremely Ancient Experienced Expert,Against The Gods,Providence,"These young brats all think they’re hot shit. What
do they know? You were already old before they were born. But that doesn’t mean you’re any
weaker.
With this perk, your skills remain in top form, regardless of how old you are or how long it has been
since you used them last. You never forget a trick, and your talents never wane. You could sit in the
lotus position cultivating for half a millennium, and come out twirling your sword, ready to cut down
all who oppose you. This perk also prevents you from permanently losing potential through injury.
While you can be set back, you can always regain it with time and effort."
176,200,Protect The Lessers,Cradle,Providence,"You've got an instinct for how to change your appearance,
mannerisms, etc to blend in. Better still, if you're using some higher power to accomplish
something, you can pass it off as merely a magical artifact you have, and people will tend to
believe you. The otherworldly becomes ordinary. That fireball you just threw? Oh, it's just a

piece of pyrotechnic equipment. Your godly, sculpted armor that has no seams, somehow?
Don't worry about it, it's magic. You get the idea."
177,200,Fighting Spirit,Cradle,Providence,"Something about combat is simply exhilarating for you. You'll never
shy away from a battle, but you simultaneously know your own limits, and what's actually worth

fighting for. As a more practical application of this Fighting Spirit, you'll find that your magical
and physical energy reserves often last far, far longer than they should, well past the point
where you should have faltered. Try not to squeal like a schoolgirl in the aftermath of a good
bout of arena fighting."
178,200,Actualized,Cradle,Providence,"When you make a large-scale plan, the pieces will simply click into place.
Unless there is deliberate interference, you can move your pawns almost as if you were truly
playing them on a game board, without fear of things like orders going missing. Of course,
nothing stops the plan from falling, no real plan survives the enemy, after all. But it's nice to
have people actually follow through on things."
179,200,Pokemon of a different variety,World Seed,Providence,"With so many different races and cultures existing in the galaxy, is it really a surprise that some
of them go in a direction that is, let’s say, uncommon on earth? Simply put, you seem to attract
girls and other people (they don’t actually have to be people, ain’t nobody gonna knock you for
loving a squid) that you would be romantically interested in, and not just one of them. Strangely
enough, nobody seems to mind if you have many different lovers at the same time, neither the
girls themselves nor any people around you, even if they would normally condemn such a thing.
And instead of soon falling apart like they tend to do when it concerns other people, any
polyamorous relationships you are part of will always thrive instead, each member either simply

continuing to love you or coming to love and cherish the other ones as well, depending on your
preference. And to reassure you, no, this is not mind control. Just you having, uhhh, such a
great personality, yes."
180,200,Return to Base,Dragon Ball,Providence,"Transformations are a useful and common method to increase the user’s power. This
however, is a measure that true experts look down on. For example, none of the
powerhouses within the Universes utilize transformation such as Beerus, Whis, or
Vados. Either through your own comprehension or through the advice of an Angel you

have absorbed the power of your transomations into your normal state. This allows you
to perform at your maximum power without straining your body. Anytime you acquire a
new transformation this effect will be implemented as you adjust to your new form."
181,200,Beacon on the Battlefield,Dragon Ball,Providence,"The arrival of an elite ally or the death of a powerful enemy typically serves as the
turning point in most battles. You have learned how to capitalize on this effect through
two methods. The first method is to inspire your allies. Your mere presence on the
battlefield will boost your allies morale and power. This effect will be amplified through
heroic acts, stylish entrances, or other significant displays.
The second method is to demoralize your foes. For your enemies your visage will
inspire terror, reducing their morale. Killing strong opponents, hitting key targets, or
even broadcasting a threatening speech can cripple your enemies. Lastly, both of these
effects can be boosted as you increase in strength. If you’re strong enough your
enemies may seemingly lose the will to live while your allies' strength multiplies."
182,200,Minimized Consequences,Dragon Ball,Providence,"Many powerful techniques and transformations have some sort of negative effect. For
example, both the Great Ape and Super Saiyan transformation enrage the user.
Somehow your body seems to naturally minimize if not outright remove these issues.
Using the previous example if you transformed into a Great Ape you would retain all of
your mental capabilities. On the other hand something like the Kaioken would simply
strain your body to a significantly lesser degree."
183,200,Face Me Cowards!,Dragon Ball,Providence,"While it may be looked down on occasionally some factions will attack each other when
their powerhouses are gone. For some reason however, your foes are willing to use this
tactic against you. Perhaps this is due to fear of your retaliation or some form of honor.
Essentially if anyone is acting against you they will not move against your allies or
anyone you care about. This however, is only meant to activate in negative instances.
For example, while at war the enemy leader won’t single handedly destroy your
homeworld, but their army might attack it. If you wish to for whatever reason you may
optionally disable this protection or narrow its range."
184,200,Hybrid Potential,Dragon Ball,Providence,"Hybrids between Saiyans and humans such as Gohan are blessed with immense
potential. Their bloodlines harmonize granting them a growth rate far beyond either
species norms. This perk allows you to take this property for yourself and your
descendants. You can safely fuse or otherwise become a member of multiple species
without issue. There will be no conflicts between your traits. Instead you’ll acquire the
best of each world without acquiring any of their weaknesses. This also guarantees that
you inherit any natural ability without suffering a loss in potency. Lastly, you will find that
each additional species will only increase the synergization between them. This will
continuously propel you further and further beyond your race's limits."
185,200,Zenkai Boost,Dragon Ball,Providence,"Zenkai are arguably the most famous trait of the Saiyan race aside from the infamous
Super Saiyan form. This innate trait allows Saiyans to rapidly grow in power after
recovering from severe injuries. The closer to death the Saiyan is the greater the boost
they receive afterwards. Typically these boosts are between ten and thirty percent
however, some rare instances have been recorded reaching up to a thirty times boost in
power. By purchasing this perk you can acquire this trait for yourself. The best part
however, is that your Zenkai will always tend to be on the bigger side. For example, if
you were given a wound that normally boosts a Saiyan’s strength by 5% then your
boost might be 20%. This will scale exponentially as the injury you recieve is considered
more severe."
186,200,Sever Away the Perfection!,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"In life, as well as in cultivation, hope is never really lost. Not if you know the right stuff or know
people who know it. Even if you achieve a Perfect Stratum after untold toils and some asshole
just happened to rip it out of you... hope still endures.
Especially for you. With this perk, any and all progress you make in your powers is a cosmic
fact, something that can be suppressed, that can be made to slow down and otherwise... but
never really taken away from you.
No matter what, how, or who it is trying it, your powers and abilities, from those acquired
through cultivation or other means or those innate to you, are rendered inviolable with this
perk. While they can be temporarily affected, you always always recover them all, and even to
hamper them temporarily it takes untold amounts of work from people stupidly more powerful
than you.
Needless to say, this also works to prevent your skills and abilities against the simple ravages of
time. No matter how long you go without fighting or exercising, none of your muscles atrophy
and none of your skills fade from your memory in the slightest."
187,200,I’m Going to Screw it to Death!,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"Is something that should really be questioned more than it is. Unless you have this! Just like the
Lord Fifth, you have the terrifying ability of people close to you just not caring what you
threaten to do to people who are not them... or even the things you actually do to people who
are not them.
So long as it’s not directly against them or their close friends or family, no one seems to see any
of your actions as bad, wrong or even untoward. This doesn’t stop the people you mistreat
from coming at you in any way, but you can be pretty confident they’ll be alone.
Friends and family don’t find issues with you doing fucked up shit to other people."
188,200,Bashful Smile,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"You have that certain je ne sais quoi about you, that draws people to develop deep, immensely
strong attachments to you. It isn’t any kind of strong charisma, mind you. Don’t go expecting to
pull crowds. Indeed, it’s entirely possible for a lot of people to dislike or even hate you.
But for the people who do like you, they like you a lot. All your friends tend to be true friends,
loyal through thick and thin so long as you’re loyal too, all romantic relationships burn with an
intensity rarely matched in all the cosmos, and even other kinds of companions are true ones.
Certainly, they’re not your slaves, they might argue with you and even fight, but when it really
matters, you can count on them without question or concern."
189,200,I Want To Start A Clan,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"If you actually do have such an absurd ambition like that, well... You’re certainly well equipped
for it. Regardless of your appearance, you have an absolutely astonishing ability to seduce
people you are attracted to and have them fall in love with you.
Of course, that’s not nearly enough to start a proper clan, no. Your raw magnetism doesn’t
diminish regardless of how many people you are currently in a relationship with, allowing you
to easily start more and more relationships wherever you go.
What’s more, the people you enter relationships with will come to a harmony with one another
and resolve any issues before they even begin. Those with compatible orientations might even
begin relationships with one another as well, though you’ll remain the nucleus of the entire
web.
You could start and maintain a harem of 500 people while easily remembering all of their
names and details while ensuring none of them feel neglected. You’ll even remember all of the
names and details of their children, grandchildren and great-children."
190,200,Plentiful Weapon Rain,One finger Death Punch,Providence,"Students of the Death Punch are favoured by heaven, never far from weapons. Caches of blades and
steel are always nearby, and replacement blades may be literally lowered from the sky if needed."
191,200,Authority Circumventing Stance,Generic Exalted,Providence,"So long as you don't make a particular effort to stand
out people of higher social standing than you won't make any particular effort towards messing
about with you. If they do focus their attention on you they will be more prone to letting you off
the hook lightly rather than, say, having you whipped and beaten and then enslaved because
you weren't bowing your head fast enough. As a mortal this will take you a long way, especially
if you're anywhere with a heavy Dynast presence, and as an Exalt people will be more likely to
think you're less of a threat or concern than you are unless you give them explicit reason to
think otherwise. Even if they know you're an Exalt they won't think you're any more dangerous
than a typical example of your kind unless they have personal experience otherwise.
Additionally you will have an instinctual knowledge, if not a specific one, of how to avoid those in
authority and those that represent such authorities no matter what land or place you travel to.
This manifests as a sort of sixth sense that warns you when you’re about to do something or go
somewhere where ‘authorities’ would notice and take umbrage with you."
192,200,Sworn Brotherhood,Generic Exalted,Providence,"You may at any time form a brotherhood between sworn
companions. Normally this would be limited to five individuals, but you can create a bond
between up to nine (8 companions and yourself). This bond is magically reinforced, and so long
as it remains intact you will all be considerably empowered when working alongside one
another, far more than you ever would be alone. Charms become cheaper, skills become more
refined, disputes and even hard feelings are suppressed. Over time your bond will deepen, able
to finish each other's sentences, divine each other's thoughts, and eventually reaching the point
where you don’t even need to speak to each other, as everyone involved has such a deep
connection that they have transcended the need for mere speech.
If any member of the brotherhood is in danger all of the rest will instantly know of it, and will
have a perfect understanding of the members location, relative to their own, that is in danger. If
you truly desire to do so, you and your sworn companions may dissolve this bond. You may
reform another in the future, however, when and if you desire. Additionally this bond, unlike the
one that exists in canon, is not restricted to only the Dragon-blooded."
193,200,Great Radiance,Solars Exalted,Providence,"The Solar Exalted were meant to be the kings, generals, and visionaries
of the other Exalts. Whether or not they fit the role accordingly is subject to centuries of debate
and the Usurpation, but there is no denying that you are larger than life. A quirk of your
Exaltation allows you to draw in light around yourself, letting rays of sunlight (or nearby artificial
lights from flame or technology) shine down on you in an angle that wordlessly communicates
your importance, which can intimidate the wicked or reassure your allies. In addition, you are
able to freely toggle the visual intensity of your anima...whether making the brightest light
without spending a single mote of Essence, or making it quietly vanish even after you have
demonstrated your fantastic might. If nothing else, this will greatly frustrate those who were
hoping to track you this way."
194,200,Improbable Concealment Technique,Solars Exalted,Providence,"The Night Caste has no shortage of stealthy
warriors and spies, able to vanish from the mind's eye even if they had just finished talking to
someone out in the open not even a second before. But what of the future, of foes with senses
beyond the five, or someone the Solar happens to bump into on accident? By simply covering
their face with something - anything from a mask, the shade of a hat, or a piece of cabbage will
enhance their stealth prowess. Not only will they much more easily vanish from sight, whether
from mundane ability or Charms, but those with supernatural or enhanced senses...anything
from the ability to see the future, to predict the Solar's movements, tracking or any other indirect
method of detection - simply fails to work until they choose to fight or reveal themselves. This
includes technology beyond this world, such as radar or similar devices."
195,200,Below Notice,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"Malfeas is a place where time has little meaning, the green hang overhead at all times of
day, while the constellations and weather move guided by the whims of many, many
individual demons. There are no months or season, yet demons knows the passing of the
year through Calibration. A time when the borders between worlds grow thin, and
enterprising demons may attempt to leap through a gap into Creation.

More importantly however, on the five days of Calibration, the Unquestionable set
themselves apart. Whether to commune with their Yozi or the prepare for a summons, it
matters little to the lesser demons. Whatever the reason, they leave the other demons alone.
This yearly taste of freedom is considered a true holiday to demonkind, and now you may
carry that with you on further days. Whenever you wish, you may appear to others as
someone or something below notice. Such that enemies will simply walk past you, any of
your superiors will care not for your absence nor call upon your services, and even your
closest friends may fail to notice you sitting amongst them."
196,200,Her Hate Is Safer,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"Sometimes, Adorjan falls in love. Her hate is safer. Such did Marus, the murderer of Lilike,
Fetich soul of the River of Torments, come to understand too late as he came to regret the
love of Adorjan and vainly sought to earn her hatred until his terrible death.
But perhaps you believe you shall be different? Certainly you’ll be able to catch the interest
of alien and powerful beings much easier with this. And you'll even get a sense for how to try
strike up an actual romance with such exotic entities, as well as how to maintain something...

reminiscent of a relationship. Just remember that you must never forget what her love
means..."
197,200,Border of Impossibility,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"Firstborn of the Primordials, Oramus, the Dragon Beyond the World, whose mind dwelled on
alien vistas beyond perception. The conceptual Without, an infinite forge of the impossible
that stirred the very Wyld into forms and patterns by the movement of its thoughts. As a
being of anomaly and chaos, Oramus defied all attempts to define or contain his nature.
Instead, it was he who defined others, declaring all that was inside and outside Creation.
So too, does your presence defy definition and containment, allowing you to walk along the
border of the impossibility that is Beyond. Aside from being a little harder to lock down, this
grants you one more impressive capability. Impossibility itself follows in your wake, thus you
may make the unlikely into something probable, the nigh-impossible into the likely, and
perhaps one day even the impossible into the presumed. While that day may be far away for
now, you will still find that unlikely things will happen often around you."
198,200,Grinning Behind A Mask Of Skin And Lies,Abyssals Exalted,Providence,"The greatest weapon the members of the Day Caste can wield is subtlety. They nurture
hidden hatreds, biding their time for the right moment to strike rather than spoiling their
vengeance with rash and brutish force. Joining the ranks of those most subtle, you gain the
patience and guile to hide your motives from even your fellow servants of Oblivion. Even if
you stay where your erstwhile allies can see you, they'll have quite a bit of trouble figuring
out you have another agenda (or twelve) hidden behind your wan smiles or demure façades.
But the Daywalkers also walk easily among the living, unnoticed until they kill. As they spend
more time among the living than many other Abyssals do, they learn how to pass
themselves off as alive, a talent you've picked up as well. If you wish, you may look
completely ordinary to observers, aside perhaps skin a little paler than the norm."
199,200,Lessons Learned,Mushoku Tensei,Providence,"Normally, when a person makes mistakes they would need time to fully understand its consequences and they
can only try to never make the same mistake again. But with this you are different, whenever you make any
mistakes in battlefield, politics or your everyday life you learn from them and always end up better than before.
A mistake in the battlefield that left you wounded, a mistake in politics that left you vulnerable to be exploited
by others, a mistake that broke your family and more would not happen again. This even tells you how to fix
mistakes you’ve made and make sure they never happen again. You can set an ideal or role-model that you want
to follow in order to become a better person and you will know what you need to do to become a better person
and even recognize any action that would make you diverge from this path. This only tells you what you need to
do; whether you actually do it is up to you. You can change your ideal and role-model if you find a better path."
200,200,Invasive Culture,Mushoku Tensei,Providence,"Introducing something new to a primitive society doesn’t always go well as there would be others who deny and
resist the change. With this you can smoothly introduce anachronistic, foreign ideas and technology to advanced
or primitive societies. While you may not be able to upend trends and persistent memes, your words will always
carry weight, and you’ll be considered a brilliant revolutionary and inventor instead of a dangerous lunatic
when introducing advanced idea’s and technologies. When the ideas and technologies that you introduced to a
society even as a small village populated by hundred people become common, these ideas and technologies
would slowly spread to the entire society which that small village belongs to. The granted ideas and
technologies can be replicated by the current standards of the society or the methods which are publicly known."
201,300,Team Mom - Boosted,UQ Holder,Providence,"People underestimate the power of a home-cooked meal sometimes. You’re going to be blowing their socks off when they taste your food and that’s only mostly because of the literal magic in it. Perhaps not the best way to spend your eternal life, but you did end up making a wide array of magical spells to take care of the chores of the house, which got a little bit crazy over the years. Cleaning? A click of your fingers and you can not only clean entire mansions but also heal, give rest to, and effectively feed and water every resident of that mansion. Cooking? The meals you serve out can outright buff the eaters to almost twice as much power as they might normally have, among a wide range of other health benefits like increased stamina and much better skincare. Of course, you also gain an average amount of magical energy to power this magic."
202,300,Mendicant,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"An order of beggar knights, the knights here are all poor, and are often just getting by in life. However, despite this, Mendicant knights are considered the most dangerous of the 4 orders. By trying to hide your true power, you become someone looked down upon, and enemies often underestimate you. This lasts until you stop hiding, of course, but isn’t it worth it to see the surprise on your enemy's face before you strike them down in a single stroke?"
203,300,Belligerent,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"The order of Bloody Knights, the knights of this order are always searching for a good fight. They wander the roads, looking for someone (or something) to battle. By choosing this perk, you now have the tendency to find things that will always challenge you, regardless of your power. You will never be stuck at a certain point, just because nothing challenges you anymore."
204,300,Boundless Freedom,"A Cultivator's Beginning",Providence,"Cultivators travel to dangerous places to seek treasures and legacies. Sometimes they would die, while others would be unable to escape and be trapped there for an indefinite period of time. While this won’t change the former, it will aid in the latter.

No prison is impossible to escape, no formation, technique, or power can bind you, and no dimensions can seal you. You always find a way to escape no matter how helpless the situation is. It would only be a matter of time for you."
205,300,"Three as One
","A Cultivator's Beginning",Providence,"As someone that cultivates all three cultivation systems, your body, ki, and soul progressions will now always be equal to each other. Any conflicts and restrictions this would cause simply won’t exist, allowing you to cultivate without problem.

Any negative effect, technique, or power that is harmful to you that only affects one cultivation system won’t take effect unless it targets both the others as well.
"
206,300,Delinquent’s ambition,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Providence,"You are possessed of an ambition that will guide you
towards your ultimate goal. You may choose for yourself a single overriding ambition or
tangible, definitive goal (Defeating a particularly strong overarching enemy would fit, becoming
the strongest in the world would not as there is no gauge for when or how this would be
accomplished). Once this ambition is established you will become much more alert to transient
events and opportunities that will advance this ambition. You will instinctively know and
recognize any opportunity that will further you ambition, though you must be quick and clever
enough to grasp it when it comes by. You may only have one active ambition at any given time
and cannot retake an ambition that you have already given up on."
207,300,"Reading Ahead",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"An experienced warrior doesn’t need to wait for their opponent. You can intercept their
brainwaves directly, letting you know and start responding to an opponent’s next move
0.5 seconds before they make it. This means that opponents can’t take advantage of the
window between your thoughts and action, and for much
weaker opponents, it’s like fighting a mind reader. –"
208,300,"The Truest of Tributes",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"Bonds between fighters are a beautiful thing. Forming a close bond with someone will let
you learn their fighting style abnormally fast and merge it into your own. Transplanting
part of their body onto your own will result in no rejection or incongruity, and you’ll even
receive the original owner’s muscle memory through the transplant. "
209,300,"A Modern Pirate",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"You’ve made allies of the land, sea, and sky alike. You can draw power from the Earth to
aid your strikes or dig like a mole and sail the seas even on a poorly made raft. As for the
sky, a good gust will act as a literal second wind, bringing you back to prime condition and
beyond, even if you were already heavily wounded and unconscious. –"
210,300,Slap On The Wrist,Street Fighter,Providence,"All it takes is a moment of passion, a slip up as you go just a bit too far and
lose your ability to bring law breakers to justice. You rough a street thug up just a bit too much and
get suspended? That just won't do. Upon purchase, laws become a bit more. . .flexible for you.
 As long as you're working alongside the law instead of against it, you're given a lot more leniency
in how you go about catching scum bags. Running across a busy highway in hot pursuit? You're good.
Beating the snot out of someone resisting arrest? You're good. Going off the radar for months to
infiltrate a villainous organization and take it down from the inside?
 Your superior might want a report on his or her desk by Friday, but you're good. Even if you're not
an active member of some form of law enforcement and trying to make a citizen's arrest, there's a
lot you can get away with before being declared a vigilante. You can't just start handing out the
death sentence to jay walkers, but enforcing the law your way is a lot easier."
211,300,Steel Trap Clarity,Street Fighter,Providence,"It's a sad fact, but traitors and spies are lurking everywhere. Their hands
forced by blackmail, willingly becoming a double agent from bribery or falling to good old fashioned
brain washing. Not you though, absolutely not.
 Upon purchase, you become excessively resistant to traditional forms of corruption, mystical
forms of brain washing and everything in between. Something with mind boggling power may still be
able to put you under its control.
 Most of the threats to your morals or sanity in this world are just out of luck. Additionally, you will
always be able to keep a clear idea of your personal principles, meaning you won't stray off of your
path on accident.
"
212,300,Personal Illusion,Street Fighter,Providence,"Being looked over or disguised isn't always the best way to hide your identity
and do what you want. Sometimes you need to intimidate without exposing yourself, and that's
where a little bit of good old fashioned hypnosis comes into play.
 Upon purchase, somehow, through application of hypnosis and the power of suggestion, you can
make everyone who sets their eyes on you perceive you as you wish to be perceived.
 If you're a lithe woman and wish to scare people off with the visage of a giant, demonic man, this
is just the thing for you. This allows you to appear as whatever you wish providing it's not too much
bigger or smaller, but it is an illusion at the end of the day."
213,300,With Fame Comes Influence,Street Fighter,Providence,"Your name in lights, your face on billboards, you're a star, baby!
A VIP! Well, not yet anyways, you gotta do something to earn that household name level of fame,
and I've got just the thing for it.
 This perk causes your achievements and feats known to the public to generate a whole lot more
buzz than they usually would. The path to stardom is a lot shorter for you than others with this in
hand, it's just a fact.
 Not only that, as the name of the perk implies, your reputation transfers more easily towards
influencing others. Using the weight of your name can get you preferential treatment for yourself
and others, allowing you to more easily get backstage at concerts, make reservations in really
upscale locations with a waiting list, discounts in stores, endorsements, you name it.
 Just make sure you don't get too cocky and you got from household name to washed up C-Lister
because you did something that attracted the wrong kind of attention."
214,300,Social Network,Street Fighter,Providence,"There are many, many social circles all over the world someone of such skill
and prestige could get themselves into. You wouldn't believe what you hear on the grapevines
either, rumours swirling about that some hear all about and others are nigh ignorant of.
 Upon purchase, it becomes vastly simpler to make quick connections and acquaintances from all
sorts of classes, social circles, cliques, cultures and so on. People willing to hold a conversation with
you, small talk, or maybe something a bit more useful.
 All these quick acquaintances you make are surprisingly willing to share whatever they know
about current rumours or buzz worthy events going on nearby. If you have some ability to easily get
in touch with multiple at once, it'd almost be like establishing your own spy network."
215,300,Gourmet Luck,Toriko,Providence,"Gourmet Luck allows blows to land and his opponents' to miss, but must watch out to not use it too often because it could quickly run out. "
216,300,Dire Alliance,Toriko,Providence,"Sometimes, some threats are too serious to care about someone's occupation. With that, not only You’ll be able to form alliances with those that are You’re moral opposite, but also some of your illegal dealings would be ignored, as long as Jumper helps dealing with threats that have the potential to cause massive casualties for both sides. "
217,300,Fall In Line,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"The battle is to the strongest! You either lead, follow,
or get the hell out of the way. When you perform great deeds or fight for something you believe
in, you attract devout and capable followers and underlings that will rally under your banner.
Unique and powerful individuals require a more personal touch than this, but many others who
have witnessed your strength will all-too eagerly see you as their guide and leader."
218,300,Crippling Escape,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Providence,"In this world, the path that all immortal
cultivators take is that of defying the Heavens, yet before one reaches the stage of fully breaking
free from their rules, they can at any time be wrenched back completely and thrown back into the
mortal coil by other practitioners. This process is called crippling of the cultivation base, and
anyone who is subjected to this fate is forever doomed to be a mortal for the rest of their lives.
Meaning that they shall never again taste the power they once had, and never again taste the
closeness to immortality. Not for you, however, as such wounds will always find a way to heal in
time, and depending on their severity, you could find yourself back to treading the immortal path
once more in several months. Post-Jump, you’ll find that any wounds or injuries that would
normally leave you crippled or forever bound to their effects will wash away in time. Extremely
powerful effects such as curses from a God may take a lot of time, however."
219,300,Treasures Galore,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Providence,"Treasures are the life of a
cultivator because they determine their ability to fight, buy other treasures, and generally survive.
How could someone ever claim to be an expert without having something to show for all the
blood, sweat, and tears they’ve spent? With this, such material wealth simply comes to you of its
own accord. Finding a legendary sword at the Xiantian level that would make even Wanxiang
Adepts green with envy? Just a regular Tuesday. Stockpiling so many different Immortal Estates
you use them on and off? Might take a couple of decades. Finding the legacy of a supreme expert
whose very power makes the hearts of others clench in fear? Might happen at least once a jump, or
once per cultivation stage. This applies even in world's where there are no such things."
220,300,Lucky Lucky Lucky,A Will Eternal,Providence,"You should know this whole routine by now. Near every Xuahuan and Xianxia protagonist
has one thing above all else. They are incredibly lucky. Whether this means finding treasure
after treasure, or constantly surviving deadly situations by the skin of their teeth, they seem
to be blessed by the heavens. Even if you don’t go looking for trouble, trouble will often still
find you, given the sheer scale of the battles of cultivators. That’s why it’s good to have a fair
share of luck yourself. You won’t be turning over rocks to find ancient treasures left and right,
but when it truly matters, usually something is going to happen that will help you out of a
rough spot."
221,400,Making My Way Back,UQ Holder,Providence,"For some immortals, the only kind of defeat that they could suffer is being left stranded or imprisoned. Buried under miles of rocks or sent to outer space can effectively kill an immortal, at least in the sense that matters for those on Earth. But not when it comes to you. You’re always able to, eventually, get out of any sort of imprisonment or stranding. If you’re left far underground, a tunnel will open up that allows you to crawl your way out after a few hours. If you’re in outer space, you might need to just wait a few days till you’re picked up. Even being imprisoned in another dimension, away from the rest of reality, won’t keep you from the rest of civilization for more than a few weeks at most.
"
222,400,The Springfield Factor,UQ Holder,Providence,"You like girls, Jumper? Or boys? Whichever one you like really seems to like you too. You’re a natural-born charmer, perhaps a cousin to the Springfield family, and attractive, interesting, useful, and often powerful members of your preferred sex will gather around you without any real effort on your part, most of them falling in love with you with very little or even no effort on your part. Just going through life will probably attract a dozen or more devoted ‘admirers’ to your burgeoning fan club. Actually trying to get people interested, being a heroic figure or just acting in an impressive way at all? You’re going to need a book just to keep track of all the girls that are wanting a piece of you. Or all of you. For the rest of their lives. In marriage. Really, get that paper ready, this’ll get complicated."
223,400,Not So Far Now,UQ Holder,Providence,"Dreams are things to be pursued. Not all those that chase after their dreams will catch them, but you always get past the first step. No matter what your dream or goal might be, you are always given a genuine chance at achieving them, though the worth of this chance varies depending on how difficult your dream is. Want to race in the Olympics? You’ll find yourself meeting an Olympic recruiter on a day when you’re in your best condition and ready to give him a good showing. Want to achieve world peace? You won’t get a two-step plan for it, but you will find that you meet a number of like-minded people with some influence of their own and are put in place to achieve positions of authority that will help you get higher up in the world."
224,400,Push It Further,Cradle V1,Providence,"As you explore the world, you will be dying to experiment with everything you see. No matter what you attempt, any experiment to grant you more power will be at least somewhat compatible and won’t result in instant death or hideous mutations. Any power you do receive will be integrated into your body seamlessly. This works for other things, like martial arts, but not the various pools of energy in your body."
225,400,Apprenticeship,Cradle V1,Providence,"As a traveler from the heavens, your very presence in this world will make you very interesting to the movers and shakers. You become the Apprentice to a sage or monarch. They will teach you their personal path, and while it may be painful, you’re be on a shortcut to power like no other, besides being a princeling."
226,400,Mountain Rooting Step,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Just because you are small doesn’t mean you are a pushover. By standing still and focusing, you become immovable. That doesn’t mean that people can’t harm you, of course, it just means you can't be pushed back."
227,400,Great Master,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"It seems your reputation has spread. Good, it makes it all the easier to get students and followers. The wider and more famous you are, the more potential followers you get.
"
228,400,Enemy Mine,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Sometimes petty rivalries can get in the way, but not when you are around. You can make people who hate each other, including yourself, work together. This, however, doesn’t mean they are gonna enjoy it, and they may also backstab each other when a chance presents itself."
229,400,Unlimited Chariot,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Why let petty things like walls or cages stop you? It seems that objects designed to keep you out, or keep you in, are like paper under your blows. Let nothing hold your justice back."
230,400,The Watchful,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"One of the problems with angels in this day and age is that they are quite corrupt, unwilling to help, or just outright uncaring. Whether you are an angel, you never become disconnected from those you are protecting, regardless of the power you hold or how far away you are in either mind or body."
231,400,Hidden from the Eyes of God,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Sometimes, you have to hide. When hiding, you do so with surprising effectiveness, and you can stay hidden so long as no obvious clues are there to point in your direction."
232,400,The Crew of Jumper,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Friendship is important. Sometimes it's the only thing preventing us from going mad. Thankfully, you will never have to deal with loneliness. You seem to naturally attract ""true companions,"" people who you can trust and see as equals."
233,400,"No Gods or Kings, Only Brothers",Baki The Grappler,Providence,"A born leader is what you are. Maybe it’s how you talk, how you walk, or just some
intangible quality about you, but you carry with you an aura that is equal parts dignified
and brotherly. Those who come to respect you don’t build the usual walls that come with
hierarchy. They’re able to open up and talk to you not as underlings, but as family. "
234,400,Perfect Parry,Street Fighter,Providence,"A normal parry is the simple deflection of an enemy attack to defend yourself
and open up their guard for a counter attack without taking the brunt force of their attack with a
block. Difficult, but worth it. Like countering, this isn't that.
 Upon purchase, you gain the ability to perform a ""Perfect Parry"". This is the act of waiting until the
exact moment before the enemy's strike would land to bring up your block against the attack. This
technique allows you to dramatically weaken or even outright nullify attacks and damage that may
have ordinarily knocked you out or killed you.
 This high risk, high reward defensive ability is incredible strong, but as you may expect, a mistimed
parry would have you take a potentially life risking attack head on, either unguarded or with your
block taking the full brunt of it. "
235,400,Long Course,Toriko,Providence,"Owning Gourmet Cells allow Monster Troll to reincarnate later for them savour new food flavor down in the line of their existence. Only limitation is that it needs Gourmet Cells from which Monster Troll could reform. After getting the Spark, the need for  Gourmet Cells is removed, allowing Jumper to reform from any cell they could left behind.
"
236,400,Mole In Charge,Toriko,Providence,"Congratulations! Thanks to your hard work (hiding corpses of rivals), great work ethic (blackmail and backstabbing) and admiration of colleagues (brainwashing) you reach the highest position in the organization. All techniques you apply in order to reach that position will have a great chance to go unnoticed. That perk also provides experience in those skills."
237,400,Hero of Myth ,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"Your actions do not exist in a vacuum - they are a
legend forged of your deeds, triumphs, and defeats across the stars and beyond. With each
claim to fame you acquire, your reputation will spread like wildfire and build an air of a
mythological hero around you...a reputation that will bleed into future worlds you jump to as
rumor and ancient myths like the Greek heroes of old, should you so wish it. Should you prefer
discretion, this effect can be toggled."
238,400,For Honor,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"Many times, the opponents of the Knights are merely
heroes on different sides, or those who would not mercilessly strike down an enemy without due
warning or chances to surrender. This may not be true in future worlds, but something about
you compels similar behavior out of others...so long as you do not openly act in a ‘dishonorable’
fashion through deception or cheap tactics, your opponents who can recognize this will feel their
own sense of honor brought forth by this. Those who are misguided or reluctant will likely cease
fighting you entirely, those who are dead set on their ways will give you chances to surrender or
leave. Finally, should you defeat a foe who you have more in common with than against, they
are likely to change sides and team up with you. Do note, this isn’t very effective against
individuals without sentience or some sort of guiding conscience...still, who ever said acting
honorably never paid off?"
239,400,"

Gemini’s Return",Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence,"A fool is someone acting the same twice and expecting different results, and to you they are all fools. Unless they really went overboard and left nothing of you, your enemies tend to leave you for dead without actually checking, giving you an opportunity to leave and recover. Be careful however, as it is merely an opportunity that can fail, and doesn’t help you to recover (it might not even be possible). As fewer chances to work each time on the same opponent.
"
240,400,Divine Gift,Saint Seiya Omega,Providence,"It appears that Pallas, or perhaps another god lurking in the shadows, has
bestowed upon you their undivided attention. This newfound focus could herald
both blessings and perils, but one thing is certain: divine beings within your
faction will now shower you with unprecedented generosity and favor. From this
moment onward, you will receive gifts and blessings beyond compare, far
surpassing what any normal servant could hope to receive in their entire lifetime."
241,400,Soul of the Blade,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"Fighting alongside you is an action not only unique to your allies. You may not realize it or even be able to sense it but the weapons you wield and armor that protects you can feel for you every bit as much as a friend could. The gear you’ve used for a while starts to gain a certain level of intelligence and autonomy, never enough to really become able of sapient thought but enough that it can act in order to help you independent of your own body. Weapons adjust themselves to hit perfectly when they might have missed, armor strengthens itself at the points you are hurt and magical staffs strain to channel more magical power. When in great need, they may even animate entirely separate from you to fight for you, swords swinging themselves through the air or armor animating and brawling with your foes, though such a thing can only be maintained for a short time."
242,400,The Doorstep of Victory,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"That moment when you arrive at the doorstep of death, just a hair away from defeat and thus destruction, that’s the point where your power really comes out to the fore. What your foes might think is the beginning of the end is just one last chance for you to turn the tide. Whenever you’ve been brought to the edge of defeat, you receive a large boost in overall power and skill to multiply what you had before by two or even three times. If you are instead about to die, rather than just mere defeat, this might be closer to ten times the normal boost. Be very careful when you utilize this, as while the increase in power will not endanger you, using it to continue a fight could result in your death as it will not heal you. If you manage to survive or even win, that increased power and skill will fade away until it is needed once more."
243,400,Big Bro,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"Strong as you are, you won’t be winning against the Titans on your own. The Saints are a powerful group but it is only when they are just that, a group, that they truly show their colors. You’re able to bring out the very best in those around you, your words of encouragement making people become able to break their limits and draw out an incredible amount of both power and emotion. Normally, these bursts of power are only temporary, but if you keep at it with someone, you’ll find that they retain more and more of the potential you encourage them to reach just by giving them inspiring words. And summoning up all that emotion out of someone can be pretty darn good for getting them over some internal issues too."
244,400,Pretty As A Rose,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"Few to none can hope to match the magnificence of your features. Even the Goddesses themselves feel jealousy when they look upon your features. You are one of the most beautiful beings in the world and as you grow in power, that power will only enhance your beauty all the more. Perhaps your cosmo infuses into your features to make yourself more gorgeous or perhaps just having that much more makes you all the more alluring. Whatever the case, you are almost incomprehensibly gorgeous already and will only become more so over time."
245,400,Our Fight Is Here,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"When the enemy tries to force you onto their home ground, you’re able to turn around and tell them to fuck right off. When an enemy attempts to force you into a different dimension or pocket realm in space, you’re able to cut that stuff out in a moment. If the dimension is something created by the opponent at that moment, it’ll be destroyed outright. If it was something that already existed, you and your opponent will instead be immediately returned to where you previously were, where you can prevent your opponent from even being able to summon it once again against you."
246,400,This Is Absurd,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"Gods are all too used to being the top dogs. It seems like a lot of them have no idea of just how strong a Saint can be, much less how strong you are. Any foe you have has a ludicrous level of underestimation for you. No opponent considers you a serious foe, unless you desire for this to not work, and even being confronted with direct evidence, to the point of having multiple allies that you have easily defeated explain how strong you are and why to them, will not make them give you a serious estimate. Even a foe that has already fought you once before will look at you and think they just made a mistake last time. More than two confrontations and they’ll start to take you seriously but before then, there’s nothing that will make them think you’re more than a joke."
247,400,Crash The Gates,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"Never again will you allow yourself or your family to be sealed, not after what you have only just gotten yourself released from. Whenever you come into physical contact with a seal on an object or being that has been sealed in some way, even partially, you are able to undo that seal in an instant. There is no cost from you to do this, just a simple exertion of will and the seal before you will crack and shatter before fading away harmlessly. Even those seals wrought by Zeus himself would not hold up against you, though you are not protected from any defenses the seal might have or what might be behind that seal."
248,400,Taboo Seeker,Feng Shen Ji,Providence,"As one who has delved into dark arts, you will find it easier to uncover their secrets. Opportunities to uncover secrets and forbidden knowledge seem to fall into your lap more often than not. Overhear a conversation a table over about a lost temple, or seem reliable enough to be entrusted secret/sacrificial techniques from your master. You also have found out how to imbue your Spirits of Corrosion into your own clothes or armor. Doing so confers several of the spirit's abilities such as flight and sharing their phasing abilities. The spirits imbued in your clothes are also capable of instantly defending the wearer against any physical or energy based attack; though while doing this the wearer cannot access the other abilities given by the spirits imbuement. You can imbue multiple Spirits of Corrosion into an item."
249,400,A Brillantly Shining Star,Fist Of The North Star,Providence,"You are impressive, perhaps it is your appearance, the way you
move, or your ideals but something about you inspires awe and jealous in others in equal measure. If it
is your looks expect to have men and women alike fawning over you in public while in private those
you've shunned and those with power plot to acquire you for themselves. If it is your movements that
catch the eye then expect to steal hearts while fighting, inspire unending jealousy in your rivals, and for
those you are killing to occasionally stop and stare while you end their life. With ideals like this you
can gather an army while preaching peace without anyone thinking you a hypocrite, after all they just
want to protect you. And if you are of a more militaristic bent then you could convince those you've
just conquered and enslaved to join you with a smile on their face."
250,400,Friend of Beasts,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Providence,"Like a certain egg Ji Ning gains in his travels, you seem to have the effect of endearing monsters
and other mindless beasts to you simply by being in their proximity no matter their strength. You
could easily tame something such as a Chaos Godbeast with barely any effort, and if you were to
meet something like a Chaos Primordial, while it would take a bit more time, would still be
doable. You also seem to have a strange effect of running into such beasts on a semi-regular

basis."
251,400,Hero of A Hundred Faces: Everyone’s Leader,Avesta of Black and White,Providence,"Some figures are too grand for the common man to properly comprehend them. In the case of the Arch-Demons, this provokes a deep fear and despair, comparable to facing a natural disaster of cosmic scale. But in your case, it is different.

The more unreachable you are, the more people find themselves attracted to you, like moths drawn to a colossal flame. Your defects are instead camouflaged under their own impressions of you, as any strangeness or red flags gets covered by their own projections. The more you grow in power, the more people are mesmerized by this effect, the deeper your mark on them is, and the harder they find to find anything to dislike you.

More than a hero, you become a living idol, a god on Earth that will leave a lasting legend for generations to come, regardless of how untimely your demise may be. Yet, even as grand as you become in their eyes, you find that it is still easy for you to maintain a closeness with any of these followers, being capable of acting as a close friend with any of them."
252,400,Disaster Purification,Campione,Providence,"A rare and powerful gift, the ability to negate all mortal magic that come in contact with it, strong enough to even weaken Authorities to a degree. Even someone without training in using such a power can easily dispel weaker magics around. For you, however, the scenario changes having mastered this gift completely and with enough control to not let your own magic be negated. The go to gift for anyone who wants to act as an anti-mage."
253,400,Fate Fell Short,Campione,Providence,"Given you broke its knees before the race even began after all. If destiny ever had a say in things then it shuts up and listen when it comes to you. The power of ‘fate’, ‘destiny’ and other bullshit has no say in your affairs. This is something that all Campiones share, being humans that killed Gods, but you take it to the next level in terms of sheer ‘fuck this’. Meaning that there’s nothing stopping you from breaking destiny and its rules as much as you feel like. This doesn’t make those tasks any easier, but they are not impossible anymore. Can be toggled if you ever feel like fate is actually helping you for once."
254,400,Demolition Man,Campione,Providence,"You’ll have to forgive others for the title, given you could very well be mistaken for an avatar of destruction with how much ruin lies in your wake. The bright smile you have on your face the more damage you dish out doesn’t help either. Seemingly predestined to destroy all you touch; your actions and powers have a talent for causing more damage than reasonably possible with every step. While this doesn’t help in direct combat, the surroundings come apart with frightening ease such that even a simple exchange between equals could leave a noticeable scar on a city or an all-out brawl demoting it to village status. Of course, you can reign over the amount of collateral damage in any fight you partake on, from none to destroying the roman colosseum in a friendly spar."
255,400,Slipping Chains,Campione,Providence,"The greatest power in this world have conditions to their use. Anything from standing in sunlight to being at death’s door to fight back depending on which Authority you hold. Often times just setting things up to begin fighting could leave you dead on the ground if everything doesn’t line up just right. In your case the chains that bind have been coated in grease. Sunlight could be replaced by electronic lights in great enough quantity, or perhaps a ludicrously sized fireball. Defending a fair maiden could become defending anyone, and one the verge of death could become grievously wounded. The core idea remains the same, but achieving them becomes far easier. You’ll find this slippery nature applying to any conditional otherworldly abilities you come to possess, should you have them at all."
256,400,Triumphant Return,Trinity Wonder,Providence,"What doesn’t kill you only makes you stronger. Well, not literally. Rather, every time you get defeated and forced to flee in a serious fight, you somehow manage to have a lucky encounter soon after. You will find something that can raise your strength by another level. This may not be enough to defeat the foe who struck you down, but it is certainly enough to give you a noticeable increase in your strength. Wujin and Pink Papa had four different fights at the edge of the world and every time Wujin lost. But with every defeat, with every fall down the cliffs he encountered something that just made him stronger."
257,400,The Name Means to Protect,Bleach,Providence,"Only for the sake of others, do you find your truest power unleashed. Being exerted through the soul, Reiryoku naturally increases as emotions burn hot but more than most, you find your power running
wild when you fight for the safety and happiness of another person. Spiritually, mentally and
physically, you find your power growing temporarily while directly in need to protect another, with
this benefit increasing depending on how closely bonded you are and how desperate the need for
help is. A stranger being beaten up by bullies might only inspire increased confidence in your own abilities
than any true growth in power. The same strange about to be slain by a hungry Hollow, desperately
calling for help? You could fight on even when exhausted as energy temporarily fills you to a little
more than your normal limit. But something like a dear friend begging for you to stand up and fight
again, their one saviour to whom they entrust their heart, could even bring you back from the dead
and force you to an entirely new level of strength. The power gained will leave once the danger ends
and too much power gained at once can leave you tired, drained or even unconscious for a while. "
258,400,Power of Friendship,Bleach,Providence,"The hero doesn’t fight alone, not these days. There’s no reason that the friends he fights for can’t
give it a go themselves to help him out, especially not when they’re in your presence. Your close
friends and trusted allies grow stronger alongside you as you fight and continue to adventure, provided they’re joining you in your struggles. To a lesser extent, they can take advantage of the speed at which you grow if they also make efforts to improve, likely to greatly increase their efforts. What makes you special in particular is the ability to awaken entirely new abilities in those around you, sometimes as a direct result of energy you project and sometimes as a coincidence of being wrapped up in the same schemes you’re trapped in. The result is that normal friends or those too
weak to really keep up in the struggles you face are able to develop powers that help bring them
nearer your level. They might discover sudden Fullbring heritage to save themselves when you
couldn’t reach them or suddenly unlock a supposedly impossible transformation to recover lost
power as a Hollow. Once they have their new powers, they’ll be able to progress them as if they
were truly inherent abilities. "
259,400,Shinigami Influencer,Bleach,Providence,"Within the Shinigami ranks, the order of authority goes from the top with the Captain Commander
and second behind him: the Shinigami Women’s Association. It’s no joke the influence those women
have on the running of the military, despite ostensibly being a club for the female officers to spend
leisure time in. As President Yachiru managed, you can also gather frankly bizarre amounts of
influence within larger organisations. Gathering other members of the same group under the banner
of your own smaller faction is easy, especially when they share some major quality with you. Sex or
similar bloodthirst or even noble birth.

These groups you form invariably consider you their rightful leader and methods to exert influence
on the rest of the organisation naturally present themselves to you. Despite this supposedly being a
military with a strict hierarchy, you’ll find ways to leverage the people and resource you gain into
getting your way with almost anything. Yachiru had secret bases carved out even under Noble
houses, a high amount of influence over the Shinigami media and effective free reign over the
budget outside of critical military expenditure. You won’t be able to overtake the full group with this
alone but it certainly can put you as a politically important figure in a few years. "
260,400,Divine Aura,Bleach,Providence,"In every action, others find meaning. With every word you speak, others see wisdom. The fools and
the faithful gather like flies around the last light, desperate without realising to find the divine in you. Should you not take action to stop it, many people susceptible to a cult-like mentality are drawn to you as a central figure. From those not clever enough to see past the lies to people so in need of
faith that they choose to see what they want in your actions, it takes very little for you to turn
ordinary people and even some quite gifted folk into fanatical followers. Of yourself or a greater
faction that you come to represent in the eyes of the faithful. The sort of fanaticism that’d both kill
and die in your name.

These faithful can even share a small portion of this supposedly divine inspiration, helping them
convince others to join and allowing for a shocking rate of expansion. Those of strong beliefs already
or who are not the sort to consider such feelings won’t be affected but much of the time, you’ll find
yourself in the company of people looking for someone to believe in. "
261,400,Wait for Winter,Bleach,Providence,"This world has an ancient history, with powerful beings having established themselves for millennia
or longer. How can an ambitious young villain hope to survive the weight of such preparation? By
being underestimated. Even despite the power and presence you might have, you know how to get
your enemies to drag their feet. Be it the way you present yourself or how you present your plans in
motion to the spying eyes of your enemies, you’re able to diminish the threat and urgency others
feel from your actions. Even after going public, all but the foes who have a personal grudge against
you tend to slack off and move at a sluggish pace. Despite the potent threat he posed, the Shinigami
were willing to wait for months to battle Aizen and few underwent harsh training in that time.

Your skills are sharpest when it comes to those in the greatest positions of power and influence, helping you defer their interference until you are ready. For all his wisdom and clairvoyant sight, Ichibe the Monk would delay and delay until almost too late his personal involvement, even if your
plans posed a clear and credible danger to the cycle of reincarnation. "
262,400,For Two-Thousand Years,Bleach,Providence,"Beneath all the tradition and flair, the Shinigami and Quincy aren’t all that different from Hollows. They’re all bloodthirsty warriors, bound together by powerful leaders, into marauding tribes that
take what they want because they have the power. Being one of the warlords that commands these
people takes a lot and you’re one of the few that can match the task. You inspire intense loyalty in those that follow you and you’re exceptional at recruiting those that
don’t already serve. Even a medley of murderous villains and charitable saints can be forged into a
cooperative, even close-knit, team under your steady guidance. Commanding them all, from a dozen
mighty Captains to the full thousands of lesser soldiers in your army, is a simple matter. Both
strategic and tactical matters are clear to you, though you perform best at matching up individuals
with their most suitable opponents. As you continue to rule and impress a greater fealty onto your men, you’ll become like a symbol to
them. Many will likely be affected by your style of leadership, a strict commander increasing discipline in all his forces and a laidback king cooling heated tempers across the nation. If you
happen to take the frontlines yourself after they’ve come to see you as a symbol, you’ll find your
presence empowers them to greater heights. Their will to survive and live up to your expectations
pushes them further than they thought possible. "
263,400,Cockroach King,Jujutsu Kaisen,Providence,"Gojo had a rather bad time when he first fought Toji Fushiguro. Stabbed through the throat and left riddled with deep wounds across his body, he was left to bleed out and die, completely defeated. Yet the strongest of sorcerers survived due to two factors: the first was an epiphany on how reverse cursed techniques worked, allowing him to heal his wounds. The other was Toji’s failure to make sure he finished the job, thinking that the lethal wounds he dealt would be enough.

You have a similar sort of luck to Gojo; somehow, you have an uncanny knack for surviving scenarios that really should have spelled your end. Your opponents frequently forget to do their due diligence in making sure you’re truly dead, giving you a chance to escape or recover. Even injuries that should be lethal may turn out to have instead just barely missed your vitals, incapacitating but not quite killing you. Though this protection isn’t absolute – an opponent who defeated you once is likely to do a better job confirming their kill the second time around, and some attacks might be too powerful for survival to be a possibility – it’s enough to get out of a sticky situation every once in a while, at least."
264,400,Broken Seal ,Jujutsu Kaisen,Providence,"Sometimes, there comes along an opponent who cannot be defeated through normal means. One who stands so far above others that he’s quite literally untouchable. When such an individual comes along, there are often only two methods to deal with them: to find someone as strong or stronger than them to take them down, or to seal them away. The latter option was the method of choice used by Kenjaku during the Shibuya Incident to deal with Satoru Gojo, the greatest threat to his plans.

While you’re not totally immune to such effects, with this perk you’ll find that attempts to seal, imprison, or otherwise cause you long-term incapacitation without killing you are much less effective than normal. Weaker attempts to take you down in such manners fail outright, while even stronger attempts are far more temporary than they should be. Perhaps your allies find just the tools or techniques needed to set you free, or maybe the bonds holding you conveniently begin to weaken over time. Whatever the case, you’ll find that even the very strongest of seals can’t hold you for long – it’s never a matter of if you’ll escape, but when."
265,400,True To Myself ,Tsukihime,Providence,"It doesn’t matter what others think of you.The Clock Tower, your own family, or even sane and rational individuals who balk at youractions. All that matters is that you’re true to what you want to be and what you want to do. Nothing can make you betray your nature unwillingly - mind control, persuasion, and more simply cannot touch your personality and your decision-making process. Also, so long as you don't make the choice to betray what you see as your true nature or what you see as right,consequences for your decisions simply...roll off of you. Causing trouble and death in a city by trying to claim a familiar? Water under the bridge. Drastically shorten humanity's already-declining time on this Earth to save someone’s life? No one thinks to bring it up after the act. This won’t stop those you wrong or harm from personally retaliating, but the long-term consequences...far away in the future you won’t be present for, out of sight and out of mind.
"
266,400,Aftermath Survivor,The God of High School Jump,Providence,"Some pretty crazy battles go on around here. Even early on in the big tournament you’re entered in, people seem to be busting up the stage and the audience seats as they please. Later on there’ll be fights that bring the entire planet to the breaking point and whole countries will get wiped clean. A girl could really get lost and killed in all the confusion, if she weren’t as lucky as you. Long as you’re not a direct combatant or a target of any side in the fight, you’re just obscenely lucky in regards to getting out unscathed. People decide to chuck mountains at each other? The rubble always lands just a bit to the side of you, while never trapping you forever in some cave. People decide to blow up the Sage Realm? If you leg it really fast, you’ll be able to get to the portal that opened up just a bit near your position, instead of where it would normally open. Of course, if no one was going to open a portal in the first place, it won’t appear near you either. There’s only so far you can abuse your luck and if there’s really no way out of turning into collateral, it’d be best to start your prayers."
267,400,Against All Odds,RWBY,Providence,"Standing against the never-ending hordes of Grimm would be a death sentence for normal man. Good thing you aren’t. You are a Huntsman, the very embodiment of Quality beats Quantity. Sure the Grimm may come wave after wave but that doesn’t have to stop you. No matter how many enemies you are fighting, if you are capable of defeating each of them individually, they will have no more luck teaming up on you."
268,400,Born of Troy,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Providence,"Heroes are the ones that go out and conquer the villains, right? To those that say the heroes are the ones that act, you only need to look towards Troy to see just what a hero with a defensive mindset can really do. So long as you’re on the defense, you’ll be doing a lot better than anyone could expect. Your combat-related abilities and skills heighten enormously provided you fight defensively, on a local level or when leading entire armies. You could lock an army ten times the size of your force and led by the greatest of divine heroes down for a decade without much issue should you bunker down in a strong fortress with a good army or, provided you’re a fair bit beyond the average man already, give a good fight to one of the demigod heroes that roam the land. It’s handy that you yourself are indeed beyond the average man. While your physical abilities may be sorely lacking compared to the usual demigod breed, your skills in combat are enough to give even the mighty Achilles pause even when on the offense. "
269,400,Heavenly Scorn,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Providence,"Those who are left to support the household are far from helpless. It is not for nothing that arts like Kalaripayattu trained both men and women in it’s style and the wrath of a mother whose child is in danger is legendary. Your nature is the same now, when those you love are in danger. In those situations, you’ll find that your powers grow greater and greater the worse that danger is, provided you’re close enough to act in their defence at all. It’s a noticeable boost, perhaps even enough to double your normal strength if their lives are at risk, but you can force this further with the sacrifice of parts of yourself. The more valuable the part you permanently burn off, the greater the boost. Some of your blood might only be a brief but notable burst while a limb could result in several times as much strength for hours until every enemy has been beaten down. Something as integral and vital as your very divinity could bring you to the strength of the greatest of gods for a time, as Parvati herself once showed in her rage. The permanent nature of this sacrifice means that you will be unable to heal it on your own and that even others with enough power to match you will find it a far more difficult task, though not impossible. 

In a less dire method, you can instead heal the wounds and fatigue of other people by letting them partake of your body. These are temporary wounds, such as letting someone supp at your bodily fluids like blood, or a bite of your flesh. Even a few drops of blood would heal most mortal wounds and a slice of flesh could undo even crippling wounds to the entire body and unholy curses. These wounds will never kill you when given for the purpose of this ability, within reason, and slowly heal over a day or two."
270,400,Heroic Power        ,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Providence,"While some endowed with great strength give off a brutal atmosphere, others are more in line with great protectors of the people. Your noble heart shines through your body, with bulging muscles and power to match any berserking beast. Your natural strength could smash great boats in two and is exceptionally useful for your new style of fighting, the use of the noble bow. Even with a crudely made bow, your strength greatly magnifies the power of your shots without damaging the flimsy tool in your hands. You’ve got enough skill to make distant shots on stormy seas in the midst of naval battles as well and your arrows have a peculiar ability to pin down enemies, piercing bone and rock beneath it while remaining far more difficult to remove than should be possible. 

Your physical strength has also drawn a bright and vital aura around your being, making others feel warm and healthy when in your presence. It’s easy to make friends with this and that aura will grow as your physical strength does, potentially even letting you show terrible monsters the path to friendship and heroism."
271,400,Protection of Andraste,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Providence,"Who could lose when they have the favour of their goddess at their backs? As much as your enemy
may claim to be favoured by their own false gods, you’ll both become well aware of who truly
benefits, as divine power surges through the bodies of you and your men. Blessed by Victory itself, you and armies you lead gain great benefits when in battle. All parameters, physical and magical, are
raised noticeably once the battle is adjoined. This is strongest with yourself, your followers receiving
a smaller portion of the benefit. At a normal level, it would unbalance an equal fight but not so much
as to make it impossible for your enemy to win. When fighting a defensive battle, this boost
improves greatly. A battle of equals becomes a battle between elite soldiers and seemingly green
troops, terrified of their first fight. You and those who follow you gain reinforced willpower and
unnatural vitality, withstanding terrible wounds yet continuing to fight. All the ingredients needed to
turn a wild horde of tribesmen into a force that can crush even a Roman legion in battle. "
272,400,Child of the Stars,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Providence,"It is only unnatural that you are who you are. An outsider to any world you go to. Apparently, some
other beings in this world can sympathise. You’ve found yourself beloved by the eldritch beings that
hail from outside reality, the gribbly things in the cracks of space-time and the monstrous gods that
do not exist yet continue to act. This is to the point that lesser such beings and creatures of the
mythos often act as loyal and quite cuddly pets to you while the senior ones, such as the Old Ones or
other higher beings, usually dote on you as older siblings or parents might, protecting you when they
notice you in danger or leaving little helping gifts in your path. Those you specifically anger, while
difficult to do so, will ignore this mostly and they, unless you befriend them more, usually do not
make extreme efforts for you without reason. Of course, while this affection can bring great boons,
it can also bring great danger. The minds of these beings are often strange even in regards to the
weak creatures, much less the ancient and unknowable outer beings, so their gifts may seem more
like threats or danger, though rarely would it be without a silver lining."
273,400,Prophecy of Divine Return,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Providence,"Gods are rarely slain in legends. Least of all by mere mortal beings. Even when a god is laid low, the
common myth is that their return to greatness is prophesised, for good or ill. Your return to
greatness is similarly fated, at least in part, for whenever you are diminished, you find yourself
eventually returning to power. Should you be weakened, harmed, crippled or even killed, you will
find yourself provided with at least one chance to return to your state before the act was done to
you. Provided you can take that chance that clearly provides itself to you and are not interrupted. You may be fated to return but that fate can be broken and if such is done, it cannot be used again
for the same thing. Should someone re-harm a supernaturally crippled arm of yours before you can
use this chance to heal it, this power will not provide another chance for you. This power does
however, work on more than just physical injuries. Losing wealth, social positions, material objects
or even loved ones can all be affected. While you are in the chain, should you fail to return from
death by succesfully grasping the chance presented to you, it will count as a final death unless you
possess something else to mitigate death once more."
274,400,Fairy Blessed,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Providence,"It’s a rare man that gets the attention of the Fae and even rarer for that attention to be as positive
as what you receive. From your handsome face to your caring heart to just a smell about you, fairies
of all different kinds find that they can’t help but adore you and being around you. Not only are they
almost never violent with you without serious provocation but they are almost eager to become
friends with you and help you out. They can make for powerful allies and unlike most people, are
quite helpful with you if you should attempt to navigate their byzantine rules and tricks. One might
even say their pranks truly are good natured with you, rather then the sadistic tricks they do to
others. Past this fairy love, you have also received a blessing of great luck from the fae race, one that
applies in battle alone. This luck blessing is quite powerful, allowing you to defeat foes you should
normally struggle greatly against with relative easy for most of the time. It is fickle, a fairy blessing is
given by fairies after all, but by relying on your own skills as well, you can find yourself scything
through entire ranks of the enemy like a flash."
275,400,Murderous Brawler,Fate/Legends - God Save the Queen,Providence,"Surrounded by a dozen ships of the line, hundreds of pirates pouring onto your flagship, your crew dying in droves around you? You’ve never felt the blood pump harder in your ears nor moved with such lethal speed. They think they’re going to easily win but they don’t yet realise that the worse off you are, the deadlier you become. Already, you’ve been made one of the most dangerous men or women on the seven seas with a blade or gun or both. Firing through a captain’s eye from half a mile away in the middle of a ship battle as a hurricane rages above? You barely had to aim. Ten expert duelists surrounding you from all angles, as you wield naught but a short sword? They’ll be mewling on the ground, clutching fatal wounds in less than a minute!

The chaos of battle only benefits you, hardly hindering your awareness of your surroundings and revealing to you all the ways to take advantage. Makeshift weapons leap out to your sight, the crush of crowded bodies limiting only your opponents agility and errant fire from surrounding battles is easy to misdirect into your enemy. Most potent of all, you find yourself moving with greater power, speed and skill the worse the battle is going for your side. The greater you are disavantaged, the more damaging your own returning fire. Both you and the ship you command find this benefit, allowing you to tear your way through overwhelming odds and escape, or even manage to win battles that by all rights you should have died miserably in. A cornered pirate is no different than a cornered rat, they’re just at their nastiest and most violent point. "
276,400,Escort Duty,Chrome Shelled Regios,Providence,"As a mercenary you will have to protect and escort individuals from time to time, or even protect your loved ones on missions. You never have to worry about them being targets as long as you or your people are present. You and members of your team will always be targets before anyone you are protecting or care about are in danger."
277,400,Blessed with Fortune,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"There are a number of factors that can be used to determine the strength of an individual. One of the more mysterious factors is luck. This perk grants you luck on par with the best children of heaven. Whether it's your luck in general or finding ancient inheritances it truly shines brightly. Similarly anything that relies on chance such as the Flatbread of Primeval Chaos will be far more beneficial. For example, you would be far more likely to receive permanent abilities and to gain stronger abilities from consuming it. Other opportunities and events that are reliant on the user’s luck will be affected similarly."
278,400,It’s a Treasure so What,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"Amongst the various issues that can occur in a cultivation world, jealousy is one of the worst. This perk protects you from this jealousy. You will never have to worry about anyone coming after you because they want to take your treasures again. This won’t stop them from coming after you for other reasons or to trade with you, but you now can own valuable items without worrying about thieves.
"
279,400,Time to Develop,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"Truthfully there are an innumerable amount of talented geniuses that exist; the rare cases are the ones who survive long enough to grow. You have been blessed with the ability to survive. You seem to constantly dance on the brink of death only narrowing avoiding the edge. Circumstances will practically line up giving you a chance. Maybe an expert that would normally attempt to kill you would be in a good mood and ignore you instead. Perhaps your teacher will arrive at the last moment to protect you. Regardless as long as you aren’t blatantly suicidal then you will be able to avoid numerous deadly situations. Just don’t abuse this, eventually your luck may run out if you have nothing else to rely on. 
"
280,400,Let It End Here,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"One of the most common tropes in cultivation worlds is that every minor weakling you kill will somehow be related to someone stronger. This cycle will occur repeatedly causing a minor dispute to evolve into a life and death feud with an entire sect. What if this didn’t occur though. Well that is exactly what this perk does, taking it makes it so that any issues you have will be resolved with their target. For example if you got into a feud with an arrogant young master and killed them you would be able to avoid the wrath of their family. The justification of this could vary on a case by case basis. Perhaps their family didn’t care about them or they were already slated for death due to a crime they committed. 
"
281,400,My Restaurant My Rules,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"You are capable of setting specific rules within businesses and properties you own. This could include things such as a customer only being allowed a dish a single time, or something simpler such as no fighting inside the restaurant. Anyone who comes inside will be compelled to obey these rules. Even if they are dozens of times stronger than you they will abide by them within your territory. 
"
282,400,You Cannot Flee,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"While some will fight to the end others will not hesitate to flee once they realize that they cannot win. This can sometimes cause issues by allowing a powerful foe to retreat or for them to have gained information on you. This perk grants you two main effects. First you become much more capable when it comes to restraining yours and locking them down. Even if you can’t beat them they won’t be able to run. Second, for one reason or another your opponents will have a much harder time running away. Maybe an internal injury will suddenly spike stopping them from retreating or an ally will show up out of nowhere launching an ambush. Regardless, anyone who tries to flee will have a far more difficult time doing so and even if they somehow do they will have to pay a truly horrifying price to escape. "
283,400,Elder With An 8-Pack,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"One of the elders who guarded the Shura City Saintess possessed a unique ability. The longer he fought someone the greater his might. The only way to defeat him was to kill him quickly like Nethery did before he became too strong. You share this ability the longer a fight goes on the stronger you become. For example you could be fighting someone stronger than you and be losing badly. If you last long enough however you will not only be able to fight on even grounds, but eventually you will become stronger than your opponent. This effect will slowly wear off once you have calmed down. Lastly there are no negative side effects so you don’t have to worry about ending up in a coma or something similar. 
"
284,400,Wisdom From Every Well,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"You have a knack to get people to teach you things. This isn’t being taught
Qi techniques or anything like that, this is lessons on how to live your best
life. Hard won life lessons will flow to you far more easily than those who
suffered to learn them. Which given how Cultivation works here will
inevitably end up making you stronger and unlock new Qi techniques
simply through living virtuously. But hey, the vast improvements to your
quality of life ain’t bad either. And once you’ve learned a lesson, well
teaching it isn’t a major step now is it?"
285,400,Divine Godly Deity’s Beast Taming Method,Against The Gods,Providence,"This world abounds with Profound Beasts,
and not entirely because of their own power. As it happens, these beasts can be useful too.
You have incredible skill when it comes to taming these beasts, whether through bribing them with
food, subordinating their will with force, or any other means. You know just how to stimulate them,
just what they like, their habitats... and what you don’t know, you can learn very quickly.
Not just this, but you find that once tamed, your tamed beasts almost never rebel, peacefully
working your will for as long as you want them to, barring extreme mistreatment."
286,400,Dedication of the Student,Cradle,Providence,"All of the benefits that come from training, be it your mind,
spirit, or body, are not only doubled, but training your magic will make your body stronger, and
vis versa, though not at the same rate as if you'd been directly focusing on it. You can keep your
muscle mass even while doing nothing but sitting lotus position and cultivating, or do nothing but
body-weight exercises to maintain your magical strength."
287,400,Uncanny,Cradle,Providence,"Something about the way you move, the way you plan, always manages to
grasp opportunity from the jaws of defeat. Every downside has an upside, every arrow fired at
you has a position that will allow you to avoid it. Your mind and body both have a strange ability
to dodge risk while seeking reward. It's far from perfect, but if you hone it, and use it in concert
with some of your other abilities, it can become fearsome indeed."
288,400,Awe-Inspiring,Cradle,Providence,"Never find yourself questioned as a leader again. Your rule is
absolute, your orders firm and clearly received. When you tell someone to jump, they ask how
high, even if they met you five minutes ago. This works even if you're only on an equal playing
field with your allies, but it's especially powerful when there's a clear gap in skill or strength
between you and your cohorts."
289,400,Main Character Syndrome,World Seed,Providence,"It looks like you’ve been blessed by the God of Stories, also known as Author-sama. The exact
benefit this gives you is what seems like an inability to die, at least through your own stupidity.
No matter what you do, whether that is doing brain surgery on yourself without anesthesia or
deciding to fight a bear by catapulting yourself head-first at it, you won’t experience any
negative consequences from it. Either you simply happen to accidentally do what you need to
do to survive, dumb luck saves you, a friend, acquaintance, or even a total stranger decides to
protect you from yourself, or maybe a higher being decides that enough is enough and
intervenes. As long as you don’t deliberately commit suicide yourself, none of your own actions
may harm you.

A lesser version of this effect even protects you against whatever your enemies might do to you.
Their shots seem to miss one after another, they underestimate your strength and pay the price
for it, most mooks going after you act like total morons (even more than the usual mooks,
really), and if your ship blows up, you’ll be sure to find the only escape pod that won’t be shot
down. But while your luck will do its best to save you, if an enemy still finds themselves standing
before you after being bombarded by coincidences left and right, and drives their sword into
your heart, well, there’s not much it can do. At least not more than one time, that is. Once per
jump, should you experience critical existence failure without your explicit consent,
circumstances will arrange themselves to revive you at the earliest convenient time. But an
enemy who managed to get through your defences one time will most likely manage to do it yet
again, unless you change your strategy, and should that happen, not even all the luck in the
world will save you."
290,400,But teach a man to fish...,World Seed,Providence,"Skills in the system are created through the memory and repetition of using them (or in the case
of Quest rewards, simply put into your mind). What this means is that having a skill is not always
a permanent thing. Say you learn Archery at the start of your journey, but soon switch to using
more advanced plasma weapons, and don’t really need or use bows anymore. Because you
never studied archery enough to develop habits and didn't keep practicing, your skill proficiency
would slowly drop over time, until eventually you might lose the skill entirely.
Of course, there is nothing stopping you from simply learning archery again, but it’d still be a
hassle. Thankfully, it’s one you’ll never have to deal with. Any skills you learn and any memories
you make will stay with you forever. Never forget how to use that obscure spell you really need
right now ever again! You could sit on your ass for a few decades, but when an enemy shows
up you need to defeat, you’d still be the combat monster you’ve been in your prime. Or rather,
you ARE in your prime. After all, for you it never ended in the first place. This also means that
no matter how many memories you might accumulate, you’ll be able to recall any of them in an
instant."
291,400,Edge of Death,Dragon Ball,Providence,"Fighting life and death battles is one of the most common ways to grow stronger quickly.
You in particular are well suited to this strategy. Whenever you are pushed to your
utmost limits your strength will rapidly grow. This boost generally, however, will only be a
few percent. Though if you are truly pushed to your limits then you may end up growing
a couple percent stronger every minute. The best part of this power however, is that this
boost is permanent. Meaning that after the battle concludes you will retain all of the new
strength that you’ve received."
292,400,Innocent Spirit,Dragon Ball,Providence,"Goku is primarily known for his strength. He however, also possesses a pure and
innocent heart. This aspect allowed Goku to turn his enemies into allies, repeatedly
break through his limits, and remove distracting thoughts. By taking this perk you can
acquire a similar spirit gaining a number of benefits. First, as mentioned before you will
be able to befriend your allies. Anyone you defeat will find themselves seeking your
company.

They may be rude, but they will not make any moves against you. Over time you will
find that many will be purified, gaining virtues similar to yours. The second effect is that
your mind will remain unburdened. You will never be weighed down by regrets,
hesitation, or what some refer to as Heart Demons. Lastly, this will also make you an
acceptable user for sentient or picky artifacts. For example, you could use the Nimbus
Cloud from this world or other relics like Excalibur."
293,400,Those Who Exist in Jumper’s Memories,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"Cannot have their Karma severed by the Heavens of the Ji clan. Or any other clan, for that
matter. Your nature as a being beyond worlds grants you a very real power now. You are an
anchor, an immovable pole around which the waves of reality and unreality must maneuver,
because nothing can move you directly.
While this does nothing to protect you from having a direct attack destroy you or a monster eat
your face, you’re entirely and absolutely immune to attacks that target your karma, or ones that
try to destroy you by rewriting the universe, or erasing your concept, or something like that.
Not just that, though. While you yourself are immune, you can also lend this out as a kind of...
resistance, to others, limited only by the power differential between you and the attacker. You
can protect any number of people from anyone weaker than you or your equal, and even
people only a little stronger than you. But when it comes to people dramatically more powerful
than you, the bigger the difference the fewer the number of people you can protect thusly."
294,400,Fate,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"Love him or hate him, one has to appreciate that there’s something funky going on with that
Meng Hao. From coming across priceless, utterly unique items in what’s basically the Sect’s
trash heaps to making friends, enemies and would-be lovers out of exceptional people left and
right, Fate’s touch is on him in a very special way.
Just the same way as with you, actually! You now have the same kind of fortune and luck as the
protagonist of the story, with everything that that entails. Wherever you go, opportunities for
adventures and profit blossom. The things you do may be good, or bad, but they’re never
boring. You come across the most beautiful women, the worst enemies and the best friends.
Simulations of the past can end up with actual effects on history when you’re around, and the
universe basically holds its breath when you’re not!
And even beyond those things this fortune and luck means that you will occasionally run into
opportunities that most people wouldn’t encounter if they waited a billion lives. If you were
capable enough to take advantage of them those opportunities would quickly catapult you well
past the level of your peers and beyond.

This final effect also applies, though to a much lesser extent, to those who share a positive
connection to you. Similar to how the moon reflects the light of the sun, your friends and loved
ones will have the opportunities they need to grow enough to at least contribute in some minor
way to your current challenges."
295,400,"I’m Lord Jumper, Bitch!",I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"Not for you, the solemnity and decorum of a veteran cultivator. You find that shame and
manners are things that only ever hold you back. With this perk, the more outrageous, hammy
and just plain loud you act, the more powerful you become.
This isn’t a permanent powerup, growing as you continue to act out and receding when you
stop, but the more funny, ridiculous and absurd your behaviour, the more powerful you
become, ad infinitum.
Of course, there are ‘types’ of outrageous behaviour. But while this procs for basically all kinds
of it, you find that relatively ‘harmless’ forms serve you the best. That is, this isn’t a perk for
getting berserker powerups. Can’t make people cringe if you kill them, after all."
296,400,Attention Magnet,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"The only thing worse than lacking talent is having it but never been recognized for it. Elders
with vested interests, arrogant seniors or just the twist of fate has prevented many a rare seed
from being recognized for themselves and being nurtured.
Nor a concern you need to have. You find that your superiors and seniors always tend to view
you with extremely benign eyes, even when they shouldn’t. Any talent you have is rapidly
recognized, and people all but line up to give you the resources to properly develop and harness
it.
Rewards, favorable treatment and opportunities for advancement shower upon you, so long as
you maintain even a modicum of humility and respectful treatment for your patrons. Wherever
you go, unless you set out to pick a fight, the Old Monsters of the world seem to come to see
you as a favored grandchild, doing everything they can, within reason, to help you along.
This doesn’t just apply to ‘normal’ cultivators, mind you. Long-gone shades, gods of different
worlds, ancient nation-sized monster turtles and grand beasts... somehow they all like you to
weird extents."
297,400,Sowing Karma,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"In this world, karma is a tangible force that has effects on the world. Some cultivators, the Ji
Clan being most prominent, are capable of manipulating this force to achieve various ends. You
don’t have any innate ability to manipulate karma, at least not with just this, but instead have
the ability to ensure that when debts are incurred to you, they’re acknowledged not only by
your debtors but also the Universe.
Whenever your actions benefit another, threads of karma will be formed that denote their debt
to you. They will instinctively recognize this and be aware of the need to repay you, and in
general make a good faith effort to repay you as best as they can.
If they don’t repay you in a timely manner then they’ll find themselves suffering increasingly
drastic bouts of bad luck. These spells of bad luck will inevitably benefit you, as well.
And even if they don’t, debts owed to you always have metaphysical components that you can
draw upon as soon as you learn how."
298,400,Stable Presence,A Will Eternal,Providence,"A common problem with the higher levels of cultivation is the ability for the world to handle
your sheer power. Some of the most powerful cultivators are unable to harness their full
power in battle simply because the world around them would not be able to take it. The
power you exude is different from theirs though. In fact, it does just the opposite. Your power
actually stabilises the world around you, letting you exist at a level that should have
previously been impossible unrestrained."
299,400,Internal Affairs,A Will Eternal,Providence,"Sometimes in cultivation you will come across road blocks. Bottlenecks. Your progression
will just halt, and you will be unable to grow further in your skills or cultivation without some
form of help. Sometimes it is basically impossible to advance to the next level without
outside interference. This outside factor can even be unique or location specific, meaning
that should you miss the chance you will be unable to progress further naturally. This perk
will turn those insurmountable roadblocks into merely steep mountains. With hard, dedicated
work, you will be able to break through and continue progressing. This may even take years,
but it can be done with sufficient hard work. This does, however, require there to be a higher
level to progress to in the first place."
300,400,With The Flick Of A Wrist...,A Will Eternal,Providence,"... You gain a harem. One way or another, powerful women (or males as the case may be)
seem to gather around you. Feeling will start to bud and develop within their heart as they
witness your actions, for your audacity sometimes if nothing else. This effect seems most
pronounced among women that start out as your enemies. Quickly people who were vying
for your blood find themselves unable to deliver that final killing blow, as flashes of
tenderness replace bloodlust. This does presume that you aren’t actively trying to piss them
off though."
301,400,The Unlikeliest of Friends,Generic Exalted,Providence,"You are the glue which holds the group together. The heart
of the team, the one that everyone turns to when they are hurting, and the one that everyone
can count on to be the rock around which the others are tethered. Disparate personalities and
customs can exist and indeed excel alongside one another so long as you are there to act as
the medium between them.
A Solar, a Bronze-Faction Sidereal, and an Abyssal walking into a bar might sound like the
opening to a bad joke if anyone else said it, but if it was you that was speaking it might very well
be an event that actually happened, one that ended peaceably at that."
302,400,Credulity Straining Charisma Formation,Generic Exalted,Providence,"You are incredibly likable. Everyone wants to
be your friend, or at least wouldn’t mind being your friend if you showed an inclination to being
friends with them. Your superiors tend to show you some fairly blatant favoritism and you’re
more likely to be selected as the right-hand of someone truly powerful (politically, personally,
socially, or otherwise) than you are to draw their ire.
Shrewd business cunning? Why that Guild Factor sees a little bit of his younger self in you, and
will take you in as his protege rather than have you killed or run out of town as competition. One
of the Chosen of the Sun challenged you to battle and you lost? Why naturally that was just the
interview to be their new lieutenant, and all you need to do is settle in to your new post. Nine
times out of ten unless the other person has a serious predisposition to not liking you they will
invariably view you as they might a friendly acquaintance or, if you actually know and get along
with them, then as a long time and close friend. So long as you don’t do anything to jeopardize
that friendship (that they discover at any rate) such feelings will continue, even if they haven’t
seen you for a while."
303,400,A Gilded Throne,Generic Exalted,Providence,"You were born and destined to lead and, indeed, you were Exalted for
it. Any army or group you lead will share in some small manner a portion of your own brilliance.
If you are possessed of supernatural strength, toughness, or intelligence then even the least of
the soldiers in your army will find themselves to be possessed of similar qualities at the limit of
what a member of their race could achieve and, with time and effort on your part, might even
manage to surpass it. Logistics and finances for your organizations are easy and seem destined
to work out in your favor, and further any attempts to stall or hinder your organization find
themselves stymied on all fronts, concerted efforts being required to see any sort of results in
slowing your forces.
Finally those that work for you will be possessed of increased morale and will never suffer from
lethargy, certain that by working for your cause they are being part of something great. This
perk only works for organizations that you personally, and openly, lead. You must sit on the
Throne to benefit from it, not scheme from behind it."
304,400,The Fog of Legend,Solars Exalted,Providence,"It is easy for the Chosen to step into the spotlight of destiny. To
defeat the Darkness and push back their foes, and to let themselves be heard and hailed as the
heroes they are. But, sometimes, it is better to let go. It is better to let those whose lives have
been changed to continue on without you - you are, after all, a wanderer of worlds. Thus, when
you undertake a great accomplishment or complete a heroic quest, you may quietly walk off into
the distance (sunset optional) and allow your accomplishments to fade away as a legend, as a
myth. Your deeds are attributed to the closest possible substitute or a figure that doesn’t quite
match your description, and your reputation quickly fades into obscurity. Though your closest
allies and greatest enemies will remember it was you who made history, you may let yourself
become just another face on the road, and march on to your next quest in peace."
305,400,Acts of Villainy,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"While the Torment of the Green Sun Princes makes it quite clear when an Infernal strays
from their purpose, they alone may alleviate this burden, unlike their Cursed cousins. For
when an Infernal performs certain actions pleasing to the Yozis, actions that many
Creation-born might view as acts of great villainy, they could reduce or even eliminate their
building Torment. It is interesting then, that these acts shall still please the Yozi and be
rewarded... even if they betray the goals of the Yozi and work against the plans of the
Reclamation. In this way, one could be a beloved subject of the demon princes, while doing
everything to help your assigned ""enemies"".
Perhaps you captured them, before giving a diabolic monologue explaining your plans to
provide food to the starving orphans in the city as a first step to corrupting Creation and
starting the Reclamation. Perhaps you left the spy you were assigned to kill in a elaborate
deathtrap, but ""failed"" to eliminate the obvious escape routes as you left them to their slow
fate. These and many more are your options, and you will find acting out these villainous
acts shall give you much more leniency than it would anyone else. After all, none could
compare to your obvious evil. Even in other worlds, those of a villainous persuasion can be
charmed quite easily by such acts. Yet curiously, your enemies seem almost friendly, as they
keep mentioning that they know what side you're really on..."
306,400,That Twists The Sky,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"GNAT. YOUR TINY, WEAK SELF DANCES ALONG THE PUPPET STRINGS OF FATE
AND YOUR BETTERS.
FIGHT.
STAND UP. WREST THE STARS FROM THE SKY. BREAK THEIR LIMITS. TWIST THE
PROPHECIES OF THOSE WHO WOULD DARE TO RESTRICT YOU. TAKE YOUR
FREEDOM, AND GO FORTH TO SHATTER THE FATES OF ALL WHO WOULD GAINSAY
YOU. NO FATE CAN HOLD YOU, AND YOUR TOUCH DESTROYS THE DESTINIES OF
ALL OTHERS. STANDING FIRM AGAINST PROPHECY, YOU CAN EXTEND YOUR
NATURE AS A BEING OUTSIDE FATE TO THOSE YOU WISH. GO FORTH,
FATE-BREAKER.
Again, I shall explain my liege? As one of the Princes of the Green Sun you do, of course,
already stand outside fate. But now you will also be extremely resistant to effects that would
force you back under fate’s sway, and gain the ability to bring others outside fate."
307,400,Mu,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"When Oramus’ dreams are fitful, Wyld-light shines around and through him. Then he takes
forms other than his own, as many and varied as all the facets of those things which could
never be. He might appear as an opalesque temple with seven minarets; a cyclopean
lantern burning with seven varicolored flames; a seven-sailed galleon of blue wood and
starmetal, chained to an anchor carved from a single pearl; a titanic snow white bird with
seven broken wings.
All those are Oramus and not Oramus, for he is The Dragon Beyond the World and looks
always to be the thing which he is not. Likewise, you may shine the Wyld-light of Beyond
though yourself and take on such varied forms. Unfortunately, you cannot yet fully
encompass those things that are Beyond, and as such these are mere seemings that do not
change your nature or abilities... Not that anyone else would know. For you are protected
from any information gathering by charm, spell, or any other supernatural ability that might
be used to gain information about you. All these will instead simply answer with results that
do fit the question appropriately, yet do not describe your actual state. With some practise
you could even tailor the replies, if you are aware of them."
308,400,Mother of Creation,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"Theory is all that remains of the Exalted host’s understanding of Cytherea. The truth
regarding her secrets has yet to be won. Still, many of the legends Exalted scholars once
collected point towards the same direction. A creator and inventor by breed, just as the other
Primordials were, but hers was the imbuing and purifying Essence. It was her who provided
Gaia’s Essence with the substance to spin Creation out of the Wyld. It was her who strained
to purify the purest of the Primordial King’s flames into a new and white flame, hotter than
even her king could stand, which would become the fires of the Daystar itself. It was her who
worked with Oramus to bestow upon Luna her ever-evolving, indomitable urge.
So too will you be a force to imbue and and purify, to raise up the efforts of others to new
heights unseen on their own. With your help, the meek shall become mighty and the mighty
shall become transcendent. This ability shines brightest in the creation of all things, such that
craftsmen and sorcerers alike would all but beg for your aid. You shall become the muse,
your power the amplification of the might and efforts of others into something far more than
they could ever achieve on their own."
309,400,Can’t Keep Me Down,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"The Yozi are broken. Transformed by defeat, shock and the murders of their component
souls, they have been mutilated and lessened by the might of the Exalted. Crippled as they
are, they have deliberately been made unable to ever recover from the terrible traumas in
mind and spirit they have suffered, their impotent hatred and rage now written in their very
nature.
Unlike them, you shall never fall to a fate as terrible as this. No matter how you are broken,
how terribly you are mutilated, how incurable the damage, how great the curses to prevent
you from recovering, or how many other complications are brought forth to keep you
mangled... your mind and soul shall ever find a way to recover from even the worst of
abuses, mental issues, and traumas. Your mental state shall always improve, and never
stagnate in anguish or deteriorate naturally.
Look upon my deeds, and deny your enemies the same."
310,400,Indolent Masquerade,Abyssals Exalted,Providence,"Most Deathlords view the Lover Clad in the Raiment of Tears merely as a whore and a
dilettante, though one not quite as incompetent as Eye and Seven Despairs. Now and then,
she trifles at destroying a petty kingdom or a legion on the march. Her critics wonder
whether she will ever do anything important to further the Neverborn’s goals. Only the
Bodhisattva does not share that view, for he remembers the Lover from their living days.
Remembers her and fears her. Her flirtatious and vapid exterior conceals a superb
command of magic and arcane science. She is second only to the Dowager in necromancy,
and she follows close behind the Walker in Darkness and the First and Forsaken Lion in her
application of magitech and necrotech. Even in those areas, however, the Lover favors
misdirection.
Akin to her, you will be able to obscure your own talents and competence. You could be a
masterful necromancer, a mastermind behind several plots to bring ruin to metropoli, and
have spies in every one of your rivals’ inner circles... yet as you keep your secrets close,
those rivals will never think you more than a dilettante at best if you wish. Let alone your true
enemies, should they even know of your existence. As long as you make a token effort to
mislead your enemies and disguise your plots, they will rarely think to question your seeming
incompetence or harmlessness."
311,400,Scholarly Erudite,Mushoku Tensei,Providence,"Wanting to help advance a primitive society would be great and fancy, but pointless if you don’t have the
necessary knowledge and ability to do it. With this you gain knowledge equivalent to a PhD in Hard Science and
all of its branches and an increase in your ability to absorb knowledge like a sponge, where mere months of
learning any subjects Hard Science would allow you to reach PhD-level. When you're doing research and
development on a subject so long it's halfway related to Hard Science this increases the speed of the advancement
and constantly gives you inspiration to finish it. By default you have the knowledge and blueprints of 21st
Century Earth allowing you to build them should you have the skills and ability needed to build Earth
Technology and even you could still draw inspiration from the knowledge and blueprints to make Magic Tools
in this world."
312,400,Team Dynamics,Mushoku Tensei,Providence,"When a party or team members have no coordination with each other they can be easily defeated by an enemy
who’s weaker but can work together. With this, any party or team that you form,join or lead, so long they stayed
together for sometime or experienced a few battles together would form teamwork and trust with each other. As
the teamwork and coordination forms, each member would instinctively know the strengths and weaknesses of
each other and this allows the entire team to cover each one's weaknesses. This also makes each member know
where to position themselves where there would be no blindspot in the team formation allowing them to
intercept attacks that would kill a teammate or terrain that would break the formation."
313,500,Absurd Survival,Street Fighter,Providence,"I'm sure we've all seen it before, the villain dramatically falls off the bridge
into the mist of a waterfall down below, or dies in the fiery explosion of his base of operations alone,
only to show back up eventually not only alive, but fine and working on another plot. You now have
this power.
 Upon purchase, you gain a mysterious, causality based power. Whenever you would ordinarily be
doomed, if no one else is around to witness it, the chances of you escaping/surviving increase
dramatically.
 Even if you're thrown off a catwalk into a turbine, or the only way you're dying while no one is
around is if it really is impossible, like being in the epicentre of a nuclear explosion, or you actively
want too."
314,500,Eyes of a Bodhisattva,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"All things are transitory. Loving some, and hating others...growing,
aging, learning, and fighting. It will fade in time, but you will still be here, under the peach tree.
Your soul is an enlightened one, having gazed into the truth of the universe you live in. Your
mind knows neither turmoil nor hatred, nor can any psychic attack or forced control influence
your thoughts any more than ant may move the stars at night. You can accurately perceive your
surroundings with your eyes shut, seeing the life force of others and your physical senses
almost vestigial in how accurately you can read your surroundings with vivid detail. Finally, your
enlightenment has enabled you a greater understanding of Cosmo - you are able to use great
techniques and power with minimal exertion on your part, and could perhaps unlock the other
Senses through little more than meditation and contemplation in a few years...perhaps even
quicker, should you actively fight and burn your Cosmo. Pity the fool who believes a Bodhisattva
to be a peaceful, gentle creature...you are still very much a warrior of the Gods."
315,500,Wyvern’s Loyalty,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence,"Loyalty is a life drive not so exclusive to the good guys. In fact, the most exemplary are found on both sides. And true loyalty is always rewarded in the end. All blessing and power given/entrusted/offered from someone you are truly loyal to, whether it is a superior, subordinate or equal, is perfectly absorbed, even normally fatal ones like Hades' Ichor. The time and struggle to assimilate it, if any, is however unchanged, but you are sure to eventually succeed and survive. A partial or half-hearted loyalty removes the death protection or the concerned powers immediately. "
316,500,Saintly Duty,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"A Saint’s duty is to protect all of mankind and they do so even beyond their normal limits. When you find yourself directly protecting another person, your power will begin to increase and increase. The more vulnerable the person or people you are protecting at that moment, the greater the increase in power you’ll receive. A wounded comrade still able to fight would provide a noticeable leap in power whilst a defenseless child being behind your back could let you leave gaping wounds in people you couldn’t even scratch before. Those who have no need of protection will not increase your power and once you have finished directly defending them, this increase will dissipate. Protecting numerous people will give much less of an increase compared to the ‘quality’ of the one in need. An entire orphanage would give only a small increase compared to what you would gain from a single child."
317,500,Curseproof,Generic Exalted,Providence,"You don't suffer from The Great Curse, nor can you ever suffer from The
Great Curse or anything like it, the loophole that allowed it to take place being effectively closed.
This is A Big Deal in setting, though virtually no one knows about The Great Curse in the first
place. This perk also makes you heavily resistant to curses in general. As a final bonus you not
only know how and why you became Curseproof, but you also now understand how to make
others Curseproof as well. It will be a trying and difficult procedure even for Exalts accustomed
to hardship but the sheer importance of what you can do with this is not to be underestimated.
This could, literally, change the dynamic of the entire world. Finally while you can teach others
only Exalts on the level of a Solaroid can actually perform the procedure (with you being the
exception if you aren't a Solaroid yourself), so keep that in mind."
318,600,Hero of Legend,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"So many heroes out there on so many worlds. Maybe you want to imitate them? You naturally seem to attract, or maybe you are attracted to, points where you can go on an adventure. If you force it, maybe you can even end up along with the major players in the world?"
319,600,Armor of Will,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Realistically, most heroes would die early in their adventures. But that would be boring. You aren’t gonna die to something as petty as falling down the stairs, are you? You have plot armor, and this has the effect of being hard to kill, unless said attack was deliberate. You avoid accidents by centimeters, walk out of a building shortly before it explodes, and more. However, as was said earlier, if it's a deliberate attack against you, then this plot armor is less effective against that."
320,600,Wide Reputation,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"You must have done something big, because it seems like everyone knows about you, even if what they heard isn’t 100% true. Your actions tend to cause big ripples, ones that affect everyone around you. On top of that, your actions tend to grow in size and ridiculousness, the more people know about them."
321,600,Thanks for the Noodles,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Most people don’t seem to expect the homeless, frail person to be a badass. Whether that description fits you, people underestimate you all the same. Even when given ample warning, they will expect you to be weaker than you actually are. Even those that fought you before seem to fall into this trap, with them thinking this time will be different.
"
322,600,Claws of the Beast (Requires Rage),Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"To rage is to lose yourself to your inner beast. Well, at least in theory. There are some that managed to keep their skills while berserking, and now you are among their numbers. When you lose all the chains holding you back, you don’t lose any skill in weapons or attack methods or martial arts."
323,600,The Conquering Jumper,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Providence,"Humanity has a potential, one that differs them from the other races. A potential for power. There is a reason 5 out of the 7 Demiurges are human. So long as you seek power, you will find pathways into getting more."
324,600,"Xianxia Protagonist
","A Cultivator's Beginning",Providence,"As a protagonist, just about everything will be easier on you.

You will benefit more from training, becoming much more potent and advanced than other students.

You have a knack for finding long-lost items of great power and mentors of awe-inspiring might that can let you grow more powerful much more quickly. Techniques and training methods that might as well be cheating will practically fall into your lap.

Your enemies will have a hell of a time trying to put you down, any victories they have will be Pyrrhic, and as long as your defeat wasn’t far too crushing, you can bounce back at least somewhat stronger than before.

You will never be permanently killed by anything so mundane and pathetic as a mere fall down the stairs or choking on your food. Your plot armor is ridiculous, letting you get away scot-free with stuff that would maim or ruin others.

You will always find some way to defeat your enemy and will always find a means of gaining more power, skill, and influence so long as there is someone or something out there that can challenge you.

If you are not already, you will even find or get a way to not die of old age, and your life will be easier on you in all ways.

This Perk stacks with similar Perks, enhancing the effects."
325,600,Zongeh Luck,Toriko,Providence,"Best described by Midora near the end: “Despite Zongeh being weak, inept, a coward, and possibly the worst Gourmet Hunter in the Gourmet World, he has, in fact, the greatest Gourmet Luck of any being out there, considering he had experience so many life-threatening events and yet, he escaped each and every single one of them with little to no harm done to himself.”
"
326,600,Progenitor Gourmet Civilization,Toriko,Providence,"This is a big one. You gain knowledge on material durability and how to improve it even more. Buildings and objects made by you will last thousands of years. And even if they age, they will age in such a way that not only will they look great, they will actually be more durable after a few thousands of years. Everything you made or built will affect upcoming generations, inspiring them to better themself."
327,600,Like The Phoenix,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"Though not truly immortal, you are truly akin to
the mighty Phoenix - you simply refuse to accept death, and it rejects you accordingly. When
you suffer from a defeat or setback, you gain both insight into what led to your defeat and ways
you can prevent it (if possible) again, as well as a slight boost to your Cosmo in confronting this
foe or situation again. However, the true power of this is unlocked when you suffer a crushing
defeat - when you are lethally struck down, wiped from existence, cast into an inescapable hell
or any sort of scenario that would result in your death or erasure, you may simply...refuse. Once
per jump, you may cheat this oblivion and emerge from a place of safety, good as new. After
your chain has ended, you may rise again as much as you please - though you may yet
encounter a foe who can end you forever somewhere in the vast multiverse. Should you obtain
the light of the Spark, this affiliation with the Phoenix is now literal - you may never truly die or
disappear unless you so allow it."
328,600,A True Knight,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Providence,"No Knight will ever abandon their Goddess or
someone they value, not even in injury or death. Your ability to guard that which is precious to
you has entered the realm of the supernatural, your devotion strong enough that your comatose
body would spring to life and fight at full power to protect the one you care most about, as well
as completely take any attack that would normally strike them onto yourself and nothing else.
Your durability is likewise stronger for it, your Cosmos flaring greatly to shield both your body
and that of the one under your protection. While this protective instinct will not place you into a
certain-death scenario (unless you wish it, for whatever reason), it will let you guard those you
love even in the worst possible conditions, boosting your willpower and bodily endurance to do
so."
329,600,For my Lord,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence,"You want to do even more for them, and so you will. Dedication and training now work on the power received through this perk and improve them even if they normally don’t, unless they are already absolute in power and control. Moreover, absorbed power becomes your own : even if taken or given back, you always retain at least a spark of it to train from again, though it may take time.
"
330,600,Pandora’s Favors,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence,"There is something about you, something the Divine can’t help but not ignore. When working for or following the code of a God, you will find that they are much more likely to take notice of your dedication and reward it than with others, though you will rarely get more than what you rightly deserve. The reward can come in many forms : role attributed among their organizations, blessing, special permissions, and so on. In future jumps it works on Gods or similarly “higher powers” : they always seem to favor you over others if you follow their doctrine."
331,600,God’s Right Hand,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Providence,"Well, “liking” you may be far stretched as they are Gods, but you surely have their trust. Much like Pandora for Hades, if you earn and work for it, you can become akin to a god’s right hand, embodying their full authority and role in their absence among any religious or politically affiliated organization. Any follower or warrior will take your order as if it came from their gods, because as far as they are concerned, it is the case. Be careful of your conduct or policy however : what has been given can be taken back, and Gods are not as patient and forgiving as humans… 
"
332,600,The Will Of Pegasus,Saint Seiya Omega,Providence,"Indeed, loyalty to Athena courses through your very soul, a bond that has
endured since the age of myth and transcended the boundaries of time and
space. As a reward for your unwavering devotion, you have been bestowed with
two remarkable abilities. Firstly, at the onset of each jump, you select a person
whom you vow to protect with your entire being. While safeguarding this
individual, your skills and combat abilities are heightened beyond their limits, and
your resilience reaches absurd levels, ensuring your survival until your charge is
safe from harm.
Secondly, deep within your soul lies the ability to defy even the gods themselves.
Through constant reincarnation, you have awakened the innate properties of an
anti-divine creature, becoming a terror to any deity who seeks to bring harm to
humanity. With this formidable power, you stand as a bastion of protection
against the machinations of the divine, unwavering in your commitment to
safeguarding humanity and upholding the ideals of justice and compassion"
333,600,The Miracles of Humanity,Saint Seiya Omega,Providence,"As a Saint, you stand as one of the pinnacle embodiments of humanity's
potential, endowed with the extraordinary ability to create miracles. This power,
feared by the gods themselves, stems from your innate connection to the
essence of humanity. When you harness your human nature to achieve feats that
defy the laws of reality, you find that even the most impossible tasks become
attainable, far easier for you to accomplish than for anyone else, regardless of
their own extraordinary abilities. While these feats may still present significant
challenges, your inherent affinity for transcending the bounds of possibility sets
you apart as a beacon of hope and inspiration, capable of achieving the
impossible and shaping the course of destiny itself."
334,600,Protection of the Gods,Saint Seiya Episode G,Providence,"Even as a God, you have your own superiors. The primordial gods that lead you and created you. Unlike the traitorous Gods that rule the world of today, you still have the favor of your divine creators, manifesting in a shield against any harm. Any foe you have that does not greatly surpass your own power will be unable to harm you, so long as they do not receive the support of any divine being or are not themselves a divine being of some kind. Even if they equal you or slightly surpass your power, their blows will be like the stinging of a mosquito against your divinely armored flesh. Useless and at worst a mere annoyance."
335,600,Destiny? Fate? How Cute,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Providence,"Some universes have their
own fate, some universes have their fate woven by a greater
being. In TDG, this is up to interpretation, be it a natural
occurrence, the universe giving plot armor to Nie Li or the Time
and Space Spiritual God pulling the strings from the backstage.
Now, all of this is meaningless to you. You may choose to follow
Canon, but you can decide to just disregard all that bullshit and
take your destiny into your own hands. Once you choose to do so,
it is impossible to go back, as the future will have diverged from
its predicted outcome. As a bonus, no type of fate manipulation
and prophecies can affect you."
336,600,Kang-tae Luck,Reincarnator,Providence,"This guy is the stuff of legends, seriously, and now you
have the same luck as him, he was once called “Fate Creator”, because of his
endless amount of luck, he always managed to pick useful skills and artifacts that
allowed him to become mankind strongest, a warning that this luck is meaningless if
you don’t work to obtain rewards, as he could only get such things because he
always stood at the front lines of the battlefield and reaped the greatest rewards,"
337,600,Star of Transcendence,Reincarnator,Providence,"Like
Kang Hansoo, Tiamet and Noah, you were born with something very special within
yourself, different from others beings who were created from others materials by
God, someone who possess it contain his personal divine heritage, the benefits for
possessing it are, a natural resistance against superiors beings presence and
domains, you also don’t possess any limits in your growth, any type of growth you
pursue is unlimited and greatly accelerated, anything that tries to contain your
development will miserably fail, the only limiting factor for you is yourself as you are
now capable of attaining the same level of power as God with enough effort given
enough time.
You may alternatively pick the <Seven stars> trait as it one of many manifestations
of a <Star> or create something similar to it.
Outside this jump you will obtain an Angelical form that reflects your true heritage
should you achieve transcendence.
Note: A star of transcendence is a shard of God that allows endless growth for its
holder, more info in the notes."
338,600,<Growth>,Reincarnator,Providence,"Usually for normal adventurers, their growth would be limited in
certain ways, not simply because they need to obtain combat experience, but
because the stronger the skill the more time it takes for it to be trained and raised to
a decent level of mastery, but you have something akin to a <Trait> a very powerful
innate ability, that allows you to raise the mastery of your skills much faster than
others, while a common adventurer would take 10 years to push a <Single
Numbering> to complete mastery you can do it in a single one, this doesn’t give
them any sort of special ability,"
339,600,Eres Charisma,Reincarnator,Providence,"She’s the same as Kang-tae, someone out of legends,
someone who stood until the very end of mankind, and now you posses the same
powerful ability that she posses, that of overwhelming charisma and leadership,
allowing you attract likely minded people to follow you and literally talk everyone of
the tutorial area to set aside their difference so that they can work together for
greater odds of survival, this also makes you good at keeping those that followed
you in line as well as leading them in battle."
340,600,Solo Numbering Skill 2 : <Transcendent Brilliance>,Reincarnator,Providence,"Not much is known about
Transcendent Brilliance abilities besides the fact that it is the most powerful crowd
buffing skill that exists. It is stronger than the Solo Numbering skill Rank 4, Steel
Lord."
341,600,An Oath Taken,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Providence,"The Will of the Heavens is such that any
who dare enter the stairway into Immortality will forever be bound by their word (unless they're a
Daofather) - when an oath to the heavens is uttered, there is no way for most to escape it without
facing annihilation. A similar, and much more powerful oath, called the Lifeblood oath, holds even
more grip over the person, in a way that no matter one’s level of power, it will devour them if

broken. Not for you, however, because you’re a cultivator! The whole point of your journey and
understanding of yourself is to be unbound by any laws and free as the sky. If you allowed oaths
such as this to hold you back, wouldn’t that be the same as admitting defeat? Thus, any oaths that
aim to bind you in any fashion simply fail to enact their consequences when broken. After all, it
wouldn’t do to suddenly have to make trips halfway across the endless Primordial Chaos because
of some silly oath, would it?. Post-Jump this would also apply to any forms of magical contracts
that would have negative effects on you especially if it would lead to your death."
342,600,One Against Many,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Providence,"When the wider Realmverse hears of a grand treasure, it is not uncommon to see alliances
between some of the strongest World Gods, or Daolords in existence. So of course when
someone decides to go off on their own, they’ll usually find that attempting to fight a group of
those on the same level is near impossible. But that’s not true is it? You know for a fact that any

group, no matter how big will have its weaknesses, weaknesses that you are so adept at taking
advantage of, that you might as well have a supernatural power for it. Even if a hundred
Daolords came together, as long as individually none of them were capable of besting you, their

defeat would be as guaranteed as if you were fighting one of them alone."
343,600,Thirty Thousand Seeds,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Providence,"It’s tedious to continually check in on all of your projects, especially when they’re on the other
side of the known Chaosverse. Scientific endeavors need maintenance and tweaking, raising a
student might not lead to them being useful in any way. Thus it’s probably a good thing that side
projects like that always advance as if you put 100% of all your effort into them, and always
come back to benefit you in some way, no matter how miniscule. Leaving a kid you found with
some techniques might let him skyrocket in strength to one day come help you in a war. Creating
a race of ultimate warriors might see them naturally evolve to fulfill that directive, maybe even
evolving traits that make them stand above the rest. Casting aside a single Godgem to create a
Chaosworld may lead to the creation of the greatest genius in the history of the Chaosverse.
Though that one’s still pretty unlikely. Even if these side projects don’t help you much, they’ll
never be a detriment. Go ahead and seed the entire Chaosverse with your power."
344,600,I Am Here.... Now,Jujutsu Kaisen,Providence,"There’s a lot of factors that contribute to a sorcerer’s success: their cursed technique, the finesse with which they manipulate cursed energy, their skill in hand-to-hand combat, their tactical acumen, and so on. Yet, there is one trait that stands apart from the others: luck. A sorcerer can lack other traits and still get by, but one cursed with misfortune won’t last too long, after all. It just so happens that it is this trait you possess in abundance, though in an oddly specific way.

From now on, whenever you’re in a pinch or a situation where the momentum of battle is against you, events seem to occur out of the blue with surprising frequency to turn things back in your favour. If you’re having a hard time, a building nearby might randomly explode, giving you a chance to get a sneak attack in while your opponent’s distracted. Perhaps an ally might stumble upon your plight and decide to join you, or another, entirely separate group of people fighting might interrupt things, wrapping your enemies up in their battle and giving you a chance to escape. Or maybe some random people you’ve never seen before will charge in out of the blue, teach you exactly what you need to know to defeat an otherwise insurmountable foe, then die or run off, likely never to be seen again. It won’t happen every time, so this alone can’t be relied on, but when it does happen it’ll be sure to give you just the chance you need to claim the advantage, and give you something valuable, be it knowledge or an item, in the process."
345,600,Counter Cover ,Kara no Kyokai,Providence,"Humanity has a careful guardian, watching every move, to protect it from threats without and within. This guardian can be quite over-zealous at times, acting to counter even unlikely threats with great force when it believes the need exists. But there are apparently ways to escape it’s sight, and that of similar beings, even when what you’re trying to hide genuinely is a threat. Similar to how the Ryougi managed to hide their efforts to create Shiki’s third personality and connection to the Root, you are able to hide yourself and your actions from higher beings. Metaphysical forces like the Counter Force, gods of older times, cosmic beings like Arayashiki or Gaia itself, even the sorts of greater beings that expand well beyond a single world. The methods involved vary depending on the scale. Just hiding yourself from the Collective Will of Humanity may manifest as a special form of self- hypnosis that is easy to maintain, whereas preventing higher cosmic creatures from noticing large magical rituals involving dozens of participants may require an expensive and time consuming spell of its own. In future worlds, you’ll find it always possible to quickly discover various ways to hide from various such beings. This protection can potentially be bypassed should you in some way draw their direct attention or be found by agents they have of a lesser nature, so overt action should still be taken with care. 
"
346,600,Scarred Path ,Kara no Kyokai,Providence,"Limitations are just barriers to be conquered. Every misery that is thrown down in your path is a step to rise even higher, to use the flaws that cripple your body to enhance your magic ever further. You find that when your body suffers and parts are lost to you, your magic will soon compensate, providing not only additional talent in a related field of magecraft to whatever part of you has been crippled but a sudden breakthrough to effectively replace it. The loss of your sight may result in developing a sudden breakthrough in clairvoyant spells or magecraft that allows for ESP that not only replaces your lost sight but may outright surpass it. A mangled arm may provide the inspiration to greatly increase your level of skill with telekinetic magecraft or some other kinetic field, allowing you to manipulate things from afar with natural ease and immense force, seemingly costing little energy to do so. It takes time, weeks or even months, for these talents to bloom but once they do, they will remain even if you regain what you originally lost. "
347,600,Spare Lives,The God of High School Jump,Providence,"You grow two new horns on your head, in whatever style you choose. Each of these horns represents an ‘extra life’ that has been imbued into your body. When an attack would normally kill you, one of these horns will break and instead the attack will not affect you. Truly powerful attacks may even take both horns breaking to negate but you can at least be assured that nothing will require more than both horns breaking to survive. These horns will only replenish themselves once every ten years and this regenerative process cannot be sped up."
348,600,To Hell with You and Your Gods,The God of High School Jump,Providence,"When you’re up against all of Heaven, victory is most definitely not assured. You’re likely to face more than one big defeat on the path to liberation and it’s all too easy to lose hope. But when you’ve got a job to do like this one, you can’t let one or two losses drag you down. When you lose but manage to survive, you’ll be able to come back almost straight away to what you lost against with even greater power. Maybe you came face to face with a God and they crushed your squad but somehow managed a second wind, filling you with determination that boosts your strength higher then you thought you were capable of. Or another organisation bought you out, leaving you devoid of financial or political strength, yet you manage to find a few backers in just a couple days that let you strike right back at your foes with more money and favours then you’d ever manage to gather before you lost. This by no means makes victory a certain prospect but this second try will always have better chances then your first, even if that better chance is only a sliver above the first one. If you lose a second time, surviving will be wholly up to you.

Boosted: The second try succeeded and you won against your former rivals. But what if they rise back up against you? You'll have the reverse of your original ability too now. Not only do you find it easier to beat enemies on the second try, you'll find it much easier to defeat anyone you've already beaten if they try and fight you again. If you threw down the old regime, they'd find it almost impossible to claw their way back up, even if they'd normally have a fair chance at the act.

349,600,When the Chips Are Down,The God of High School Jump,Providence,"Things have come down to the razor wire. The doomsday clock has hit 11:59. The world is about to explode. You’ve never felt better. The bigger those odds, the more confident in yourself you get. This isn’t arrogance or overconfidence. This is an absolute, ever growing self-surety of what you can do and what your friends can do. More than that though, when those odds really start climbing, you find that your strength starts climbing too. It’s never going to scale to match, it’s not a heroic tale if you beat these odds with ease, but the greater the opponent and the disaster you face, in comparison to you, the stronger you’ll become. Find yourself facing a few dozen priests at once? Your body seems to miraculously restore its stamina at the start of the fight and you can push yourself just a little harder. A Bishop standing in your way? Your body will feel stronger than it should possibly be and you’ll find wells of energy you didn’t think you had. And if Zeus himself, or another High God, descended to stomp you into the ground? You’d be able to pull out every single bit of power and effort you had at least twice over to try and give yourself a chance. There is a limit to this however. You can only withstand so much of this boost, even against the great odds you might face, and if you try to draw too much power from you, you might irrevocably damage your body or spirit. What’s the point of beating the bad guy if you die in the process and never get to see your happy end?

Boosted: So you beat the bad guy. Triumphed against all odds. But what was the point if that desperate battle if what you were fighting for was lost? You'll find that now, things have an odd way of working out if you won the climactic fight. Collateral damage was not nearly as bad as it may have appeared, reconstruction efforts go ahead smoothly and easily. Unless they were directly killed in the fight, your loved ones would never be hurt. Even when it really should not be possible, it seems like things lead strongly towards a happy end for you with even the slightest chance of happening, so long as you managed to actually win.

350,600,Hanyou,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Providence,"Okay, you’re special, Jumper. And everyone realises this! You find that people around you tend
to practically fall over themselves to grant you artefacts, powers and abilities, be they
superpowers or letting you summon their servants as your servants, or something in between.
This happens most often with beings of great power and age, demons and demon gods, spirits
and plain gods, but affects just about everyone. They never seem to care what other powers you
have, even if they come from their enemies. Nor do they have much restraint in handing out the
good stuff, making you among the most powerful ever empowered by them at a minimum.
They do this most often through letting you share their bloodlines, or souls, or something in
that vein, granting you power that won’t fade with time but instead only likely improves, though
the latter is far from automatically assured.
The bloodlines and powers you recieve in this way never harm you in any way, shape or form,
and they always play well with each other, even if it makes no sense."
351,600,Magnetic,Generic Naruto Fanfiction,Providence,"You have something about you, a way, a certain je ne sais quoi that gets people to follow you.
Maybe it’s your charm, your goodness or purity, maybe it’s destiny nudging things along, but
wherever you go you tend to find people of great power or ability who are all too willing to assist
you. Experienced generals, old shinobi who could kill whole armies by themselves, princesses
who are just perfect to sort out any political troubles you might have... all are drawn to you like
moths to a flame, only with a better outcome, hopefully, for the moths.
Not only do they follow you, but all of you bond to each other to ridiculous degrees, letting you
work together with legendary synergy, almost reading each other’s thoughts, moving as one on
the field of battle. This also lets you work together when it comes to training, letting each of you
advance almost an order of magnitude faster in any field when teaching each other, and in
general letting you improve ridiculously quickly via spars or joint training.
You automatically encounter many people who this works on, but any companions or followers
are included in all of this by default."
352,600,Its Own Equilibrium,RWBY: Ever After Gauntlet,Providence,"Balance is not two forces locked in an neverending batle. Balance is an ecosystem, an organism, a living breathing thing. Thus balance can not be restored by force or calculation, true balance finds its own equilibrium. And you are a walking proof of it. You are in Harmony with the World around you. Corrupting forces or powers that would clash together no longer do so when you are wielding them, allowing you to use contradicting powers or antithetical abilities without being affected yourself or one weakening the other."
353,600,Destiny,RWBY,Providence,"Do You Believe in Destiny? Well it seems to believe in you Jumper. Your plots and schemes seem to be protected, improved in such a way that makes it much more harder to prevent them, and even in the face of opposition, a minor win might still remain. It is a bit more difficult to take you down than it should be. Somehow you keep living and being a pain to your opponents. Frozen and dumped into a lake inside a cave? You thaw and can punch your way out. Taking you down for good will take a good amount of effort, more than most will be capable of bringing up. Keep in mind though, this does not by any means make you invincible. You can still fail and suffer. Its only gotten more difficult to kill you for good and your enemies will have to make sure you actually bit the Dust."
354,600,Last One Standing,RWBY,Providence,"To be a Huntsman or a Huntress is to fight in an endless war. It is to face death and threats no normal man could hope to survive. In such an arduous proficiency you will be faced with severe struggles. Its good than that that is where you excel. The more dire a situation, the better you become. This Perk won’t give you inhuman power but the Power that IS there? Your Aura reserves just hold barely well enough to endure a fatal blow. Your Punches will be knockout blows even as your fists are broken and bruised. For this Perk to truly shine you must be in a dire Situation however. Faced with a powerful Grimm while your allies are all out cold? You might just claw yourself a victory from the jaws of defeat."
355,600,Thrice Setting Sun,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Providence,"True majesty never really passes. Not while their loyal citizens still call out for help. Even should you
be killed, it’s very hard to make you actually die. You’re able to revive yourself from death, up to
three times per week before your ability runs dry, and find yourself quickly healing and restoring
your energy back to full health once you do, though it takes you a few minutes to get back on your
feet. These extra lives do recharge each week but sufficiently powerful attacks, ones more powerful
than your own usual level of power, can take more than a single life from you through this and
potentially knock out all three, though you can at least be sure it won’t take that final one unless
they wait around and hurt you again. Should you ever truly reach your final death that ends your
chain or your journey after that, from which you can’t return, you’ll be given one last reward as part
of your Roman heritage. It’ll allow you to ascend as a special Divine Spirit capable of watching over
and guiding any empire that you have built across all of your time, eternally acting as a honored
ancestor to your people in their times of need."
356,600,The Hero of Charity,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Providence,"In a time when feuds have lasted generations and terrible wars raged for years over the problems of
a meagre few, it must be something special to be someone that the enemy cannot deny. Yours is the
soul of a gallant hero, a mien of such intensity that all who see you are forced to acknowledge that
you are someone important in this world. Whatever impression you leave on people, whatever
effects you have, they are magnified enormously. What might be a normal rivalry between young
men could develop into a tale remembered in legends for millennia to come, a god who might feel
respect for your humility in obeying his wishes normally would feel himself so filled with shame for
taking advantage of you that he would force himself to grant his finest weapon in recompense. 

A stature as what you have, as a hero or an antagonist, is certain to gather many allies around you. When a few words of friendship and a battle at each others side is enough to become life long
friends, you are sure to become an icon to those around you. Indeed, your very nature is that of one
to whom friendship results in far greater results than normal. That which you receive from your dear
friends willingly becomes vastly greater in scope. Fighting alongside your brothers in arms would see
you defeat foes thrice your might in normally impossible battles. A weapon received from a dying
friend would ignite with a hundred times it’s normal shine, bolstered to incredible levels by the
bonds you share. If you found yourself fighting the heavens themselves, with only the gifted power
of two gods that have declared themselves your friends, you might yet succeed. For what could even
an entire pantheon hope to achieve against the power of friendship?
"
357,600,The Awarded Hero,Fate/Legends - Nirvana Yuga,Providence,"When your first cries were heard as a child, the stars shone in anticipation. Your life from the very
first breath was blessed beyond measure. It would not be wrong to say that you were born to be
loved by everyone. As you grew up, you found that life naturally guided you to success. You were
born with the quality of being the protagonist of the story, not just your own tale but the story of
the world around you. Your incredible fortune heaps blessings on you at every opportunity, ensuring
that you are never lacking except in the most extreme of cases. One born a pauper would find
himself part of the richest, noblest and most mighty family in the kingdom before he reached
maturity. At times, you will find things gifted to you as soon as the thought crosses your mind that
you have need or desire of them. Perhaps the gods themselves watch over you, eager to shower you
in gifts, manifesting food before you when you feel hunger or magical tools in your hands when you
seek to engage in a task. Your luck might not accomplish everything on it’s own but just that fortune would render you enormously gifted and capable, something only further added to if you have other
gifts already.

But in some ways, your fortune is also cruel. There can only be one hero, one to whom all the
fortune is awarded, and he must have his villains to conquer. The antagonists of your destined story
are heaped with as many misfortunes as you are blessings. Curses and poor luck rain on your
enemies heads, even those who would only be minor obstacles to you find themselves blocked at
every path. The famous story of Karna’s efforts against the perfect Arjuna are an ideal example, the
charitable Karna cursed and sapped of strength and stripped of his finest tools and betrayed by his
most loyal aides. Those who are truly great can ascend beyond this bad luck and challenge or even
defeat you in spite of it all, despite the wailing of the heavens above at them daring to stand in the
way of the chosen hero. But all too often, you’ll do as everyone expects. Prove victorious as the hero
of the story must, even if that hero might sometimes feel doubts about how much his own efforts
matter when fate favours him so much."
358,600,Goddess of War,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Providence,"Divine is your presence when you ride out onto the battlefield, in how your soldiers see your shining
aura and how your foes crumble before your wrath. With sword and spear few but the gods
themselves can match your skill, even wielding eight of your favoured weapons at once becomes
somehow a deadly style. Even more such when you split your being into eight clones, each as
capable as the original and sharing your mind and presence between them. Fight and command in
eight places at once or force your hated enemies to duel one on eight. 

Your skill and numerous bodies are backed by enough raw power to contend with most of the
heroes and monsters that walk these lands. Most men believe that your powers are granted by the
gods of war, some that you are yourself such a being, and they’re not far from the truth. You have a
measure of divinity already, which grows as your feats in battle and war do. Winning impossible
sieges, conquering great empires and slaying famous swordsmen in duels will all improve your divine
power. Your physical strength mainly at first but should it grow great enough, you may find yourself
turning into a true divine spirit of war as a result, with all the abilities natural to such things. 

The advancement of the modern age won’t prove a threat either, as firearms find reality itself
warping their arcs away from you. Even a bullet guided by magic would curve it’s trajectory away
from your body, so long as you can keep clear in your mind the idea that mere bullets could never
hit or stop you. Slipping in this surety can reduce the protection, making it possible for enough
massed fire to still hit you. 

Finally, that divine nature has a intense effect on those that fight with you. When you personally
fight alongside allies or loyal servants, you’ll inspire an intense, eventually fanatical, devotion to your
ideals. A few battles side by side and most men would die to protect your honour. Something of the
opposite applies to your enemies, awakening intense terror in those that defy you, growing the
longer they directly challenge you while in your presence. It would be difficult to not end a campaign
with an army of men who truly believe that you are their Goddess of War."
359,600,Worthy Luck,Fate/Legends - Vive la France,Providence,"Charlemagne’s paladins would not have survived even a half of their adventures without the luck of
heroes, particularly that seemingly inept young man called Astolfo. Luck takes a special form for the
heroes like these, not solving issues for you but providing to you the tools that let you solve things
yourself. At least, most of the time. Your great amount of fortune focuses on this, ensuring that
enemies accidentally leave behind their magical blades for you to use, friends loan you just the
obscure trinket you need before you go on an adventure that reveals a desperate need for it or you
‘accidentally’ seduce a village girl who turns out to be a noblewoman that can get you out of trouble
later, should you prove your affections again in the jail cell you’ve been held in. The greater the danger, the greater the benefit your luck will bring to you, though these uses must
remain in the realm of what could be possible, and even in truly dire situations, where just an added
tool or ally might not help, your luck can even temporarily bend what is possible. A sword strike
might suddenly skip your neck instead of cutting it off, an ally moves faster than should be possible
or you seem to have just enough energy for one last attack even after you already did your one last
attack. These sudden surges of fortune are a staple of heroes when pushed to the edge but appear infrequently, no more than a handful of times each adventure. A hero relies on themselves after all, the luck is just an added bonus to smooth the edges over."
360,600,I Will Have My Revenge,Gourmet Of Another World,Providence,"There will more than likely be some points where you are defeated or even brought to the brink of death. This doesn’t mean that it's the end however. Whenever you are on the verge of dying or in a critical situation you will receive an opportunity. This moment could allow you to either flee or to reverse the situation depending on how bad things are. Second, whenever you are forced to flee you will receive new opportunities to level up. For example after Duan Ling fled after losing to Blacky he somehow ended up in a secret realm and leveled up five grades while he was here. You will end up in similar situations hopefully without a plot armored protected protagonist hunting you."
361,600,Xianxia Protag,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"Well since one guy refused the call, it seems it falls to you. You know what
this does, talent, luck, harem bait, etc. All the boons of a Xianxia
Protagonist. Weirdly enough those types are fairly common even in the
Azure Hills, maybe it's something in the water."
362,600,Give to the Earth and the Earth Gives Back,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"Achieving Symbiosis, the act of forming mutually beneficial relationships
between two or more parties. And you just happen to be great at forming
symbiotic relationships with just about anything.

Whenever you give anything to or do anything for anyone else they tend to
reciprocate in kind and do so willingly. What they give/do back depends on
how they value what you did for them and what they value what they are
doing/giving back in turn. So something insignificant to you but massively
significant to them could still get them to give what they consider significant
back. The opposite holds true as well, if they consider it insignificant, it
doesn't matter how important it was to you. You cannot use this to demand
anything specific in return, it only works by giving freely. The recipient also
has no specific time table to repay you, they will do so as is appropriate to
their situation. And by giving without concern for whatever they will give
back you will find yourself quickly endeared to whoever you give to,
especially if they consider whatever you gave them significant.
This also guarantees that where you go, there will be an Earth Spirit to give
tribute to, the strength of the Spirit will depend on the place you go to, so
no guarantees that it will have the potential of a Spirit like Tianlan, but you
will always be able to improve an area by working with it. You may
optionally be completely unaware that you even have this Perk."
363,600,Wild Upset,Beware Of Chicken,Providence,"Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is enemy action.
So who the hell did all of your enemies piss off? Whenever you fight
someone stronger than you, you’ll find you get an opportunity to either turn
the tables or achieve some form of victory if the gulf is too vast to win
outright. You could pull off multiple back to back upset victories though
don’t expect that you can pull this off forever. It is only an opportunity after
all, you have to see it through and nothing says your enemy can’t manage
to overcome it. And should this not be enough and you lose anyway? You’ll
find you are quite good at bouncing back after a loss. Even something as

devastating as having your Cultivation crippled may not be the end of your
path so long as you play your cards right."
364,600,Beloved of the Infinite Mysterious Samsara,Against The Gods,Providence,"You have a way with beings that are beyond
mortality. Be it gods, spirits of nature, even devils or other similar beings, you find they all tend to
have an inexplicable fondness for you.
Firstly, they always start with a good opinion of you. Unless you knowingly do something to offend
them, even the most unreasonable beings tend to be understanding and friendly.
But a more relevant part of this is that such beings are excessively likely to grant you powerful
blessings and treasures, even forgiving any transgressions or irregularities. Simply put, if there
exists a possibility of something being granted to a mortal by a divine spirit, not only do you find
yourself propelled to the absolute front of the waiting list, you also find that such beings go far
above and beyond in rewarding you, granting you favors and powers far beyond those they would
otherwise bestow, all other things being equal.
This can even, time to time, go to ridiculous extents, like a spirit granting you something it really
shouldn’t, even things it might need to survive in the future."
365,600,Everyone loves an Underdog,Cradle,Providence,"The odds might be so slim they're measured with
seven zeros behind the decimal. That doesn't matter so much anymore. If you really, truly try
your best, even if you stumble, you've got a damn good shot of beating those odds and coming
out on top. You might not win every single fight you're involved in, or get what you
wanted/needed out of a deal, but you're lucky enough to avoid outright dying most of the time, at
worst you lose an arm and get a replacement that turns you even stronger. This isn't foolproof,
however, if you charge recklessly into everything, you get what you deserve."
366,600,Disciple Greets her Master,Cradle,Providence,"Eventually, the old generation of warriors has to pass on,
and when they do, you are there to pick up the slack. Should a mentor figure of yours ever be
forced to retire or die or otherwise be unable to continue directly teaching you, you will find that
their wisdom and skill will slowly absorb into your soul and mind for up to a year afterwards, and
you will have an easier time finding new teachers to help push you along further."
367,600,Blessing of the Dragon God,Dragon Ball,Providence,"The Dragon’s God power also known as Miracle power can manipulate fate. Individuals
who have been bestowed with this power become favored by fate itself. By taking this
perk you can acquire the Miracle power of Zalama. This will grant you the so-called halo
of a main character giving you countless beneficial opportunities. For example, you will be 
able to frequently break through bottlenecks on the brink of death, receive
guidance from experts, and otherwise trigger miracles. This power cannot be actively
channeled, but its effects are extremely profound. Lastly, given that this power
originates from Zalama you will gain a high affinity with dragons and dragon-related
abilities."
368,600,Have Faith In Lord Jumper,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"You are a vulgar, immoral creature, the kind of disgusting fiend that anyone would look down
upon. So how do you keep getting people to do what you say? How do you get them to
worship you and debase themselves with stupid chants and dances?
It’s because you possess a wild, terrifying kind of charisma that can bend the will of even the
most powerful and prestigious figures, so long as you have the time to talk them around.
Hordes and hordes of weaker cultivators can be won over easily, converted into fanatically
loyal followers that will obey you to the death while cooperating with each other perfectly. Even
convincing sea demons to sing a song proclaiming themselves to be “seafood dishes” wouldn’t
take very long."
369,600,I Shall Steal The Heavens,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Providence,"At least, that is what seems to be your motto. You have an eye for opportunity and profit that
would do the greatest of businessmen and thieves of any universe proud. No matter where you
are, what you’re doing and how one might ordinarily react, if there exists any possibility of
getting some item, money, favors, or anything at all in any situation around you, you always
just happen to have a plan ready to go; as easily and autonomously as breathing.
When it comes to people, you have the devil’s own cleverness, with a talent for fooling them,
exploiting their good or bad intentions for profit, and all around making them grit their teeth
while forking over fortunes to you.
And it’s no less effective on inanimate things. The insides of a house are cursed? Peel off the
roofing tiles. Karma is required to take things out of a treasury? Create fake Karma threads.
Simply put, if it’s at all possible for a material advantage to be extracted out of a situation you’ll
know just how to do it in the best, safest and most profitable way.
And better still, you have the sheer, barefaced audacity to pull it off. No matter where you are,
who you’re talking to or what you’re saying, you can do it boldly and convincingly enough to
convince anyone watching that doing what you’re saying is probably the best thing to do, even
if moments later (or even at that exact moment) they end up cursing your name for it.
This natural tendency also gives you great insight into danger and how to avoid it. You have an
inborn instinct that warns you of danger and allows you to navigate even the most perilous
situations and environments like a fish swimming through water when most others would be
destroyed without even knowing how they died."
370,600,Fateless Circle,Generic Exalted,Providence,"You are the master of your Fate and no other. Attempts to hinder you
through prophecy or the manipulation of Destiny fail outright, attempts to divine your location,
your actions, your intentions, or indeed anything at all about you using supernatural methods
simply do not work upon you. This protection can be shared with those close to you, no more
than eight at a time, and this protection never interferes with your own abilities or methods. You
may grant this protection with a touch and at no cost, and it lasts until you revoke it which may
be done at will regardless of where they are in relation to you.
 In Creation Fate is a powerful thing and you are perhaps the only being that is not subject to it,
and can not be made subject to it, in any shape or form. In future jumps this works on similar
abilities. As a side benefit individuals that use such abilities will not realize you possess this
protection, their predictions and visions seeming to be accurate but, in truth, failing to account
for you. Additionally so long as you're striving towards greatness you will find that matters
smooth themselves out for you. You will not be hindered by petty regulations and bureaucrats,
search teams and hunters will miraculously skip past you or arrive just after you have left, and
events will occur in such a fashion that you rarely if ever suffer from major setbacks.
Be warned however, while your Fate is in your hands you must truly strive for greatness if you
wish to really benefit from this. Living a life of mundanity will not accord you any benefits at all
beyond protection from the manipulations of destiny that your enemies might use to find you.
Finally you may use this ability to, once per jump, avoid death. Any time you would otherwise be
killed this ability will activate and prevent you from dying. Your various pools of energy will be
refilled, you'll be restored to full health, and any mind altering or compulsion effects you labored
under will be broken. This is a perfect conceptual effect. Post-Chain this is once every ten
years"
371,600,Heart of the Sun,Solars Exalted,Providence,"Though your Exaltation is mighty indeed, there is a part of it that sorely
lacks in comparison to its progenitor. The Unconquered Sun was created to represent perfection
in all its forms, including the four virtues of Valor, Temperance, Compassion, and Conviction. As
the First Age all too handily demonstrated, these virtues were either in great excess without
their original meanings, or simply lacking in them where it counted most. But your Exaltation is
very close to its origin, and it breathes new life into both your body and your heart. Your
emotions and the virtues you hold dearest to your heart will burn with bright intensity, never
losing their vibrancy to the woes of time or the stresses of adventure, yet it will also allow you to
exercise wisdom and view the world objectively without being blinded or controlled by your own
passions.
Your Compassion may make you weep for every innocent life lost, but it will not blind or cripple
you with angst or foolishness. Your Valor may bring you stand fearlessly against overwhelming
odds, but you will not need to make a suicidal last stand in an impossible battle. This also
applies to other aspects of life you consider your ‘virtues’, not being limited to the four of this
world. In short, you may invoke or suppress these virtues with no detriment to yourself at will,
from awe-inspiring levels or a simple ‘mortal’ level. Finally, this strength of will is absolute,
allowing you to casually brush away any attempt to manipulate you emotionally or mentally,
whether through mind control or coercion, always able to think clearly and decisively when the
moment calls for it. The only thing that will ever sway you is what you choose to allow. You will,
now and forever, shine as bright as daybreak."
372,600,Sword of the Sun,Solars Exalted,Providence,"To fight against the Primordials in their prime with naught but an army
of mortals...surely, such a feat should have been impossible, no more possible than an ant
slaying a living planet. But it was, and Creation was forever changed by it. Embodying that
power to surpass overwhelming odds, your martial prowess is now defined by overcoming
superior foes. When fighting a foe with a distinct advantage against you - power, size, scale, or
even the amount of soldiers in an army - those advantages become mitigated or even
manageable, letting you fight them on more even ground. An enemy who could slay you with a
wave of their hand will find it difficult to actually focus their will upon you, a giant finds their size
a hindrance instead of a help, while a gigantic army is no more difficult to overcome than a
well-armed squad. Be warned that lacking the means to actually fight such enemies - an army of
your own, Charms, or such - will merely give you the means to survive or stall the bout.
However, should you possess both the means and the will - even the mightiest of legions will

falter against you."
373,600,Peer of Hell,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"As one of the Princes of the Green Sun, you fill an unique position within the hierarchy of
Hell. Like the Strangers that wandered in from elsewhere, you are not beholden to the Laws
of Cecelyne. Unlike them though, you are still protected by these Laws. As such, you
position is above all Serfs of the First Circle and above many of the less potent Citizens of
the Second Circle. Even if you should leave, the lesser demons will still see you as all but
Unquestionable, your demands as much a proclamation as a binding word of Law. While this
is most effective on demons of all kinds, your authority extends even beyond Malfeas, as
your words will command those below you as surely as it does the serfs of demonkind. Most
will simply and unthinkingly obey whatever command you give, convinced on an unknowable
authority you wield over them. Those of exceptional power and will may resist or even
completely ignore you, as long as you are not obviously greater.
Even those mighty beings are somewhat affected though, granting you a measure of
leniency and respect they may never grant to any but their own peers. In doing so, you may
even question their will and ignore the commands of those great demons of the Third Circle,
Unquestionable as they otherwise might be. Most unique of all... you could even approach
the Yozi themselves, when they take humaniform, to engage in courteous conversation with
those the inhabitants consider above all. And while you might not be able command them,
you will find it easy to speak to all those who consider themselves Unquestionable and
above all others. As a true favorite of the Demon Princes, you will find yourself the peer and
perhaps quickly a trusted advisor of the highest ranks of demons and even their progenitors.
Should you play your cards right, you might even be able to take the Shadow’s place as the
mastermind of the Reclamation."
374,600,Hero of Hell,Infernals Exalted,Providence,"In Creation, the Immaculate Faith preaches of the evils of the Anathema, and how they are
drawing the world into despair and ruin. They tell of people who have become conduits for
terrible, dark power with their souls forever tainted by demons. When the monks speak of
these Anathema, they are describing the Solar, Lunar, and recently even the Abyssal
Exalted demonizing them as the enemies of the Immaculate Faith... Yet this description fits
the new Princes of the Green Sun quite aptly, wielding the power of the Yozi and guided by
the demon who has become their Coadjutor. So, why not become the very thing they fear?
You may now be the Anathema amongst the Chosen, embodying the ideal of a horrifying
being of dark power far beyond the Princes of the Earth. Aside from a tremendous increase
in physical attributes beyond that of even other Chosen, this brings some other benefits.
You shall grow in power with every victory, bolstering your strength and skills. So that you
shall soon become an unstoppable engine of destruction when faced with your enemies, a
mastermind without equal, and a socialite beyond compare. Every aspect of your being shall
be enhanced, and word will spread across the lands of your terrible deeds. The mighty of
Creation will hate and fear you, or tremble in fear of this unknown yet atrocious enemy. But
in hell, you shall become the star of the Reclamation, the envy (and sometimes hero) of your
so-called peers, and demonkind shall either worship you or rage at your meteoric rise in
status and power.
Yet, hell is a ruthless place and this greatness has a price... For should the unthinkable
happen and you suffer a defeat, this bolstering effect shall be broken and you will be
reduced to your base ability until once again you may taste victory. If word spreads of such a
thing, it could even damage your reputation as an unstoppable force of ruin and corruption.
Nevertheless, this power will serve you well for as long as you can hold on to your
advantage. With it, you might soon be the one to shatter the gates of hell..."
375,600,Voice of the Void,Abyssals Exalted,Providence,"Every Abyssal bears the stain of the Neverborn upon her soul and Essence. For some, this
connection stays as distant and impersonal as the relationship between the Solar Exalted
and the Unconquered Sun. Others are less fortunate. The Neverborn are not kind gods, but
unknowable horrors who hate their Exalted only marginally less than they hate their
enemies. Abyssals particularly blessed, or cursed, with the direct attention of their chthonic
masters experience an endless torrent of blasphemies that gnaw away their sanity.
You are blessed with a particular connection to the Whispers of Oblivion, allowing you to
consciously tap into this connection without fear for your sanity. And yet, your attunement to
the dreams of the Neverborn is agonizingly clear, each vision revealing subtle contextual
details and tangentially related facts you might never have thought to consider, plus
unambiguous awareness of the Neverborn’s wishes related to the topic. The Whispers can
substitute for skill in any endeavor, allow you to glean a wealth of information from the minds
of the Neverborn, and serve as a guide to where the Neverborn believe your actions could
further their goals.
Moreover, you will find that insane ghosts and spectres will heed your words, your terrible
connection to their ultimate masters evident through their madness, and that maddened
death cults will treat you with equally fervent respect and devotion. Perhaps more usefully,
you may speak in the tongues of the Neverborn themselves, echoing the Whispers of
Oblivion with your own voice to drive both ghosts and mortals to insanity and bless them with
the attention of your chthonic masters. Such newly-deranged spectres and mortals will view
you as the living incarnation and prophet of the will of the Neverborn, serving with eager and
suicidal fanaticism."
376,600,Harem Protagonist,Mushoku Tensei,Providence,"Fate has really strange plans for you and it expects a lot of relationship shenanigans and peculiar happenings, all
of it aimed at making you a Harem Protagonist. You are more likely to find and meet someone who meets your
preferences. Your lovers would become open minded to share you with others as long you give them a heads-up
that you plan on forming a harem or finding a new harem member. You also possess a superhuman talent at
managing your harems to the point that you can always have time with each of them, making them unlikely to
feel neglected. You and your romantic partners will never grow tired of each others’ presence and the love and
passion you feel for each other will only grow with time and never wane. Your love will aid you in overcoming
any trials and even disappearing in a gauntlet for thousands of years will not stop them from loving and
supporting you."
377,600,Destinies Favor,Mushoku Tensei,Providence,"It appears that the universe has great plans for you, by giving you a destiny that will always seek to exalt you
and will present you with constant opportunity for power and fame. Furthermore, you are now but immune to
any deaths that are not glorious, meaning that no assassin will kill you ignominiously with a spiked cup of tea,
and no accident will be the death of you. Those who are close friends and have prolonged contact with you
would gain a fraction of your destiny, while your lovers and descendants would gain a strong destiny equal to
you. This also allows you to defy destined events and predetermined actions, like saving those that are meant to
die an untimely destined death or avoiding an unavoidable attack. While destiny favors you, these are not
absolute as you need to do the legwork and save others yourself. Due to destiny’s favor, you are gifted with
incredible luck, this greatly increases the chance of fortunate events occurring for you. Whether it is a game of
chance or avoiding attacks on you, you are far more likely to succeed than anyone else."
378,800,Everyone’s Hero: The Ultimate Good        ,Avesta of Black and White,Providence,"What a grand figure you have become. Or will become, in due time. You are one gifted the fate of becoming the most brilliant light against the forces of darkness, for you have found yourself in the role of the greatest of the Ashavan as ‘everyone’s hero’. Yours is a destiny of greatness, one that collects all the hopes, dreams and prayers for a brighter future around you, and uses them to shape the path to the most magnificent epilogue. The more heroic acts you perform, the greater feats in battle you partake, the more this image of you as the greatest hero that ever was extends like wildfire, covering nations, even entire planets in mere weeks, growing faster and faster in what seems to be an endless momentum. And the more people join this collective ‘prayer’, the greater your power becomes, making you a living ‘miracle’. The unreachable Arch-Demons become just difficult threats, and even the dream of an ending to the eternal conflict of black and white seems like an actual possibility.

But this is far from your most potent ability. As the hero, it wouldn’t do if your victories were to go unrewarded. And what better place to start amassing your power than from your defeated foes? Each time you claim ‘victory’ over another, you take something special from them, and incorporate it into yourself. Be warned that this ability doesn’t make distinctions between foe and ally, as anyone that is ‘defeated’ by you gets something taken from them. It may be a special item, a power, a commandment or even things such as emotions, loyalties or a cosmic ‘role’.

Furthermore, it doesn’t even require that you defeat someone in a physical confrontation. As long as you prove your irrefutable victory over them, you will still take something from them. The more shaking and absolute your defeat is over your enemy, the more from their own core you can take. With time, even having the thought of admitting defeat before you will be enough for you to strip them of everything that makes them.

Now, once you have claimed your victory, these stolen abilities don’t stay as they were, and instead they are changed to suit your nature. You have little to no control over the result, but you can be sure that whatever you gain won’t be saddled with any weaknesses that it previously had, and at times you may find them even increasing in potency. As it is your right as the victor, you only take the good portions and leave the rest to your defeated foe. Using this privilege, you could take Commandments from others, without needing to abide by their vows, nor suffering any consequences of breaking the original restriction."
379,800,Worthy,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Providence,"Once every few centuries, someone special is born. The sort of person that you just know will be
something great as soon as you see them, even as a child. In these times, that person is Arturia
Pendragon, the future king of Britain. But what if there was another like her? You’ve been found
worthy of the favour of the World now and been blessed for it. Your path is one of great destiny, paved with many gifts and prizes, leading to truly incredible feats. And all it takes from you is to take
the first step to adventure. So long as you pursue great feats and pursuits, you’ll find yourself surrounded by advantages. Mentors and teachers of incredible skill and fame appear to teach you
skills, spells and abilities. You’ll find yourself involved in many stories in favourable ways, gathering
friends, allies and resources without even trying to gain them. As you attempt to improve yourself, so long as it is in the aim of accomplishing great things later on, you’ll find no end to the
breakthroughs and leaps of progress you achieve. While on this golden path, you’ll be protected
from many minor dangers and risks, never needing to fear dying or failing because of accidents or
the threat of unimportant foes in your story. Finally, this blessing of the World has ensured your
natural charisma has skyrocketed to immense heights. Even if you act as an emotionless robot, you
could gather a small army of devoted and powerful retainers over just a few years. It has it’s limits
though, don’t expect people to stick around forever if you never show them a smile. Whatever path
you take, it is one where you are assured to reach the centre stage of the story."
