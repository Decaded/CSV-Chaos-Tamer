and incredible. Maybe there just happens to be a rope to let you swing across the ballroom
dramatically as you make off with the nobles treasure, or maybe there's just the right amount of
handholds and footholds on two opposing walls, at just the right distance from each other, that
would allow you to dramatically wall jump your way up.
So long as you strive to do things in an amazing and/or over the top fashion you will be slightly
rewarded for doing so, Fate conspiring to make you that little bit better at whatever you're doing
because apparently Fate is really fond of over-the-top action sequences. You can still fail when

slight-to-moderate increase when you're purposely trying to be amazing."

You may choose any breathing style you like for any level or you can create your own on the same level as described, they don’t need to be for swords either, and note that all the higher levels can be reached by training.

Tsuguko: Now your proficiency is much higher, not only are you naturally stronger in all respects, but you have mastered Total Concentration: Constant! The difference between using the breathing technique constantly, every second of every day, even when asleep, and not is like night and day.

Hashira: The highest position of a demon slayer, usually gained by killing at least 50 demons or killing one of the 12 moons as a kinoe(the highest normal rank of demon slayers).

Your body is much stronger than the previous option, so much so you could be faster than the eye could see, and you may have even developed techniques of your own that no one else knows, but the most notable change is in your stamina, being able to go through extremely harsh training for weeks or even months straight.

It might be the formal training in a Shinigami academy or the lessons of the wild in Hueco Mundo but you’ve got a good idea of how to tear other people apart. You’re a capable
combatant in a general area, such as Zanjutsu for Shinigami or the natural weapons of a Hollow, and
have enough combat experience to mostly keep your cool in a fight. You actually turned out to be a
decent hand at it all, maybe you’ll be able to learn to fight even faster going forward. "
49,100,Master Swordsman,Ragna Crimson,Martial Art,"What’s power without some skill? Unlike the more brutish dragon hunters, you are actually skilled in the use of a weapon of your choosing, having several years of experience behind you and a particular talent for it. Not that skill alone would let you defeat the powerhouses of this world, but with a strong weapon in your hands and provided they didn’t use any strong magics, you could give a good battle to even the middle dragons and even hold the weakest Seija for a time. You are also able to recognize the talent or experience in others by exchanging just a single blow with them."
50,100,Training,Chrome Shelled Regios,Martial Art,"You have received training in all weapons, martial arts, tracking, acrobatics, parkour, & Kei. This puts you on equal footing with an experienced user in their chosen fields, but you still need more time and experience to become a master."

Profound Art of the highest quality. Profound Arts are typically classified into Movement skills,
Concealment skills and Profound Skills, which are basically attacking techniques. There are also

special cultivation measures, illusion techniques, armed or unarmed techniques... and so many other
options.

design one for yourself, within these constraints.
For 300 CP, the art can be any and all that exist in this setting, from the arts of the highest King
Realms to the Legendary Beast arts like the Word Ode of the Phoenix or the Golden Crow’s Record
of the Burning World. Again, you may design your own if you want, so long as the power levels
correspond.

bloodline receive the related profound art for free."

further training and trials against those who are equal to or stronger than you."
53,100,Wild Life,A Will Eternal,Martial Art,"Living in a cultivation world is extremely dangerous, and that’s before one starts to mess
around with other cultivators and sects. The very world they live in is one filled with an
uncountable number of natural hazards and dangerous beasts. You’re something of a nature
survival expert. You have the know-how and skill to survive out in the wilds of a natural

weapons such as bows, spears and daggers all fall within the purview of your school. Even throwing
bombs around is a martial art. If it works, it works."
56,100,Stuntmaster,Solars Exalted,Martial Art,"The absolute best part of being a skilled warrior as a Solar Exalt? It’s how
your every movement follows with both grace and grandeur, how you become a stuntmaster
that makes combat look almost like dancing. Your attacks become eye-catching and graceful,
and while no more effective, your skills in battle will look visually impressive in addition to your
already-existing effectiveness. This can also be applied to any sort of skill, power or trade you
put effort and enthusiasm into, letting you perform all of your abilities while looking absolutely
fantastic doing so."
57,100,Warrior's Mettle,Infernals Exalted,Martial Art,"A warrior is nothing without his weapons, but a weapon is nothing without a warrior to wield
it. So such you have become skilled in your weaponry and fighting style of choice, which
comes with an understanding of how to best use these skills to your advantage. Perhaps you

were one of many spearmen marching with an army, perhaps you were a trained archer, a
martial artist, a gladiator, or even an assassin. But martial skill alone does not make a
warrior and you have also gained an understanding on how to taunt your enemies, how to
make them hate you, how to draw them out, and how to break them. You will also gain a
grandiose and terrifying villainous laugh, to properly express your satisfaction at your
victories."
58,100,Annihilation of Existence Compleat,Abyssals Exalted,Martial Art,"They Who Dwell Among the Wretched work alone as often as they work with their fellow
deathknights, hunting their mortal prey in Creation at the behest of their Deathlord and
Neverborn masters. Operating alone allows them use their full mobility and stealth without
the chance of clumsier peers blowing their cover. Even when they work with other
deathknights, the Children of Blood sometimes vanish without warning to take care of some
problem, such as assassinating a pursuing monk or eliminating all the sentries in a fortress.
Whether they work as spies, enforcers, saboteurs, or assassins in the Underworld and
abroad in Creation, one thing remains constant. They amongst the deathknights are the
ones who have perfected quick and covert action. And now you too will share in their swift
lethality and cat-like stealth, your passage noiseless and unnoticed."

Six-Faced World such that you could be considered a Saint-Rank in this Three Sword-Styles. While this also

innate talent at learning and mastering any Martial Arts-Styles though this is more prominent in Armed Martial
Arts-Styles which would allow you to reach Saint-Rank starting scratch within a year’s time though it would be

You’re quite the good martial artist but you excel in the use of your inner life energy, enabling you to accomplish a wide variety of feats. Blasts of energy, enhancing your own body, energy projections, self-healing, flight, and more, with some more esoteric things coming in time. You’re good enough to knock down a small apartment building or two and notably skilled overall with Ki, but you have a long way to go yet. The way will be a bit easier for you than most, given your natural talent for Ki training, however."
63,200,Combat Stylist,UQ Holder,Martial Art,"Only when one combines supernatural power with martial techniques can one achieve true martial excellence. You were taught this, and you took it to heart. You’ve been trained in a supernatural fighting style, using either magic or Ki, allowing your combat abilities to surpass a wizard or Ki users when using your style, though you are severely lacking compared to them in using the energies in other senses. What your style is can be chosen fairly freely. Perhaps a style like the Shinmeiryuu, the magical katana-wielding warriors of Japan. Perhaps a style focusing on using magic in concert with personal firearms instead. Your style must be fairly specific, such as with just a single kind of weapon or type of fighting, but you’ll quickly grow better at using it."
64,200,Ninja Training,UQ Holder,Martial Art,"The secretive arts of the shinobi community have been passed down to you, though you are still just a beginner in the use of them. You’re incredibly stealthy and can easily hide your presence until only those far more powerful and skilled than you can hope to detect you when you hide, as well as having training in all manner of ninja tools and basic martial arts experience too. You were taught the basics of Ninja Ki techniques, such as creating illusions to hide behind, short-ranged teleports, or even creating a small number of clones. You’ll be able to progress further as long as you keep putting in the effort, though you’ll do so a fair bit faster than most young ninja due to your natural talent for the shinobi arts."

79,200,Shivering Arrow,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Martial Art,"You may purify some kind of physical ranged projectile, like a bullet or an arrow, and by using it in battle, the projectile never misses its target, even turning 90-degree angles and dodging obstacles to hit their target. Damaging them, however, isn’t a guarantee."
80,200, Pattram Sword Hand,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Martial Art,"Using Atum, you can allow your unarmed attacks to act as if they were bladed, allowing you to cut into people. The sharpness of this blade depends on how strong you are, but even a regular human can treat their unarmed strikes as a steel sword. As a side effect, it is harder for you to break your own limbs in combat when hitting others."
81,200,Whirlwind Iron Cutting Fist,One Punch Man,Martial Art,"This martial art is as swift and destructive as a storm, combining raw speed with precision strikes. Your fists move like a whirlwind, cutting through the air with such force that they create shockwaves.

You focus your entire energy into a single strike aimed at your opponent’s vital points, delivering enough force to incapacitate or even kill in an instant.

Having this ability means that you are capable of manipulating your life energy within your
body. You are more in control of all the muscles in your body, even the involuntary ones, able to
slow down or stop your heart by force of will alone. Alternatively you could shift your internal
organs out of the way of lethal strikes. The magician Harry Houdini was notable in using this
technique to prevent internal bleeding. Furthermore, the effects of your particular brand of ki
may be greatly enhanced, increasing the benefits of Sei or Dou Ki as needed."

88,200,"Sword God Style

",Mushoku Tensei,Martial Art,"The first of the three major sword styles and the one considered to be the strongest. Sword God Style focuses heavily on offensive techniques and making the first strike and will usually try to overwhelm enemies with speed and might. This style is dangerous for the practitioner, as it does not focus on defensive skills or self-preservation. It is especially good when used to overwhelm the techniques of North God style through force but can be weak to counters from Water God style."
89,200,"Water God Style

",Mushoku Tensei,Martial Art,"Water God Style focuses on defensive techniques and counterattacks. Typically, users wait for their enemies to make the first blow. Water God style users can avoid injury and protect allies much more effectively in combat than any other style, though they may have trouble inflicting injuries themselves. Water God users are especially good at defending from Sword God attacks through counterattacks but may have trouble defending against the unusual attacks used by North God style users."
90,200,"North God Style
",Mushoku Tensei,Martial Art,"A style that extends outside standard combat. North God Style focuses on utility, sneak attacks, psychology, and escape as ways of achieving victory. Users often pick their battles carefully or make use of strange techniques like swordplay that shines light in an enemy’s eyes, bluffing during combat, or coating weapons with poison.

no one would ever even know you were there."
93,200,Shotokan Inspired,Street Fighter,Martial Art,"While Shotokan is not the art's true name, it is the easiest term to use for
the many derivatives of the martial art. The origin of this art was ""Ansatsuken"", an assassination art
founded in Japan's Feudal Era.
 Gouken, who only wanted to embrace the peaceful and spiritual aspect of the art, developed a
sublimated variation of the same martial art style called ""Mu no Ken"". Others have also emulated
the techniques of one style or the other, creating personal variants of one of the styles.
 Whatever the case may be, fighting is in your bones, and you have through discipline and training
become a ""Shoto"", a practitioner of one of the varieties of Shotokan. Mysterious energies are
inherent in these styles as you will soon learn, and practitioners of the art seemed destined to cross
paths with many powerful individuals during their lives. "
94,200,Guru,Street Fighter,Martial Art,"When I say yoga, the first thing that comes to mind is probably impossibly painful
contortion and stretching, or resting on a bed of needles. In this world, that is only the tip of the
iceberg, as yoga is a practice aiding in spiritual enlightenment that can grant strange and unique
abilities.
 You are currently a novice compared to true masters, only possessing the ability to stretch your
skin and joints far beyond that of normal humans and levitate through the air while in a meditative
position. In time, training, study and meditation you may yet find your true potential and become a
""Yoga Master""."
95,200,Steady Watch,Street Fighter,Martial Art,"You can't always be there to prevent injustices taking place. One person can
only do so much, watch over an area so large before illegal activity begins to slip through the holes in
the net of law enforcement.
 Police don't just work in law prevention though, and upon purchase, you'll get training, skills and
experience that goes with being a decorated detective. Observe a crime scene, notice things that
others passed over entirely, get gut instincts that turn into leads.
 Learn how to apply pressure during an interrogation using a mixture of bluffs and established facts
to make the detainee crack. You're eyes see what others don't, and law breakers who slipped
through the cracks of the city, or even the world, cannot evade your detection forever."
96,200,Arsenal,Street Fighter,Martial Art,"Hands and feet only do so much. Humans proved their dominance over the natural
world through the use of tools and their ingenuity. You've decided to rely on similar means in order
to overcome the combat beasts of this world.
 Upon purchase, you gain great proficiency in the creation and use of all manner of concealable
weapons and tools. Lock picks for breaking and entering, varying simple bombs for concealing
yourself in smoke or quickly detonating something, throwing stars and knives for quick ranged
attacks during battle, blowguns for taking enemies out from concealment.
 This perk allows you to get better with similar small tools used in espionage or combat in the
future, and makes it easier to hide such things on your person."
97,200,Routines,Toriko,Martial Art,"Centered around mental images and physical movement. The higher the concentration, energy, and experience a person has with routines then the less physical movement is required to perform the routine. The lowest level of a routine requires a lot of movements and time but at its highest level it is an entirely mental action. You start with the most basic of routines where one creates a mental image of success to increase concentration and accuracy. You can increase your own concentration to the point that you don't even flinch when stabbed in a vital organ. The drawback is that it contains several movements which take time to perform, leaving you vulnerable.
"
98,200,Knocking Training,Toriko,Martial Art,"A special, non-lethal method of capturing wild beasts. It generally involves striking the nerves or pressure points that control movement of living creatures with the use of specialized techniques or the use of biodegradable needles fired from various implements known as Knocking Guns, which can paralyze beasts. This way any beast can be transported alive. 
However, the location of these nerves is different in every species so a great amount of knowledge and experience is required to use Knocking techniques or Knocking Guns effectively. 
You have a general knowledge of Knocking and with time and practice can Knock all manner of creatures. You can even use Knocking barehanded if you try hard enough."
99,200,Silent Fist,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"- You are a master of weapons, no not guns or bows. Blades, clubs, and thrown
weapons are your preference. You can give an edge to a blunt length of pipe or make a cheap knife
sharp enough to cut through tank armor. And the edges of any weapon you swing or throw will cut
through the air soundlessly. Your skill with these weapons is enough that you can kill a squad of armed
enemy soldiers in seconds without getting shot once, but against something like a Hokuto practitioner
or a Nanto master you still have a long ways to go."
100,200,Hikou Fuuji,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"As a student of Hokuto Shinken you have had training in not only utilizing an
enemy's vital points against them but also in defending yourself against your own techniques and any
similar arts you may encounter. With this method of Pressure Point Sealing you can resist attacks
against your 708 vital points, protecting yourself completely if your fighting aura or Touki is greater
than your opponent's and buying you time to reverse the effects or suppress them if you are of similar
strength. It doesn't help much if you are completely outclassed though so try not to get hit in the first
place."
101,200, Suieishin,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"Hokuto Shinken training is rigorous and a student must learn quickly lest they die
when the master demonstrates new techniques on them. You have mastered the Water Reflection Spirit
technique and can copy techniques after witnessing them once. While this allows you to use techniques
from styles you don't know, it is only in perfect mimicry and it requires further effort to properly learn
foreign techniques like this instead of simply aping the movements."
102,200,Survivalist,Reincarnator,Martial Art,"You had a weird hobby before arriving here, cooking, now with
so many different beasts and different ingredients laying around, it has given you
many ideas for different dishes, you can now turn even the ugliest monster into a

into something memorable if you put some effort."

advance all the way to the World God and Chaos Immortal Realm, the technique you get is of the
highest quality, and you won’t need to worry about your future growth being crippled by using it.

whatever Dao's you grow proficient in."
104,200,Total Concentration Breathing,Demon Slayer,Martial Art,"Can be purchased three times. Oh, now it gets interesting. After a certain point, training your body in the classical sense
just doesn't make fighting demons any easier. But! Fret not, because with this, you're now a practitioner of a
Breath Style; at the core of this technique, whatever it happens to be for you, is specialized patterns of
breathing combined with precise movements of your blade, evoking something elemental or natural with
each technique. At first, this simply makes you a fair fight for your average. demon - not the Twelve,
certainly, but someone who's had a few good meals in their lifetime - thanks to your expanded stamina,
heavily-oxygenated muscles, and precisely stylized strikes. You'll never break a blade (or spear, or mace,
or whatever else you fight with) because of a bad swing again, and as your lungs grow stronger, so do you.
Of course, this baseline assumes you're practicing an established style...but with an additional purchase of
this Perk, you develop you'll have achieved Pillar-level mastery of something more unique, a signature style
of sword-fighting that may very well be yours and yours alone, and by buying this Perk a third time, you are
the progenitor and grandmaster of a complete fighting style on par with the Breath of the Sun itself - hell, it
may not even be a sword-based fighting style. This will allow you to teach others your style as well, and like
the Breath of the Sun, there will be enough material for other skilled fighters to develop their own variations
of it if they don't have the necessary constitution."
105,200,Dishonourable Warrior: Gunslinger,Avesta of Black and White,Martial Art,"The usage of firearms is really unsuited for this universe, let alone the Yazata, who value the refinement of their sword styles and the discipline that comes to attaining power through harsh training. After all, it is a combat style that doesn’t really display one’s martial prowess nor dedication, and while it can be quite effective at the lowest levels, it doesn’t really let much room for growth.

Perhaps you can prove them wrong. Not only do you have an aim that borders the supernatural, as you are able to nail several headshots in a row and even perform trick shots even without the usage of special abilities, but you have the ability to create bullets with your your own special powers, allowing you to channel them directly into the enemy if you manage to land a hit. Which shouldn’t be hard for you."
106,200,Special Techniques,Trinity Wonder,Martial Art,"These are the required skills if one wishes to be more than just a fighter. These are the ki techniques that Murim warriors deploy in order to enhance their body and unleash powerful attacks. This is the Murim Warriors equivalent of a basic mage’s myriad of spells. With these techniques, a warrior is able to see in the dark with the Eyes of Night, walk in the air with Void Steps, strengthen their body beyond human limits, and more. With this perk comes the ki reserves necessary to make use of many of the abilities within, though the most energy intensive ones may exhaust you until you build up better reserves. You could now call yourself a proper warrior of Murim."
107,200,Revival Taekwondo/Northern ITF-Taekwondo,The God of High School Jump,Martial Art,"Two forms of martial arts developed in this world, based on enhancing ITF style Taekwondo. Originally, Northern ITF Taekwondo was developed by the North Korean Government, designed to work as a killing skill rather than for competition sports. Terrifyingly effective, it allowed incredibly high speed movement while losing none of the power of the user’s kicks, letting users of Northern ITF Taekwondo tear through even armed soldiers like paper.

Revival Taekwondo, also called Re-Taekwondo, was South Korea’s answer to this. Created by Taejin Jin with WTF Taekwondo as a base, it focused on eliminating what weaknesses remained in Northern style and enhancing the art as a whole with stealth techniques. A perfect counter to the Northern style, it progressed greatly under the hands of its founder, with techniques to manipulate air pressure or apply the force of singular attacks multiple times over being created.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"

The version you have learnt is far above the normal art that is taught however. You have learnt the Four Pillars techniques, moves that involve the manipulation and enhancement of your life energy to create incredibly destruct blows or blasts or energy.

supernatural ability, you simply know how to remain out of sight. Usually so you can make a
grand, surprise entrance. Or maybe you're just gathering information where you really shouldn't
be. On occasion, someone might overcome this, so be prepared to explain why exactly you
were using a feather duster on the ceiling in your boss' private quarters without anyone seeing
you come in."
111,200,Way of the Blade,Dragon Ball,Martial Art,"While Yajirobe is far from the strongest warrior on Earth he is still powerful. Particularly
as he was motivated to train in this world rather than laze around. He however, is
unique amongst the Z-Warriors as the only true sword user. Inspired by Yajirobe you
have honed your skills with the blade becoming a true sword user. Aside from being a
master sword user, this also can have a special effect on your ki. The Ki of a
swordsman is sharper and more overbearing than normal. This makes them stronger

compared to someone of the same level. Lastly, this perk will also give you a wide array
of knowledge regarding Ki-based sword techniques to use."
112,200,Shadow Walking Method,Generic Exalted,Martial Art,"Stealth and you are old friends. The shadows welcome you,
traveler, and in turn you embrace them like an old companion. Whenever you are seeking to go
unnoticed, so long as there are shadows to duck into, you will invariably find them. Almost as if
you were drawn to them, and they to you. You’re not the stealthiest thing around by any means,
not yet at least, but this innate talent of yours will see you in good stead and if you put in the
time to practice you may yet be able to go as unseen as the wind itself."

They can manifest it, like a tiny star in their hands, but any power they use is taken away from the Starseed's growth.

You may choose what each stud is made out of, however, it can’t be indestructible and you must have it either on you or in your warehouse."
132,400,Atomic Slash,One Punch Man,Martial Art,"The signature move of Atomic Samurai, the Atomic Slash, allows you to unleash a series of sword strikes so fast and precise that they are nearly impossible to follow with the naked eye. In a single instant, you can perform hundreds of slashes, cutting through opponents with precision and devastating speed. Your enemies won't even realize they've been hit until it's too late. This technique makes you a whirlwind of steel on the battlefield, capable of dismantling even the toughest foes with ease."
133,400,"Master of Sorcery",Baki The Grappler,Martial Art,"Aiki, the esoteric practice that gave birth to Aikido. Along with the basic traits of using an
opponent’s power against them, with just a light squeeze, you can exploit a foe’s reflexes
to bring giants to their knees or flying. You also have a grasp of your own orientation that
lets you jump around like a master acrobat and reduce the force of impacts. "
134,400,Traditional Ninja,Street Fighter,Martial Art,"Ninja, throughout myth and legend, are capable of a number of supernatural
abilities. Breathing fire, summoning familiars to do their bidding, melting into the shadows and so
on. While that reputation is inflated, there is some truth in the tales of their prowess.
 This perk grants you the full package of traditional mythical ninjutsu training. You can run across
water or vertical surfaced, leap from tree branch to tree branch in relative silence, use kites for
temporary flight, move without making a sound and conceal yourself by walking into shadows.
 More importantly, you have the direct combat applications as well, such as flying kicks reaching
out much farther than onlookers would expect, and complicated grappling techniques involving
spinning, leaping and incredible body control.
 The truly magical abilities like controlling the elements and summoning animals are just myth and
legend, but you are far more dangerous nonetheless than most can predict nonetheless."
135,400,Tandem Style,Street Fighter,Martial Art,"Martial Arts have countless possibilities, but a single art will always have clear
limitations, strengths and weaknesses that only become more pronounced the higher the level you
fight at. You will do away with this and seek limitlessness.
 This perk grants incredible skill with blending martial arts you hold mastery over into a single,
unified, more powerful style with time and training. Combining techniques even becomes possible,
discarding the flaws while keeping the strengths.
 Work to fuse a style focusing on pressure points with another based on bone breaking kicks,
creating a style that focuses on kicks so powerful and precises that they can cripple with a glancing
blow using the joint principles.
 While it should be obvious, it's also noteworthy that this perk allows you to easily shift between
any of the martial art styles you've practiced during combat as seamlessly as putting one foot in
front of the other. "
136,400,Enbu,Toriko,Martial Art,"Also known as Monkey Dance is a form of martial arts discipline as well as a form of ranking system that is unique to the inhabitants of Area 7. The way of Enbu is no simple matter as it is based around working with the body as a whole. This unison of the body must be performed on a cellular level meaning that in order to master Enbu, every single cell within an individual's body must cooperate together and put aside the differing emotions and thoughts which separate them from each other. Fully mastering Enbu would allow individuals to perform feats of strength and focus that would normally kill individuals.  Jumpers start with bare basics that allow them to form the most basic cell unison, a state where all cells work together in fight or flight situations. With practice, one could reach the level of Enbu presented by Bambina and perform similar feats that he showed. "
137,400,Shinobi Training,Saint Seiya Omega,Martial Art,"As one of the rare Saints hailing from a hidden shinobi village, you have
mastered the ancient art of the shinobi, blending it seamlessly with your Saintly
abilities. Drawing upon the principles of ninjutsu, your proficiency and strategic
acumen are comparable to that of a Chunin from the renowned Naruto series.
With a formidable arsenal of techniques at your disposal, you navigate the
battlefield with grace and precision, utilizing stealth, deception, and precise
strikes to outmaneuver your adversaries."
138,400,Taizan Tenrou Ken,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"You have learned and mastered a fighting style that allows you to chop
chunks of flesh away from your opponents so fast that it inflicts a sensation of bitter cold before death."
139,400,Self-Taught Style,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"You are no mere disciple in the art of combat, you are a master of your
own style. Through hard experience and rigorous training you've created a style all your own that may
not be the best for others, but in your hands it can match even the most legendary of styles and
techniques. Even if you face a master of an incredible style like Hokuto Shinken, you can fight evenly
with their best and what decides the match won't be who has the more impressive technique, but who is
tougher, stronger, faster, and just plain physically better."
140,400, Gou no Ken,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"By some strange means you have learned Raoh's personal fighting style. This
fighting art demands immense strength of both body and spirit, strength that a practitioner uses to
destroy everything in their path. However since Raoh made this style it contains no means to attain
such power and is useless if you do not have strength far beyond mortal men from some other source.
If you have the strength to use it though, then no method of blocking, no armor, and no obstacle can
protect your foes from the force of your blows."
141,400,Hokuto Ryuken,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"You have traveled far and wide across these hellish lands and somehow
attained mastery of Hokuto Ryuken. This art is a rival style to Hokuto Shinken and as a master of it
you can utilize the 1109 Keiraku Hakou pressure points as well as generate a Matouki aura. While you
have the power and skill to defeat a Hokuto Shinken successor even if they know Musou Tensei with
your demonic fighting spirit and destructive pressure points you must always maintain an iron will lest
you fall into madness you may never recover from."
142,400,Nanto Goshasei,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"You know one of the five style of the
guardians sworn to protect the Last Nanto General. It could be the Garyuu no Ken of Juza of the
Clouds which is comprised of rapid kicks and grappling techniques which in the hands of a master can
even be a threat to Raoh, the Gosha Enjou Ken of Shuren of the Flames which is a strange art that lets
one manipulate flames while protecting you from the heat, the Gosha Fuuretsu Ken of Hyui of the
Wind which lets you manipulate the air itself to cut apart foes and enhance your speed, the Gosha
Hasui Ken of Rihaku of the Ocean which lets one strike with the force of a tidal wave using flying
attacks, or the Gosha Sanga Zan of Fudoh of the Mountains in which you use your strength and size to
crush and overwhelm foes."
143,400,Hokuto Shinken,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"You are one of the rare few that have learned the art of Hokuto Shinken
and retain the ability to use these skills despite not being the Successor. You have complete knowledge
of Hokuto Shinken's techniques and can perform most of them ably, but the most advanced techniques
will require further training or perhaps something else you have yet to attain. You could match the
likes of Toki, Raoh, and Kenshiro in the art although without something more than this you will lose if
you face them seriously."
144,400,Acupuncture Master,Tales Of Demons and Gods,Martial Art,"The meridians of the body
govern the flow of energy from the soul, striking one can cause an
opponent to lose their ability to move or paralyze them for a short
period of time. You know all of the acupressure and meridian
points of anyone simply by looking at them, and, when used, you
can unlock the potential of a person's body simply with a few
silver needles. This may or may not cause excruciating pain at
the time of use, depending on the individual."
145,400,Personal Fighting Style,Reincarnator,Martial Art,"Before arriving at the <Otherworld>, you were
already a seasoned fighter, and now this place allow you to shine even further with
the superhuman abilities that runes, traits and skills can grant, you can now

seamlessly integrate your skills, artifacts and body quirks in a personal fighting style,
that will always fully integrate your skills and body into a machine of death."
146,400,Shadow Assassin,Bleach,Martial Art,"A true rogue, be it under the title of ninja or spy or assassin. Your skills with covert movement have
progressed to the point that few fortresses can hope to keep you out or detect you at all and even
sneaking around an active battlefield is quite possible. To the untrained eye, you could even pass
through an empty street in the middle of the day without notice. Even high speed movement like
Shunpo doesn’t adversely affect your ability to move stealthily much. Though most fitting for a
Shinigami, you also have a wide range of skills fitting to the duties of a Onmitsukido member, from interrogation tactics to sentry duty. You can hide both your presence and your Reiatsu with ease, a well practiced technique that only masters can see through, which can even help mask the use of Kido or other spiritual techniques. Perhaps the most useful skills are those in relation to the work of an assassin, both lethal and nonlethal methods to neutralise foes without being seen. You’re an expert at striking exact points
and vulnerabilities to take out powerful foes, well trained in varying arts of assassination. Weaving it
into your fighting style to cleverly disguise an extra attack or dirty trick isn’t hard, even when fighting
in the open against someone who knows to expect dishonorable methods from you. "
147,400,Clan Arts,The God of High School Jump,Martial Art,"You’re a rare instance of a human who has gained supernatural abilities beyond raw physical abilities through training, instead of relying on a Charyeok or Divine heritage. You were trained in the Ninja arts from the day you were born. Whilst this has left your stealth skills unparalleled, even letting you sneak through many magical wards, the secret techniques you have learnt are much more useful. You can substitute your body for nearby objects at super high speeds, as well as the bodies of those nearby. You can pin people’s shadows to the floor with sharp objects, trapping them unless they are immensely strong or you pull the knife from their shadow. You are even able to craft minor illusions over yourself, step between nearby shadows and create a limited number of clones, though these clones will be much weaker then you and likely serve only as a distraction."
148,400,Psyharden Sword Technique,Chrome Shelled Regios,Martial Art,"Like Layfon Alseif, Derek Psyharden, Haia Salinvan Lyia, and many before them you are a master of all of the Psyharden Sword Techniques. As for what Psyharden techniques actually are, they are a sword school that has an absurd range of techniques from Kei needles to strikes that disrupt the internals of your enemies. A great many of the known techniques are ones that emit Kei from their Katana. You have even taken a step further and can use these techniques with other weapons or even your bare fists. As a wielder of Psyharden techniques your Kei has reached the limit of how dense and pure it can become, and can easily use energy techniques and martial arts with any weapons you wield.
"
149,400,Teachings of the Kai,Dragon Ball,Martial Art,"The North Kai may seem like a rather unimpressive fighter, but he is actually a skilled
martial artist. Some of his most notable techniques include the Kaio-Ken and the Spirit
Bomb. You have been taught by King Kai and learned all of the techniques he has
gained throughout his life. The Kaio-Ken allows the user to multiply their overall power
at the cost of straining their body. The Spirit Bomb on the other hand is an attack that
gathers energy from the surrounding area and any living beings. Both of these attacks
are designed to fight enemies far beyond the user’s level. Purchasing this perk will
make you a master of each of these techniques."
150,400,Backhanded Deflection,One finger Death Punch,Martial Art,"The merits of Death Punch shine with its defence. A practitioner deep in concentration and focus
may swat away lesser blows without thinking, their limbs moving subconsciously to continue the
flow of the art. This deflection only works when many foes are felled or with effort from the user."
151,400,Way of the Infernal Fist,Infernals Exalted,Martial Art,"Not quite fiefdom, nor quite temple, but surely greater than a mere building are the fighting
academies of Malfeas. Here worthy students are accepted into an academy to learn the
infernal martial arts and various armed fighting styles. While unworthy students are either
rejected, accepted only to be used for sparring practice and manual labor or killed outright.
You were one of the worthy ones, accepted in a Malfean school and taught the ways of
martial combat.
Perhaps you found the Ten Shadows Academy in the wake of the Ebon Dragon and learned
of the ten principles exemplified by the Ten Shadows, those principles of assassination,
obfuscation, misdirection, interrogation, seduction, betrayal, deception, secrecy, persistence
and the poisoning of the spirit. Perhaps you joined the brutal school of Suntarankal, and
endured the ruthless and callous nature of this Unquestionable to train for seven years in
hellish regimens from which many students leave injured, crippled, or outright destroyed.
Perhaps you joined any of the hundreds or thousands of other schools. Perhaps you simply
relied on your own talent and gained understanding of the brutal Infernal Monster style in the
frequent battles on the streets of Malfeas. Or perhaps you apprenticed directly to a demon
master, as Mara may teach you the Black Claw style that is her creation.
But regardless of where you learned to fight, you do it well. The forms of your martial arts
come easy to you, the shaping and manipulation of your essence into new patterns
accomplished with supreme skill, and so too may you learn or even develop entirely new
styles of combat and the martial arts with far less time and effort than most would require."
152,500,Martial Artist - Boosted,UQ Holder,Martial Art,"You wouldn’t look out of place leading one of those ancient martial arts temples up in the mountains, since you’ve now got all the martial and chi skill of one of the old and great masters. Your life energy is nearly boundless, enough to quite literally suffocate ordinary people, and when you actually turn it to violent use, you could split a mountain in two or leave an entire country in ruins over the course of a single nasty afternoon. Your mastery of the uses of Chi is incredibly widespread, giving you control over the elements, incredible healing abilities, and immense physical power. You do not quite match the Magic option above in raw power, due to your increased innate versatility, but there are only two dozen beings that would be above you in power now."
153,500,Combat Stylist - Boosted,UQ Holder,Martial Art,"You’ve taken the art of the blade, or whatever other weapon you chose, to the very limit of what is possible and some might say even beyond that. Of the four power options available here, this one is the most limited in breadth, and for that you gain significantly more power. When using your chosen weapons or style of combat, you become one of the stronger beings in this world. The destruction of cities or even entire islands is within reach of your power, so long as your weapon can hold up, and you can hold back even the Thousand Master for a few minutes. You wouldn’t win against that monstrous fighter, but the act of surviving against his full power for that long? You can count on two hands the number of people that can go toe to toe with you now."
154,500,Ninja Training - Boosted,UQ Holder,Martial Art,"It’s a shame that your village is no longer around to see how far you’ve come since your days as a young ninja in training. They might not be able to believe their eyes if they saw you. If they could even see you! A master Ninja like yourself has unmatched abilities of stealth, to the point that you can disappear into nothingness or shadow at any time, command the shadows and elements to attack with you, and even summon a small army of clones of yourself to fight alongside you. You’re a master at combat and at using all your varying ninja tools, likely having made and popularized a fair few ninja tools in your own adventures too. In terms of power, you won’t be busting up whole cities at once, but you do have a much broader skillset than any mage or monk. You’re skilled in chi, stealth, combat, espionage, and a huge range of skills needed to make convincing disguises as varying professions. Hell, you don’t even need to be a Ninja for anything but fun with all the skills and knowledge you have; you could just start a business of some kind and see the cash roll in."
155,500,Sword Spirit,One Punch Man,Martial Art,"Your mastery of the sword has reached a supernatural level. You can now project slashes from your blade over long distances, cutting through enemies even if they are far from your reach. This ability allows you to strike at foes that are out of range, as the sheer spirit of your swordsmanship extends beyond the physical limits of your blade. You can cut through multiple enemies, obstacles, or even manipulate the trajectory of your slashes mid-air. "
156,500,Senjutsu Apprentice,Street Fighter,Martial Art,"Senjutsu, the Sage Arts, is the name of a Chinese martial art of mythical
and legendary proportions. It is said to have been used by the immortal mountain hermits of Taoist
myth, and is centred on the exercise and mastery of one's Ki.
 Training and studying is extremely rigorous, demanding and time consuming. So much so that only
those who are utmost willing to learn its secrets in the years needed to master it can even take their
first steps in its ways.
 Upon purchase, you become a beginner in the esoteric art of Senjutsu. This makes you stronger,
faster and more agile than any normal human on a passive level. Your martial arts prowess is
incredible, your Ki becomes far more potent as well as automatically unlocked and your body and
health are extremely resilient. After many years of additional study and training in this secretive art, you may yet become a
Sennin. Doing so would grant a host of near mythical abilities, such as manifesting your by then
extremely potent Ki into a corporeal form and emulate telekinesis, survive in barren and
inhospitable environments that would kill normal humans and what is effectively immortality that
allows you to put a stop the process of aging and stay in peak physical condition well over the time
others would have crumbled to dust."
157,500,Knocking Mastery,Toriko,Martial Art,"Decades of Knocking experience are yours to draw on. You now have an in-depth knowledge on Knocking of all the most common creatures and some rare creatures. You can now even use knocking on living organisms with bizarre nervous systems like arthropods.
True Masters of Knocking have even turned it into a form of martial arts and some can even Knock using only sheer intimidation. It's said that the most powerful forms of Knocking even work on the inanimate like natural disasters, attacks and something like Time itself.
"
158,500,Muscle Motion Mastery,Toriko,Martial Art,"That ability centers around manipulation of muscle movement rather than flow of time. Allows users to stop, revert, or accelerate movements in a certain area, allowing him to cancel an unfavorable turn of events and instantly modify user tactics to gain the upper hand. Whoever is subject to the technique is fully aware of what is going on, if they could perceive it, even though they cannot counter it."
159,500,Nanto Roku Seiken,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"You somehow possess the
knowledge and skill of a successor to one of the six strongest Nanto Masters. There are only five true
fighting arts among these individuals but these arts are almost unrivaled in their power. You could be a
practitioner of Nanto Haurou Ken the kicking based style that also lets one destroy the enemy with
open hand attacks, Kento Houou Ken the free-form style with only one stance that focuses on
incredible speed and power, Nanto Koukaku Ken the style which uses vertical long range ki attacks,
Nanto Koshuu Ken the style that uses rapid hands strikes to stab the enemy along with flying kicks, or
Nanto Suichou Ken the graceful style that has destructive power without equal and lets the user
slaughter enemies with devastating slicing techniques."
160,500,Hokuto Ujouken,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"You have followed in Toki's footsteps and begun turning the lethal style
of Hokuto Shinken into a means of healing. You can not only use your knowledge of the 708 vital
points to heal people better, but you have a knowledge of modern medicine that matches any
professional doctor from before the world ended. Lastly your fighting style exemplifies your desire to
do no harm as you are supremely skilled in dodging, countering, and turning an opponent's power
against them, you win contests of strength no matter the medium by forcing your opponent to defeat
them self this is not effortless though and it can be exhausting to redirect forces too far above your own
power."
161,600,The Sanctioned Action,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Martial Art,"...is to cut. There is only one, maybe two people in the entire Multiverse that have the skill to cut. And it is much more than just cutting something with a sword. To Cut means division by the blade of Want, that parer of potentials that excises infinities. And by cutting, you cut not only the physical, but the universe itself. At the point where you start at, it is “merely” the ability to cut through anything not completely invincible. But by studying and growing the act of cutting, you will grow in Strength. At the end of the road for this, you will be able to cut anything, no matter how strong or durable or esoteric or abstract it is. Not only that, but you can cut people without so much as drawing your sword, and cut things just by touching them. You can also project a “laser” from the tip of your sword, and it cuts as well as you can."
162,600,Ki Rata,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Martial Art,"An internal/external discipline, widely respected as the most dangerous Fist Art in the multiverse. Its core technique is a breathing method that allows internal force to be cultivated extremely rapidly and focused on a point smaller than a pin-prick, giving blows absolutely phenomenal power. Blows using this technique are named by the number of points they contain – one point blows are strong enough to crack stone with a touch. Two point blows can decapitate a man with the air pressure created by flicking a finger. Legends about of old masters of Ki Rata using ten point blows to level cities.

Ki Rata, once a feared secret held by the Monks of the Silent Voice, is now fully at your command. As you move through combat, time seems to slow, your enemies barely able to comprehend your movements before they fall to your power. 

Mastery of this Art grants access to the forbidden technique known as the Forbidden Temple Art: Slayer of Immortals. This ultimate form unlocks every energy channel within the body, causing the practitioner’s Atum to erupt in a wild, consuming blaze, multiplying their power ten-thousandfold—though at immense personal cost. In this state, the user becomes a living conduit of divine force, their body burning from within as they wield strength great enough to challenge even the gods. Legend holds that the creation of this technique was was driven by fear of divine return—a way for mortals to stand against the heavens."
163,600,Monster Calamity God Slayer Fist,One Punch Man,Martial Art,"The Monster Calamity God Slayer Fist is the ultimate culmination of martial prowess, developed by Garou in his monsterized state. This martial art is a synthesis of every fighting style you’ve ever encountered, honed into a flawless technique without weak points. It maximizes both power and speed, allowing you to overwhelm your enemies with an endless barrage of strikes, each hit carrying destructive force capable of shattering even the most formidable opponents.

Your strikes not only harness immense physical power but are also imbued with a malevolent, monstrous energy, turning each blow into a calamity. This technique allows you to predict, counter, and dismantle any fighting style, thanks to your heightened observational abilities and mastery of absorbed techniques. You can fight multiple opponents at once, effortlessly deflecting their attacks and retaliating with bone-crushing force.

In its perfected form, this style can slice through massive beings and structures with a single strike, as demonstrated by Garou’s ability to cleave a titanic enemy in half from space to Earth. The Monster Calamity God Slayer Fist embodies the peak of martial arts evolution, turning you into an unstoppable force capable of bringing even ""gods"" to their knees."
164,600,One with the Blade,One Punch Man,Martial Art,"You have reached the ultimate level of swordsmanship, becoming one with your blade. At this level, your sword is an extension of your being, and with each strike, you achieve perfect harmony between mind, body, and weapon. Your attacks transcend the physical realm, becoming almost ethereal. With one slash, you can cut through not only physical matter but also energy, dimensions, and even concepts like time and space. Nothing is beyond your reach—no opponent is too strong, no defense is too impenetrable. You have achieved absolute mastery, and those who face you are already defeated."
165,600,Dark Techniques,Toriko,Martial Art,"Kitchen techniques prohibited by the IGO in fear of upsetting the circulation of food, even though they have been mostly used to revitalize humans and beasts for healing purposes.
In order to use these techniques, a Revitalizing Kitchen Knife is required and a near superhuman ability to pass the knife in the gaps between cells without damaging them.
One could with them eat ingredients almost indefinitely thanks to regenerating properties of Revitalizing Kitchen Knife.
Techniques included here are one allowing the user to revitalize ally from distance, changing the personality of target by leaving special bacteria in the brain and a special one that allows the user to cook regardless of their state.
"
166,600,Musou Tensei,Fist Of The North Star,Martial Art,"The ultimate technique of Hokuto Shinken is yours. By embracing the true
nature of sorrow you have awakened to a near invincible state of mind that renders you impervious to
physical attacks and allows you to commune with the souls of those that were close to you but have
passed on to utilize their knowledge and techniques."
167,600,Houyi’s Archery,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Martial Art,"This is a Jade Slip detailing the mythical art of Houyi’s Archery, the
Archery art created by the undisputed number one expert of Archery in the Three Realms, a man

called the Divine Archer whose mythical legend of shooting down nine suns is a true and verified
feat, if slightly different from the legend. With this art you could consistently fight on even terms
with those in a higher realm than you. This however doesn’t just detail the art of Houyi’s Archery
found across the Three Realms, but instead includes an updated portion from the insights Houyi
himself gained after his short disappearance from the Three Realms. When one manages to reach
the same level of Heartforce he had, the fifth stage, one may even be capable of shooting arrows
that as an Empyrean God could turn the head of an Elder God and demolish a True God, and as a
True God could even devour the Truesoul of someone on the level of an Elder God, though this
would be just a normal Elder God."
168,600,Wild Style,Demon Slayer,Martial Art,"You're more than just a warrior - you're a copycat, a mimic, a combat
improvisationalist. Not only can you think on your feet in a fight, but your style can accommodate basically
any cool technique (or supernatural power, if you could do it with the proper training) you come across. This
isn't quite instantaneous; you have to see someone else do it, for one, and you have to try it out, for
another, but so long as you're capable of it, you can copy it."
169,600,Sword Goddess,Bleach,Martial Art,"It’s easy to think that every Kenpachi is a violent brute. They all favour sheer power and strength, even those that have some technique or intelligence in battle prefer to channel it into using their natural power. But it didn’t start that way. The very first of this line relied not on furious power but on graceful skill. Graceful, terrifying, murderous skill. The countless styles of swordsmanship that Unohana Yachiru mastered in pursuit of the perfection of dealing death were passed down to you, maybe from the woman herself, rendering you her equal in Zanjutsu at least. The myriad styles have endless applications and intended uses, from barbaric greatswords to precise rapiers. Styles to allow the effortless counter-attacks to almost any blow, turning the enemy’s strength against them, or to cut away at the spiritual components of the enemy. Your skill is hardly limited to just what a mortal human would see as physically possible and the techniques you’re aware of make you capable of easily laying low those more powerful than yourself. Unohana, even centuries after she put down her blade, still easily killed the mighty Zaraki many times over despite his physical advantages. If desired, you can exchange this talent in swordsmanship for similar skill for another armed weapon form. Spears or hammers or axes or some of the wilder tools the Shinigami employ. Unarmed combat is unavailable as a choice but otherwise you’ll attain the same vast breadth and depth of skill with your chosen weapon form."
170,600,Shunko,Bleach,Martial Art,"The pinnacle of Hakuda techniques, combining Kido or Magic with an intense mastery of the martial
arts. The Flash War Cry is a transformation that drives intensely focused Reiryoku into the user’s
limbs and projects it from their back. The most basic effect is an enormous enhancement in speed
and strength, as well as the ability to instantly negate any attack by focusing the Shunko energy in
equal amounts to the targeted point, a costly defence but one able to outright cancel both damaging
attacks and more esoteric magical effects. Each Shunko technique has a unique element associated with it, all with their own advantages. Wind, lightning and fire have all been seen so far. Wind is much easier to keep active for longer periods and enhances agility exceptionally, lightning grants even greater speed and thus attack power, fire
endowed the user with explosive attack power. Other elemental attributes are possible and
whatever your choice, you’ll be able to freely convert your Reiryoku into the element and control it
around you. It enables some devastating techniques and at your level of mastery, opens up a
uniquely powerful benefit fitting to your element. The rotating vortexes of a Wind Shunko might give
indefinitely recycle Reiatsu that allows the Shunko to remain permanently active, while Lightning
might focus into monstrously powerful final blasts of energy instead. Having reached a mastery of Shunko, you’ll find it far easier to combine magic and martial arts in the
future, both as a useful combat style that weaves the two together and in making entirely new
techniques or transformations based on combined principles from the differing styles."
171,600,Kinsmen of Claw,Ragna Crimson,Martial Art,"The Bloodline of Claws is not one necessarily made out of dragons descended from their Monarch, the Severing Dragon Gilzea, but instead they are made out of those she picks as her disciples, be they human or dragon. Considering that the mere presence of Gilzea is enough to paralyze even high dragons with fears, merely joining her Bloodline is quite the feat. And not only did you join and learned her martial arts, but you managed to pass with flying colors, making Gilzea herself recognize you as one of her Kinsmen of Claws. This means that, whatever your race is, you are clearly one of the strongest individuals in this world, with a personal might that approaches that of the Second Seats of the Bloodlines at the very least. And that it is without taking into account any other magics that you may have.

There is a second boon to be gained from this: you have gained one Gilzea’s Claws. Whether you took it from another member in combat or she crafted it for you, this demonic weapon that you can call at your side at any time is one of tremendous power, for it grows alongside you, always making you stronger while you wield it, as well as being a perfect channel for your abilities."
172,600,Legendary Shinobi,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Martial Art,"Already a legend of the shadows, you are a master ninja that will be looked up to for generations to
come, a legend carved out that even modern times will know the stories of. Your mastery of the
ninja arts is complete, resulting in superhuman skill in intelligence gathering, torture, larceny,
infiltration, assassination, ninja jutsu, ninja tools, combat and more. Despite relatively little physical
power, you pose a deadly threat even to great youkai or heroic warriors, as long as you catch them
off guard. Magic spells are as ineffective as mundane guards in detecting your presence when you
wish to conceal it and you possess many mystical techniques, similar to magecraft but specialised for
the shinobi arts. Shadows, blood, poison and more can be made and manipulated into varied but useful forms for your work. Your mere presence, even when concealed, can exude a potent aura of
death when desired. It creates a paranoia based sickness in your enemies, steadily applying
worsening physical effects as you face them. A matter of minutes in combat but days of stalking out
of it, this can begin as a sick feeling but progress to a variety of illnesses from the stress of your
waiting blades.

Suitably given your legendary nature, you are more than capable of founding your own ninja clan. Passing down any ninja art or related skill becomes simple, your students learning swiftly with only
basic instructions and capable of progressing to similar superhuman levels as you over time, with the
right experiences to help them grow. "
