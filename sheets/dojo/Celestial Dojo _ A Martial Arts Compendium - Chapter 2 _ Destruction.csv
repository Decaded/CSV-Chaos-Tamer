1,50,Prince of Hell,Infernals Exalted,Destruction,"The Infernal Exalted are wicked princes, blindingly radiant in the awful glory of the Demon
Realm. In the Yozis’ names, they will wrest Creation from the usurper gods who stole it and
the caretaker Exalted who continue to squabble over it.
Fittingly then, you may focus your anger into projecting an aura of menace to shake your
enemies’ resolve. Alternatively, you choose to gain the ability to assume an air of graceful,
yet alien nobility to express your nature as a Prince of Hell. Or project an unnerving
wrongness that is palpable in your every movement and agitates those who look upon you,
akin to the alien wonder of the demon realm. You may buy this up to three times, gaining
ones of these auras per purchase."
2,100,Martyr,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"So many people die without getting anywhere. Most people died expecting something great, only to be let down and alone in their last moments. But at least you can bring them down with you. If you were to die, you would kill the person who killed you. No matter what protection a person has, if you die, they die. However, this only works when you are killed by another sentient being: jumping off a cliff, nor slitting your own wrists, will work."
3,100,Hard Bitten,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"One of the flaws of fighting with your own body is how fragile your form is, with the flesh ripping and bones breaking after a few strikes on the enemy. Not anymore. Now, you can no longer wound your own body by striking something too hard, or too often. This isn’t to say you are gonna survive your body being overloaded with energy, nor is it gonna protect against external attacks, but you no longer have to worry about hitting something too hard."
4,100,Rage,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"Like any beast, you can go into a berserker rage. You feel no pain, can take much more punishment, and brutalize your enemies even more than usual. However, when you are out of this rage, all the pain and damage you ignored will come flooding in a single moment."
5,100,"Wasp’s Sting",Baki The Grappler,Destruction,"Like a bear trap, you can prepare your unconscious body to strike anything that gets too
close. If you’re suddenly knocked unconscious in battle, this will be a one-time lethal
attack using all your might. If you’re just sleeping normally, it’ll be a much weaker strike,
that’ll knock out just about anything that would try to touch you. Togglable. "
6,100,Chill of the Grave,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Destruction,"Fear of death is not merely a sign of cowardice - it is
the way things should be. And no one embodies death better than the servants of Hades
himself. You are intimidating and imposing, able to inspire fear in weak hearts and wary caution
in the strong. You may even have an aura of gloom and icy cold air around you to emphasize
this, should you so wish it."
7,100,Slaughter Mode,Bleach,Destruction,"With a few modifications, even a normal child can be made into a deadly warrior. A few spiritual
alterations and a new state is unlocked, a mental mode that can come over you when hostilities
arise. Provided you don’t hold yourself back, you’ll enter a trance state that enables you to fight at
full efficiency. Fear, worry, kindness and any sort of risk erased from your mind as you are turned
into a perfect killing machine. Pain and damage won’t slow you down as your mind sharpens to the
best uses of what you have available, as well as to how best to cause damage to anyone in your way.
It’ll help you fight at the best you can without character flaws getting in the way but it can also make
you recklessly pursue foes until destruction, especially without an ally to pull you out early. Who
knows what Urahara was thinking, doing this sort of thing to kids."
8,100,Blood Reaper,Bleach,Destruction,"You kill, you die, you live, you kill, you die. The cycle continues forever and the only thing that’ll
remain the same is death. Why not have a little fun along the way? If you let it, the fight for life will
really start getting your blood going. It’s a whole lot easier to push yourself further and ignore the
pain when you’re having such an absolute blast butchering everything in front of you. This bloody
way of life you can let yourself indulge in heightens your instincts in combat, naturally guiding you to
cause more damage and fight on longer. The natural intent you can put into every blow can even
leak into your Reiatsu as it emits, shaping it into a fearsome shape. "
9,100,Stealth Efficiency,Naruto - Ōtsutsuki Clan Jump,Destruction,"The strong rules the weak, so how can the weak
defeat the strong? Like how two brilliant NEETs from another universe always say,
the weak’s weapons against the strong are their intelligence and strategy, not their
power. Apparently, you learned a different lesson from this ideology: no one,
regardless of their power, can prepare themselves from an attack they don’t know is
coming, including those stronger than you. Your attacks are twice as effective and
powerful when used against an unadvised opponent, but this power boost loses its
effect once they perceive your presence. This is perfect for a first surprise attack to
end a fight before it starts, letting even a weaker servant defeat a stronger master."
10,100,Finishing Move,Dragon Ball,Destruction,"Finishing moves also known as super moves are powerful techniques that draw out the
user's power. These techniques typically must be charged up, but they allow the user to
unleash power far beyond their limits. For example, some of the Z-Fighters super
moves could multiply their attack power by 300%. This perk allows you to supercharge
your techniques as well. This is mainly done by gathering energy to condense the skill.
Additionally, the longer you charge the attack the stronger it will grow. Though it may
become difficult to contain after a certain point."
11,100,Blood Demon,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Destruction,"You have the ruthless bloodthirst and sheer ferocity that would make you fit right in with the
Blood Demon Sect.
When you want to be, you’re an incarnation of slaughter and massacre given form, a
murdering, slaying demon who could kill hundreds or thousands without a hint of hesitation or
scruples. Going into this mode is a mental switch for you to flick, and even in the depth of your
madness you retain enough rationality to flick it back, but until you do... worlds beware.
As a direct effect, you also gain an aura that follows you, a subtle yet overwhelming air of
blood and death, inspiring terror and awe in all that behold you. The more you kill and maim,
the stronger this aura grows, until you could start subduing nations and ending wars just by
showing up."
12,100,Steel Loosing Hand,One finger Death Punch,Destruction,"Death Punch is an accurate art, even when using melee weapons in unconventional ways. You can
throw such unwieldy weapons as if they were perfectly balanced. Practice may even cause their
weapons to ricochet in deadly angles, axe heads, clubs and spears spinning in deadly trajectories."
13,100,Foe Weakening Focus,One finger Death Punch,Destruction,"Death Punch turns weak foes into chaff, and with focus you may find even experienced martial
artists vulnerable to your touch. This meditation requires significant exertion to activate."
14,200,Squash the Dog’s Back,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"There must be something in you, because when you strike someone, you hit hard. Your attacks seem to have a gratuitous amount of gore and bloodiness to them, and it is even more painful than the attack would have been normally. While it also boosts the damage you do to people, it’s not by much."
15,200,"Army Defying
","A Cultivator's Beginning",Destruction,"You cannot be overwhelmed by mere numbers. If an enemy would not present a threat to you in a one-on-one battle, then any number of similarly skilled foes are equally useless in the face of your martial prowess.

"
16,200,"So Many Different Points",Baki The Grappler,Destruction,"The ability to cut with your bare hands is a surprising common skill here, but you take it
to the next level. You can cleanly cut through not only flesh but stone. You can cut a plastic
bag in freefall or slice a metal wire while barely bending it. You don’t even need all your
fingers to cut, just a knuckle should suffice. –"
17,200,"Preparedness to Kill",Baki The Grappler,Destruction,"A warrior should be equipped to win both battles of the body and mind. You know just
how to poke and prod to set people over the edge, and when to pull back to keep them
behind that edge. Whether it be catching an opponent off-guard, pushing them into a
blind rage, or making sure they don’t take you seriously enough to go for the kill. –"
18,200,"In for a Penny, in for a Pound of Flesh",Baki The Grappler,Destruction,"Training? Guns? Numbers? All is for naut against true battle experience. You have no issue
taking on entire armed groups on your lonesome. The more you kill, the larger groups you
can take on, and the stronger individuals you can challenge. With a few wars under your
belt, taking on a small army or a stone-skinned monster is child’s play "
19,200,Power of Rage,Tekken,Destruction,"An Animal fights at their strongest when cornered. When pushed to your limits
and nearing defeat you find your Rage giving you strength. Your attacks will be more powerful than
before in this state and you could focus all your Energy in a final attack trying to take your opponent
out but it would leave you without the Rage boost for the Rest of the Fight so make it count."
20,200,Counter Hit,Street Fighter,Destruction,"A counter is a very simplistic manoeuvre, you're probably already aware of how
they work. You attack an enemy when they open up their guard to attack you, either defending
against their attack first, avoiding it or attacking them first. This isn't that.
 Upon purchase, you gain the ability to ""counter hit"" enemies. This means if you strike someone
while they're attacking you, your own attack becomes more intense, causing it to deal more damage
and potentially even send them staggering, opening them up for a continued offensive."
21,200,Fighting Dirty,Saint Seiya Omega,Destruction,"Having long abandoned the shackles of pride, you have embraced the art of
fighting with foul play as your modus operandi. Whether through holding
someone's family hostage or threatening to desecrate a cherished grave, you
have mastered the manipulation of underhanded tactics to gain the upper hand.
Skilled at getting the drop on even the most seasoned warriors, you excel at
destroying trust between allies by pressing the right buttons and exploiting
vulnerabilities. Moreover, your proficiency in executing sneak attacks has made
them more effective than frontal assaults, allowing you to strike swiftly and
decisively without warning."
22,200,Ankle Protection,Reincarnator,Destruction,"A usual problem of this place is that when you make
enemies and don’t finish them off, they will manage to somehow get back at you out
of pettiness, now you are exempt of this big issue, if you beat sense into someone,
they will listen and behave, that is, if they aren’t one of the madman who roam
around, these people might need a more “permanent” solution, call it culling the
weeds."
23,200,<Punisher>,Reincarnator,Destruction,"You have a different aura than others, when in your presence,
the wicked feels raw fear, this will make leaders of any kind seek you in order to hunt
down the vile and evil, giving you the fame of a fair and reliable person, your mere
presence makes people more compelling to follow the rules, but know that it will only
have effect if you abide by these same rules and uphold them using your might."
24,200,Angel of Death,Bleach,Destruction,"It can be easy for people to forget that the motherly doctor looking after them knows the most
efficient ways to slice your body apart. You’ve got such a gentle demeanour when you desire, others
naturally feel at ease and even the most violent and rowdy allies tend to calm down and behave
around you. Those that still refuse your calm smile and moderate disapproval come face to face with
the other side you have, the one with a murderous intent far beyond your normal means. When
desiring to do such, you can emit killing intent that would normally be seen in someone much more
powerful than you. Powered by sheer thirst for blood, even at the level of a Vice Captain, it will
cause feelings of deep terror in experienced warriors. A Captain class user might force horrific
hallucinations to those subjected to her intent and it’ll only go up from there. A truly powerful being
could take lives just by walking among the weak, hearts ceasing to beat at the sight of her."
25,200,Twisted Words,Bleach,Destruction,"As deadly as the sword and spell are, it is the word that can bring even the greatest warrior to their
knees in despair. You’re viciously skilled at using your words to hurt others, knowing exactly how to
push them to the edge in the way you desire. Infuriate a calm minded noble with taunts on his faulty
moral code, send a wolfman into a blind and ineffectual rage with mockery of his master or spread
doubt and distrust among your foes by hinting at agents among their ranks. Your skill is in the many
ways words can be used to spread pain, fear, distrust and despair. If someone listens to you, the fool
that they are, they very well could end up played against themselves. It’ll only get worse if they try
to argue, given your talent for twisting a person’s words against them. In a potentially less cruel use, this also aids you in teasing out the full bloodlust and fighting spirit of those you speak to, for a good fight or to train them into effective warriors. They’re not likely to be too happy with the process though."
26,200,Break it Down for Me,Jujutsu Kaisen,Destruction,"One of the most interesting concepts in jujutsu is that of binding vows. By intentionally putting oneself in a disadvantageous situation, such as by imposing extra restrictions upon the usage of a cursed technique, a sorcerer can gain power proportional to the extra risk they took on. One of the most common variants of this is the increase in power sorcerers get by disclosing how their technique works to their opponents, since giving up such information discards an advantage they might otherwise possess.

As a fundamental part of jujutsu, any sorcerer is capable of making such a binding vow by default. With this perk, however, you are able to apply this concept to any of your other powers. By voluntarily explaining how one of your powers works to your foes, that power will become noticeably more effective against them. Fires will burn hotter, energy blasts fly faster and hit harder, and so on. With clever wording, you can even use this to mislead your opponents on how your ability functions while still gaining the power boost, such as through lying by omission. Naturally, if those you’re up against already know how the ability you’re using functions, you won’t gain any power by telling them how it works.

You’re also capable of applying other restrictions to yourself and your powers. Perhaps you limit yourself to a certain level of output for part of the day, increasing your power proportionally for the rest of it. Or perhaps you drastically increase your speed by significantly reducing your durability. However these self-imposed vows work, the power you gain will always be directly proportional to the risk you take on. Be aware, though, that placing or removing such a restriction upon yourself takes a fair amount of time and focus, preventing you from changing them on the fly during combat. Removing a restriction also removes any power gained from it."
27,200,Absolute Power,Ragna Crimson,Destruction,"While you don’t possess such a thing just with this, you can surely make it those who are weaker than you think so. Your power radiates from you in the form of what others would call an oppressive aura of fear and awe. This aura makes those who are weaker than you physically feel the difference in your abilities. The higher the difference of power between you, the stronger this effect is, to the point that those who would be instantly killed by your attacks would become paralyzed and unable to take any action before your mighty presence."
28,200,Destroying Soul and Body,Gourmet Of Another World,Destruction,"Once a being's soul becomes strong enough it is possible for them to survive after their bodies have been destroyed. Not only that, but an expert is even capable of reforging their body once more. This means that you have to destroy both the body and soul of your opponent to truly kill them at least normally. This perk makes it so that whenever you kill someone you may ignore any special conditions or requirements and they will stay dead. For example if you destroy a Soul Demons body then they will die permanently."
29,200,The Tyrannical and Oppressive Presence,Against The Gods,Destruction,"For all the cultivation you might do and
achievements you can attain, can you really be considered powerful unless you’ve reduced a grown
and experienced, battle-hardened adult to a blubbering mess with nothing more than your aura and
the look in your eyes?
Seems not. Good thing you have both, now! You have the ability to generate a massive, immense
aura far around you, a humongous thing that stands above and beyond anything possible for people
even several times more powerful than you. It can be a fear aura, wherein you appear as something
out of ancient legends, a devil or demon of utterly nightmarish power, or it could be a ‘good’ aura, or
perhaps it could appear as either to people depending on your mutual feelings and intentions
towards each other.
In either case, you can do a lot with this, including making it semi-visual with your shadows or a
heat haze or just an illusionary presence around you or so. It reflects your power in relation to the
world around you, and you can fine-tune it to reflect or not reflect anything and everything about
you. Sky’s the limit, really."
30,200,Poisonous Fang Touch,One finger Death Punch,Destruction,"Even one finger is enough to cripple a foe, the blows of the martial artist equivalent to deadly
venom. Each blow they survive makes them slower to react and sluggish to defend."
31,200,Deep Impact,One finger Death Punch,Destruction,"The earth shakes and submits under the weight of One Finger. The fighter may clear a wide swathe
of ground around them with a blow, the force rippling outwards in concentric circles. A favourite of
crowd clearing, and demolition works."
32,200,Raise Your Swords,Solars Exalted,Destruction,"The Solar Exalted were forged in an act of rebellion against the
supreme creators of this world, elevating mere mortals into the status of legendary heroes and
bringing the titanic Primordials to heel. Now, echoes of that action resonate in you - those who
are oppressed, whether by a tyrant or a heavenly despot, call to the flames of war at the sound
of your words. You may incite rebellion on a grand scale with little more than an encouraging
speech, and even the absolutely steadfast and loyal will question their masters at the sound of
your words. Obviously, this works best if there is an actual tyrant or sadistic force to overthrow in
the first place...benign or even benevolent rulers will find their people more resistant to this
change, though with time, even they may come to be despised. In addition, when you are
opposing a superior or ‘higher’ force in battle or with words, you will find yourself more
competent, your speech more biting, and your blows just a little stronger."
33,200,The King Is Here,Infernals Exalted,Destruction,"Malfeas is the King of the Yozi, and incomparable in his invincible power. Once he was the
Infinite Radiant Is, the supernal transcendence of all divinity, the Holy Tyrant, the King of the
Primordials. Though he may now be unjustly bound to rage impotently, as he dances and
forgets himself, some of that ancient splendor is shown again. Likewise, you will be seen by
all as a powerful king, incomparable in your own right... and in anger and hate you will gain
an aura of terror, that the weak-willed shall flee before you and the powerful shall be shaken.
Yet when you feel joy and your heart is at peace, you will gain instead an aura of awe and
brilliance that all who see you will feel as though your divine majesty is one who should be
their king."
34,200,Shadow of All Things,Infernals Exalted,Destruction,"See, while all the other Yozi are more focussed on the big picture, on the gods and humanity
as a whole... The Ebon Dragon hates every single being personally, and finds greater joy in
thwarting the dreams of others than advancing his own agenda. Appropriately, you will gain
a similar aptitude in corrupting and seducing others away from virtue and honor. You will
know how to tempt anyone, how to slowly corrupt their morals, how to reveal horrible truths
or tell vile lies at just the right moment to turns heroes into villains. But if you're not feeling
like corrupting, you will be just as skilled in breaking their wills by taking away just what they
love most, torturing their weakest most sensitive areas, showing them what they fear most,
tormenting them, and even defiling their happiest memories, until they are all but hollow
husks just as the Dragon itself."
35,200,Caged Beast Struggles Within Chains,Abyssals Exalted,Destruction,"When an Abyssal’s aura blooms into the terrible, dark majesty of their full totemic
manifestation, any mortal who sees it feels both the terror and the lure of the Void. Merely
mortal minds can break when subjected to such horror. Many of them faint, run away, grovel
in worship, while an unlucky few suffer much worse fates.
But it is the Peacebringers who embody the terror of the Void more than any of their fellows,
able to envelop themselves in an aura of dread such that their enemies fear even to look at
them. Of course, you need neither anima nor aura, for intimidation is so intertwined with you
that a mere glance could send a man running in panic and a threatening word is dreaded
enough to rout an army. Your skill at scare tactics and spreading terror amongst your victims
is supreme, demoralizing and horrifying your opponents with casual ease."
36,300,Wolf Amongst Sheep,"A Cultivator's Beginning",Destruction,"While nearly all cultivators learn various martial techniques, many of them only practice those techniques in sparring matches and demonstrations. You’ve learned that the only way to bring out the true power of these techniques is to use them in life-and-death struggles.

You are capable of using lethal force without hesitation and can unfailingly recognize when others seek to seriously harm or kill you. You can effortlessly target your opponents’ weaknesses and exploit them for the maximum in brutality."
37,300,Berserker,History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi,Destruction,"While others may call upon their ki to enhance their strength or
endurance, your enhancement is without limit. The longer you remain in a high stress combat
situation, the greater your ki will expand and the stronger you will become. You will need to be
stressed and quite angry to perpetuate it, but so long as you remain in combat, your strength and
the force of your blows will steadily increase. If combat wanes or you lose your feelings of
aggression however, your strength will atrophy and you will return to your baseline strength
within a few moments."
38,300,"No More Steel, Empty Hands",Baki The Grappler,Destruction,"The next step-up from mere hand-blades. Just as a master calligrapher no longer needs
paper, you can use weapons with your bare hands. Any weapon-based art you know you
can replicate with your body alone. The effectiveness just barely falls short of the real
deal, letting your chops cut like swords, or your pokes pierce like bullets. –"
39,300,"Have we Regressed?",Baki The Grappler,Destruction,"Hard not to think humanity has taken a step back somewhere. In your hands, the old ways
will always trump the ways of the present. No gun can stand up to a sword in your hand,
a martial art with mere decades of history has no hope against your ancient techniques,
and modern tactics will be useless against those from centuries past."
40,300,Population Threat,Toriko,Destruction ,"Just, wow. It seems that you become so dangerous that you become considered a threat to the sentient population. With it comes resistance to tools that are made by sentient beings, used mostly in wars. With passing time, that resistance will transform into full blown immunity. Also strength will start to grow with passing time, but for that it has to pass a large amount of time to be noticeable. For an undiscounted 300 CP it becomes a World Threat: Now, thanks to it Gourmet Cells start adapting and evolving at a rapid pace in order to counter natural phenomenons that would hinder their growth. Temperature changes, electric discharges and even natural barriers will steadily have a lesser impact on your form with passing time.
"
41,300,Shield Breaker,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Destruction ,"They hide behind their cheat weapons and armor. They believe themselves untouchable... lets test that theory why don’t we? As a weapon there is no defence you cant break, no Armor you cant penetrate and no shield that cant be pierced. This by itself doesn’t kill anyone, but their defences that shield them will be like paper to you. Just be careful that breaking their defences doesn’t make them even stronger."
42,400,Vengeful Star,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"The thing about battle is, in most cases, the warrior is at their best state at the beginning of the battle. As the battle continues, they become wounded, tired, and sometimes unwilling to fight. But at least you can hurt your enemy just as badly as they harm you. When you are hit, you may inflict the same amount of damage you have taken on your enemy. The more enemies you're fighting, the more dispersed the damage is, and it is less damage they take. Of course, this won’t help against someone completely immune to any and all attempts at harm, but anything less than that is gonna be damaged, though magical effects from the wound don’t spread with the damage."
43,400,Boiling Blood,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"Some people say the only way to fight properly is to know what you are doing at all times. But this doesn’t apply to you. The more reckless you are in battle, the more damage you can soak and the more pain you can deal out. Also, as a side effect, your body is so brutal that when you bleed, the blood literally sprays at your enemy at such a force it can damage them even through plate armor."
44,400,Meti’s Technique,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"By calling your attack, you become much more lethal to your target. When you target a single person, all your attacks against them are far, far more lethal and brutal. What could have bruised them before would go right through them with this."
45,400,Howl of the Cursed,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"You have been cursed. Or was it a blessing? Regardless of the intent, you are now able to turn into a rampaging monstrous, warped, or bestial form. While in this form, all natural abilities (and I mean stuff like sharp claws and teeth, not genetic-based powers) are enhanced, to the point where your claws could cut through steel like it isn’t even there, and you can flip cars with one hand."
46,400,Hero Hunter,One Punch Man,Destruction,"You possess Garou’s single-minded determination to take down the strongest fighters. Your entire being is dedicated to the hunt—tracking down powerful opponents and defeating them in combat. When facing opponents who are stronger or more renowned, your power grows exponentially, as if driven by your desire to prove yourself. The more powerful your foe, the more you rise to the occasion, pushing yourself to your absolute peak. Against heroes, martial masters, or even gods, you become a relentless force of destruction. In combat, you radiate an aura that strikes fear into even the most courageous fighters, making them falter before they face your wrath."
47,400,Blade Beyond Steel,One Punch Man,Destruction,"Your connection to your blade goes beyond physical skill. You have honed your swordsmanship to such a degree that your weapon becomes an extension of your very soul. No matter the material, you can wield your sword with such finesse that it can cut through objects far stronger than steel—be it reinforced armor, magical barriers, or even energy-based attacks. Your blade can sever through nearly anything, and no defense is safe from the sharpness of your strikes."
48,400,One vs Many ,Tekken,Destruction,"A Ninja is a master of fighting against odds using everything they have at their
disposal. Some think you could be simply overrun with larger numbers. This wont work now. If you
can defeat every single enemy in a group in a One on One fight you will be able to take them as a
Team as well.
"
49,400,Dangerous Dragon,Saint Seiya : The Original Series,Destruction,"The common way of fighting with Cosmo is
doing so while supplemented by the armor granted by the Gods (or replicas made by human
hands), but a certain desperation tactic involves one shedding their armor and burning a large
amount of Cosmo at once to unleash a final attack. This is along those lines, and you’ve
become an expert at it - you have a natural talent for channeling Cosmo into your physical form
and the power of your hand-to-hand strikes, letting you keep up with a skilled Saint in Bronze
Armor without any difficulty...perhaps even being able to catch a Gold Saint off guard, if you’re
lucky."
50,400,Antares,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Destruction,"When it comes to this level of stakes or desperation, you might as well give it all for it. You have the very special ability to empower one and only one of your attacks tremendously, so much so that when at the climax of a tiring battle it will have the strength of your prime, while at your prime it would let you surpass anything you’ve ever done. It however comes at the great cost of most of your life energy, a tiring process which, given the situation you’d have to be to rely on this… probably mean all you have left. For peace and victory, are you ready to give your life ?"
51,400,Benu’s Hate,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Destruction,"Emotions can be a strong motivation and fuel, both in and out of combat. For you though, it is almost literal. Hate, despair, envy, vengeance, or otherwise negative emotion you truly feel, makes you stronger, faster, and determined. The stronger the emotion, the greater the effect, although it can only do so much."
52,400,Purifying Punch ,Saint Seiya Episode G,Destruction,"No more will you need to lament that you cannot solve every problem with your fists because now you are able to solve slightly more problems than normal with your fists! While your attacks might normally be limited to harming the physical, you’ve gained the ability to strike directly at the bad things that are inside people. You can punch out possessing spirits, roundhouse kick away bad feelings and even karate chop all kinds of sicknesses or diseases that hide in the bodies of your friends, hoping to avoid the unstoppable force of your mighty blows. So long as you intend to strike at the bad things within someone, your blows won’t do them any harm either."
53,400,Holy Punishment,Saint Seiya Episode G,Destruction,"Sinners shall be punished in accordance to their crimes, so says the divine will. That your will is that divine will makes little difference to your opponents, who now find that their sins against you and your beliefs empower your blows against them. The worse a man has sinned against your personal moral code, the more you find your attacks against them to become stronger and stronger. While some foes that are already stronger than you may not see much difference, you yourself will find that against great enough sinners, your attacks are several times stronger than they would normally be."
54,400,Like Water Through a Grate,Saint Seiya Episode G,Destruction,"There are few defenses that can stand up to your attacks, given most of your offense just ignores most defenses entirely. You are able to fire your attacks straight past any kind of physical defenses, directly piercing into the thing behind that defense. This allows you to strike a Saint’s body through their armor or to hit at a man’s soul within his physical form. You could even use this to strike at the Cosmo of someone with just physical blows."
55,400,Anti Magical Armour ,Saint Seiya Episode G,Destruction,"The only reason the humans have any hope at all is those blasted Cloths. Pale imitations of your own to be sure but not without power of their own. When faced with your hands however, they seem rather less durable. Your attacks are particularly good at destroying objects and artefacts of supernatural power or importance. Even things meant to be indestructible or at least far tougher than anything you should be able to scratch can be cracked and torn apart under your hands. Tougher things will still take repeated blows for you to smash apart but even the mightiest artefact won’t stand up for too long against you."
56,400,Wisteria Blood,Demon Slayer,Destruction,"For some reason, your blood has the opposite effect on demons - rather than be life-giving nutrient, it is as deadly to them as wisteria, which has been used famously as a weapon by the Insect Pillar and her acolytes against the demon plague. Demons who take this instead become immune to wisteria's effects; they can't use this offensively like a human, but it does at least remove one of their more annoying weaknesses. Your blood is harmful to other creatures similarily evil to demons in future jumps."
57,400,Locust Fangs: Fists of Mass Destruction,Avesta of Black and White,Destruction,"You have mastered the art of removing the energy dispersal from your attacks, much like the members of the Locust Swarm Ashema. Whether through the Power of Ego or another technique, this means that you have the unique ability to always unleash your full power on your designated target without causing any damage to the surrounding scenery or spectators.

And, like the Ashema, you're not doing this out of concern for the environment, but to satisfy a desire to inflict the most damage possible on your adversary. As a result, your attacks become much more deadly as your opponent is forced to confront you with all of your strength. Punches capable of shattering planets will atomize your victim rather than transforming the planet into a jumble of floating rocks. A useful skill for those who are primarily interested in one-on-one battles."
58,400,Dragon Fear,Trinity Wonder,Destruction,"The impressive aura of a dragon, that oppresses all other beings. Actually, this is more a natural magical talent of dragons, who can use mana to paralyse those around them. Some special warriors can resist this paralysis, and there are spells like anti-magic shields that can be used in advance to stop it. However, if caught unawares, this can be devastating as warriors freeze and mages become unable to cast the spells needed to counter it. Even the likes of Pink Papa were made helpless once caught by surprise. This does require some concentration to maintain, so if under attack you may find it easier to let it drop rather than split your attention."
59,400,Sunset Smile,Bleach,Destruction,"It’s never been hard to get what you want. A few words from that honey-laden tongue and people
almost fall over, trying to accommodate you. The human mind is so open to change, so long as one
knows the right words to say. Manipulating other people is a rare gift you possess, at least on the
level you can perform. Mere lying is a simple game, little short of outright magic detecting
falsehoods from your lips and even those easy to fool with a few word games. You know how to
make people want to believe your lies, to ignore evidence to the contrary and to slowly bind them to
your will in time. A few months of friendship to outsider’s eyes and yet a steady and thorough
brainwash by your intentions, as you can mess with someone’s mind and even sanity or core beliefs
if given enough time. This isn’t just about making people like you. Dragging out hidden rage, pitting two friends against each other as mortal enemies, even enhancing the effectiveness with which you wield illusions or
similar powers by combining your talents for manipulating minds with supernatural power. You live
to lie and as long as no one finds out, it’ll be a pretty good life. "
60,400,Jumper the Terrible,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Destruction ,"A Tyrant you are. Severity and brutality unmatched. Immortalized as the worst tyrant of the country even. Or at least you have the capacity to be. Your mere presence leaves lesser men shaking in their boots, like a heavy pressure is forced upon them. Determined individuals or particularly charismatic ones can resist this effect but those who don’t find themselves weakened in your presence, not as strong as they should be. And that is if they chose to fight at all and not merely surrender to you. Anyone that looks at you shall know fear."
61,400,Sadistic Constitution,Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity,Destruction ,"Few can deny that you are a skilled and powerful warrior, everyone saw how you’ve wrestled giant
beasts to death and ably compete with some of the best warriors in Rome with your favoured
weapon, be it swords or spears or bows. But that’s not why people feel fear in their hearts when
they think of you on the battlefield. You have the ability to enter a monstrous rage that massively
increases your physical strength and speed, which will only continues to increases as you remain in
the rage, but causes your physical durability and reason to significantly degrade at the start, though
you retain all your fighting skill. When in this rage, you’ll continue to hunt down any enemies you
consider near and are near immune to mental interference from others, though not entirely so to
very powerful magicians. The rage can be ended with great effort, but given that you can refrain
from hurting allies and will only hunt enemies, one questions why you’d want to. It’d be so much
easier to give yourself to the endless red fury and allow all your enemies to be slaughtered, from
invading barbarians to those annoying politicians that bother you back at home. "
62,400,Long Sought Execution,Fate/Legends - Strange New World,Destruction ,"Humanity’s thoughts and feelings are what shape the course of history. Is it so strange that feelings
as strong as your own could warp the world? Not when they’re such dark emotions. When pursuing
goals motivated by hate, vengeance, rage and other negative feelings, you can find that these goals
become unnaturally easy to achieve the stronger those feelings get. The fabric of reality twists in
ways to make normally difficult things easy and near impossible things achievable, at least if you are
deep enough in your fury. The impossible cannot be made possible but enemies that would normally
dodge your attacks may find you moving faster than should be possible for your body or that your
strikes tear deeply into their normally too-tough flesh."
63,400,Aptitude for Slaughter,Fate/Legends - Baba Yaga,Destruction ,"How many times have humans died by their fellow men using guns and weapons of destruction? Or caused the deaths of countless animals with their machines of fire and steel? But there has to be someone who excels at causing death. That someone is now you.

Your aptitude for killing humans allows you to expertly use any manmade weapon or gun of your era. Not only that but your weapons become several times more powerful when used by you, multiple times so when used against humans. It is overdue for them isn’t it?

Alternatively you may instead gain the same kind of aptitude but for animals instead, allowing you to manipulate and exert control over haired beasts, giving you much more power in efforts of taming or dominating animals. If you buy this Perk a second time (still Discounted for Spirits) you may gain both effects.

May be Purchased Multiple Times"
64,400,Overwhelming Might,Dragon Ball,Destruction,"Despite the decent array of unique
superpowers in Dragonball, pure
power often reigns supreme. A
common example of this is that
some powerful individuals are
capable of outright ignoring or
otherwise bypassing powers. Like Broly,
you are capable of this feat as well. You can essentially brute force your way through
anything as long as you are stronger. For example, if you were placed in a spatial or
temporal lock you could ignore it. This process becomes easier as you grow stronger."
65,400,Conforming to Convention is Emptiness,I Shall Seal The Heavens,Destruction,"No matter what happens, you have a sheer, sticky stubbornness that means you just won’t quit,
no matter what. Be it fighting fellow cultivators, or quite literally arguing with God, you won’t
be the one to back off, in the end.
And this pays off, too. There’s a strange phenomenon that occurs whenever you get into any
conflict. The longer you can retain the advantage, the longer you can stay on the attack and
keep the initiative, the easier it becomes for you to continue as such. In both combat and
argument it becomes harder and harder for the enemy to fight back the longer you manage to
keep hammering them, be it with your fists or your words.
Mind you, at some point they might just get frustrated enough to do something crazy to get rid
of you, so there’s that. This works on a longer, more permanent basis too, since the more often
you seize the initiative and win conflicts this way, the better you become at doing so in the
future, at rates of improvement that are well and truly supernatural.
Defeat someone enough times and, even if they sacrificed everything to successfully become
many times more powerful than your current state, crushing them would be like taking candy
from an infant."
66,400,Ravenous Fang and Gluttonous Talon,Abyssals Exalted,Destruction,"While the Abyssal Exalted are still alive, they do not respire the living energy of Creation as
most things do. Their Exaltations absorb the Essence that moves in the Underworld, flowing
inward from the far fringes to swirl and disappear into the Mouth of the Void. In Creation, and
other living realms, the Essence moves all wrong.
The Chosen of Death can, however, work around this limitation. Instead of respiring the
sickening Essence of Creation, they may feed on their victim's very life to recuperate lost
motes. Most Abyssals do so by extending their teeth into sharp fangs with which to rend
motes from the flesh and blood of sentient beings, but you have unlocked deeper secrets,
allowing you to drain the lifeforce from the living with but a touch or an unarmed strike.
Furthermore, while blades of Soulsteel are known to drain the essence from those they
strike, you have gained the curious ability to extend this to any weapon you wield and may
sup upon these drained motes as well."
67,400,The Shining Path,Abyssals Exalted,Destruction,"The cult of the Bishop follows a doctrine of escape from the cycle, the idea of letting go to
escape the suffering of existence. His cults lie to people, tricking them into leaping into
Oblivion. They argue that life is pain and suffering before dying, only to reincarnate into new
beings who lived lives equally full of pain and suffering. They say the comforting embrace of
Oblivion will erase all pain, end all unhappiness, scourge all regret. Sins will no longer exist,
for there will be none alive to commit them. The rich man and the poor man will be as
brothers, for there will be no wealth to hoard or covet. All will be at perfect, infinite peace. All
will be one with Oblivion. All will be good.
And taking the core of his doctrine to heart, you may take a more proactive approach to
enter all life into the Void, willingly or not. You may infuse your attacks with the
all-consuming void, making it so that whatever you slay can never be brought back. Things
wounded or broken by you can never be healed or mended. If you snapped a sword in half,
not even a master artisan could put the sword back together from its pieces, for it is forever
broken, it’s wholeness consigned to the Void. You may consign the souls of your victims to
Oblivion, never to leave a ghost. Only things too mighty to ever truly die are exempt from
this, as they instead form tomb-bodies like those of the Neverborn, doomed forever to the
agony of the dreaming dead."
68,500,Garuda’s Dominion,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Destruction,"Specter like you, with quite a lot of subordinates to handle, have to maintain order. With you however, order maintains itself. Why ? Fear. Any you largely overpower or inspire fear for any reason will be far more receptive to you, eventually to the point obedience. The closer they are to you in power or the less they fear you, the less it affects them. "
69,500,Woes of the Heart,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Destruction,"While all cultivators at your stage are the absolute pinnacle of luck and dedication, all with
godlike stories and personalities, they all still hold weaknesses in personality. Be it pride, lust,
greed, or cowardice they all have it unless they’ve truly perfected their Dao Hearts. Thus for
someone like you who can see all of these imperfections, it is almost trivial for you to exploit
them in battle. You may pick one way you can do this, from illusions to words, regardless,
anyone you fight and choose to exploit in this manner will have their fighting power drop by
nearly half (that is of course unless they have the aforementioned perfect Dao Heart)."
70,500,Godkiller,Records of Ragnarok Gauntlet (Humans),Destruction ,"One day... this is what the Einherjar will be remembered as, that is Brunhilde sure of. The man who stared Divinity in the eye and made them blink. For now... this isn’t set in stone... but for you? You who are the exception in all worlds? Well lets just say this Perk every human could really need. When your fighting someone of ‘divine’ origin, be it a God, Demon or Angel, you find yourself strengthened. Your attacks are stronger you can endure more... combine this with what you already possess and killing a God may not be totally impossible."
71,600,Immortal Hunter,UQ Holder,Destruction,"Even though you yourself are immortal, you’ve found that the lucrative business of hunting down other immortals is too good to resist. At the very least, you’re well-practiced in those arts. So well that you’ve gone from just knowing the stuff that can take down immortals to bypassing all their bullshit entirely. Your attacks ignore any form of immortality that might render them ineffective. The undying can be killed by you, those who regenerate do not do so when hit by your blades, and effects that might prevent their death or rewrite it will fail to activate when against you in combat.

"
72,600,The Bloody,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"The more people you slaughter with your own weapons and body, the more dangerous you become. All your attacks become more effective, your armor becomes harder to pierce, and your enemies become more squishy. The buff, however, depends on how much of a threat to you your enemy is, so seeking out armies of weaklings won’t change much, while someone who stands on an equal or greater stance than you have a much larger boost."
73,600,Reach Heaven through Violence,Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"A common saying across the Wheel is “reach the heavens through violence”, and it appears you have taken that to heart. In a battle, you seem to embody death. Ripping through entire crowds of armed and armored people, without making a noise nor getting a drop of blood or fluids on your outfit. Additionally, when you see something you haven’t fought before nor studied before, you can observe it, and find out its weakness and weak points, though the stronger and harder to kill something is comparatively to you the longer it’ll take, and at some point they would be strong enough that you can’t study them at all."
74,600,"We Shall Make an Anvil of Their Skulls, and My Heart Shall be the Forge ",Kill 6 Billions Demons,Destruction,"There is much evil in the Throne. Slavers, criminal empires, uncaring gods…. It's quite a big sh*tshow. But maybe you can change that? With this power, the more evil a person is, the stronger your blows against them. Let them hide, for Justice has come."
75,600,Die for Me,Saint Seiya Lost Canvas,Destruction,"Well, that’s a twisted form of charisma you have there. Your fear and demonstrations of authority are so effective, your minions are in practice closer to “brainwashed” than obedient, preferring death in a suicidal charge than by your cruel hands, or too fearful to even flee. Unless your equal in power and complete moral opposite shows up to give them doubts, they are yours.
"
76,600,Sealed Master,Saint Seiya Episode G,Destruction,"Most Saints have a few favorite techniques that they hone to perfection, rather than ranging broadly with the cosmos they choose to focus it. The epitome of this ideal is the Sealed Technique. An overwhelmingly powerful attack or technique that often comes with too much power to properly control or with a danger to the user or their allies. You’re able to progress techniques or attack moves that you know into this state. You may have one Sealed Technique at once, picking a particular overwhelming move you know and massively empowering that technique, at least to the upper level of what a Gold Saint can do if not higher if you are already beyond that level of power. In return, your Sealed technique or attacks will take on drawbacks such as being near impossible to control, harming you severely when activated or taking so much energy that it leaves you exhausted. With many long hours of practicing with the technique, you can learn to train off those flaws. Once the technique has had its flaws entirely removed or mastered, you may pick a new technique to make Sealed."
77,600,The Holy Breakthrough,Saint Seiya Episode G,Destruction,"Immortal? They've not met you yet. Unbreakable? Only till your fists of fury land the first blow. Unstoppable? Maybe so far but you'll have a try. Those things that are supposedly undying, without peer or absolute are only such because they've not yet met someone with enough raw power to tear through, someone like you. When you encounter such things, you are able to substitute raw power for any sort of workaround. You can kill immortal beings just by hitting them hard enough, break through unbreakable shields by throwing enough strength into an unstoppable move with enough power. To do this, you must outmatch the raw power of the target many times over, thus exchanging the usual battle of conceptual abilities for a much more straightforward and reasonable one of raw might."
78,600,Heretic Defence,Saint Seiya Episode G,Destruction,"To point your sword at a heavenly being is a sin and to outright attack one? There can be no way for someone to think they will escape punishment for such a sacrilegious act. The act of attacking you reflects a certain amount of harm back on those who try to do you harm. While this provides no protection against their attacks, it does ensure that they receive a certain amount of damage from you instantly because of it. The stronger you are compared to your attacker, the worse the damage they automatically receive is. Those equal to you may just receive the equivalent of a strong punch from yourself but those lesser might take on a dozen blows or a hundred or a thousand of your strength all at once."
79,600,Solo Numbering Skill 5 : <Seven Strands Spear>,Reincarnator,Destruction,"Seven Strands Spear is a
skill that shoots out a beam of laser. A laser that was solely created for destruction.
A destructive skill with the highest power. No other attack skill had a higher
destructive force than the Seven Strands Spear. It is a finishing move that gathers a
tremendous amount of mana to compress into seven beams of light to fire. Metiron,
a Yellow Zone adventurer, struggled to control it even with the use of the Mana
Jade(Note: A lower tiered mana engine). Its attacks surpass the Rank 3 Solo
Number skill, Elemental Outfit."
80,600,Zero Numbering Skill : <Nine Dragons Spear>,Reincarnator,Destruction,"The Nine Dragons Spear
creates nine dragons using mana. The dragon sweeps past the user's heart and rolls
around the body, gets sent out of one's hand and coils up an artifact. The skill
forcibly squeezes out the mana of the user and causes one's body to forcefully twist
and break. When the nine Mana dragons of different colors collect on the tip of the
weapon, it forms a tiny black sphere that shoots out at the speed of light to pierce the
enemy. This tiny black sphere leaves behind damage tens of meters wide. At 0%
mastery, the sphere is the size of a marble. As the mastery of the skill increases, the
size of the sphere increases and the body experiences less strain. The dragons
appear thicker and deeper in color as the user becomes stronger"
81,600,The Demonheart,Desolate Era : The Three Realms,Destruction,"Long ago, when this world
wasn’t shattered, but instead whole with the name of Pangu Chaosworld, a massive land the size of

the entire Three Realms combined , the many denizens realized that they were heading straight
into a collision with another Chaosworld by the name of Seamless Chaosworld. As is natural for
this, both sides immediately went to war with each other, unwilling to allow who they saw as
invaders to live in their world. To make a long story short, Mother Nuwa broke through to an
entirely new level of power at the apex of the war, and then proceeded to chase the survivors of the
Seamless Chaosworld into the Primordial Chaos. However, the battle thoroughly ruined and
shattered both Chaosworlds , causing them to be reshaped into the Three Realms of the present by
the victors of what was from then on known as the Endwar. The most important fact, however, is
that during this recreation, the Seamless Chaosworld was used as the stable pillar upon which the
Three Realms would be built. Due to this, the Heavenly Dao of the Demonheart from the Seamless
Chaosworld remains slumbering, not yet wholly gone. Like another certain someone, you’ve
gained insight into this Dao, and with it you can manipulate the hearts of mortals and Cultivators
alike. With only minimal insight into it, you could easily cause wars among mortals and twist
weaker cultivators to fully subordinate themselves to you. With full mastery, causing a war that
engulfs a whole Chaosworld and making the closest of friends split apart to join different causes
would be child’s play. To reach this level is still a long ways away however."
82,600,The Genius Killer,Desolate Era : The Chaosverse,Destruction,"Each and every World God, Daolord, and Eternal Emperor represents the pinnacle of genius.
Each of them has created a foundation necessary to ascend and has the mind to comprehend
absolutely massive concepts like the Dao, no matter their complication throughout the eons.
Thus it would be absurd to assume that these absolute pinnacles of strength, intelligence,
cunning, and luck will simply stay static as you grow stronger. Thankfully, you know a thing or
two about dealing with Geniuses, boosted by the fact that whenever you face an opponent in
battle, and survive, their strength no longer becomes capable of growing to match yours. Until
they die, or stop being enemies, their strength shall never grow from when you fought them.
Keep in mind, this has to be a fight. You cannot just throw a punch then run, you have to actually
engage them in combat/survive for at least several exchanges with an enemy."
83,600,Denying the Heavens: A Bullet for God,Avesta of Black and White,Destruction,"The Avesta, the war between Good and Evil and the Commandments. Why would you have to follow all of these rules? Well, you have something to set your own rules when it comes to fighting, at least. In exchange for sealing the usage of any special powers in battle, you become able to negate them for your enemies as well. Immortal monsters suddenly feel that they have trouble closing their wounds when you produce them, supposedly undodgeable attacks that twist space become something that you can move around, and even abilities designed to track you have a hard time pinpointing your location.

The major downside from this ability, besides not being able to use any powers while it is active, it’s that it is only at its maximum strength when you are dueling someone. In group battles, the effectiveness of this will be severely reduced, to the point that your foes will notice that their powers aren’t working correctly, but they won’t be completely gone. Hope you have something to compensate for that. And don’t try to take on things that are too far beyond your scale with just this, a mortal man wouldn’t do well against a black hole."
84,600,Princes of the Universe,Campione,Destruction,"Pandora is the name of the goddess who creates the Campione. An artifact known as the Circle of Usurpation, and a glitch in the system of divine reincarnation allows her to take certain things from the slain heretic gods, and instead award them to her adopted children. Regardless of the details of the system, you now own a slightly different copy. This fake Circle of Usurpation is not necessary to continue to grow in power in other worlds, but rather for other worlds to grow in power. Once per jump you can select a ‘type’ of foe for this to affect. In the same way Campione gain Authorities from the slain Gods, you can set a system that gifts powers from those slain beings to others that match your rules."
85,600,False Eyes of Death Perception ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"Technically, the true name for these is ‘Mystic Eyes of Life Perception’ or would be along those lines if it was properly identified. You are able to perceive the ‘life force’ that sustains a living being, appearing as lines and points around said living being. By cutting along or damaging these lines and points, you can greatly damage the being in question as their life force is burned away, likely killing them if enough damage is inflicted. However, you cannot truly see ‘death’, and as such cannot actualize it upon a living being or even an unliving or inanimate object - thus rather than instantly killing the target, it merely critically damages them until their bodies cannot take much more. In short, all these Eyes can do is inflict damage upon that which lives, the same as any weapon or method of murder.
"
86,600,Mystic Eyes of Death Perception ,Kara no Kyokai,Destruction,"The eyes that see the path to the end. Among the highest grade of Mystic Eye possible, Death Perception becomes quite literal, They see the lines and dots that mark all ‘living’ things, anything that has any sort of direct interaction with the living world. An object, a person, a ghost, telekinetic force exerted by a psychic or even a timeline, if it were made certain and absolute enough to become solid in your eyes. Tracing these lines with something that cuts, even a blunt butter knife, will separate them without doubt. Cutting the target into pieces. Piercing one of the dots you can see, a single one on any being, is enough to destroy almost all things. While your eyes do not strain you, not all things can be cut so easily. Things that are resistant to death or associated with it will have faded lines, difficult to see or even requiring several minutes of focus to see at all. Dead Apostles, those who have achieved a deathless state of enlightenment, ones who practice death magic and, especially, beings who lack the concept of death at all on whom lines cannot even be seen. Your eyes do not strain you with their use, though you should always be careful with the cutting tools you hold.
"
87,600,Truth of the World,Angel Notes,Destruction ,"They come to your world, bringing death and terror. They say they have no concept of death, that
they cannot even comprehend what failure is. That’s alright. You’ve always been a good teacher. With your fists and blades and weapons, you can force these concepts and many others onto an
enemy, making them part of their very being. The undying can die. The eternally victorious can lose. Those fated for a single path in life are given freedom. Each of your blows can imprint one such
concept onto something it successfully strikes. What limits you is that you can only teach what you
yourself comprehend. If you cannot die, you cannot introduce death to a being that does not have it.
If you don’t weaken to old age, you can’t make something weak from age either."
88,600,Demon King,Fate/Legends - The land of The Rising Sun,Destruction ,"Japan is more than just some island filled with ghosts and spirits of old. These witches and youkai
and outdated swordsman just don’t comprehend what the rising sun means for this country but it
won’t be forever. More and more will appear those that cut down the mystery that holds the nation
back from it’s destiny. You’re one of these chosen ones, given the power to fight back against the
gods in ways they cannot understand. You are naturally much more capable at starting and
supporting revolutions against established powers or governments, seeing yourself and your fellow
rebels much more fortunate when fighting together against such order. 

Your entire being is infused with the power to harm mystery and the beings filled with it. The greater
the mystery of your opponent, the more fantastical or magical or legendary they are meant to be, the more powerful you become when challenging them. This also applies twice over to those who
have a divine nature, boosting you a second time. Your body, your weapons and even spells or other
abilities become more powerful from this, albeit only against the right targets. With an exertion of
energy, you are even able to drag all those around you into a Reality Marble created from this anti- mystery power. Manifesting as a blazing battlefield hell, it subjects those other than you within it to
heat and fire. The greater their mystery and divinity, the hotter and wilder these flames become. Those without such things feel only a bit of heat but great gods and mythical heroes can find all their
power scorched away in these hell fires. Should it not be enough, you can also summon large and
powerful skeletons with burnt-black bones to attack those trapped in this dimension or partially
summon the same entities outside of it for aid in combat."
89,600,Godslayer,Fate/Legends - Land of Shadows,Destruction ,"The gods of this world seem to be mighty but only to those who do not realise the potential within
their own forms. The gods are far from the invincible overlords they once came close to being and
these days, are indeed just another mountain for a hero to conquer. You’ve been training yourself
for this feat and have already slain many minor divine spirits, which has embedded a curious aspect
of power in your spirit. Your actions have a far greater effect against any divine being, even just
things that call themselves divine to a lesser extent, such that your blows that might normally only
bruise or scratch will deliver actual wounds instead. You can easily sense the presence of any divine
being or their servants within a vast area around yourself, enabling for the easy hunting of such
arrogant creatures, and you possess an immense degree of resistance to their powers of Authority, allowing any divine being to use a tenth of their domain-based powers at most. Of course, you have prepared yourself as even with this, a god is no easy prey. While you do not have the skill or abilities
that other perks earlier may give, you find yourself a incredibly accomplished combatant with a
enormous variety of weapons. You won’t fight any Gods of the Spear to a stand still but anything
much less is easy hunting. Your raw physical and magical abilities are quite astonishing, only being a
few steps below that of a proper demigod, though as yet you seem to lack any magical training."
90,600,End of Eras,Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon,Destruction ,"For every truly great hero, there is a truly terrible foe that lays him low at the end of his story. The
dragon that kills the king after his pride leads him to ruin, the traitorous knight that ruins the
kingdom out of jealous rage, the former friend that stabs an emperor in the back because he has
gone too far. These heroes that are destined for great things are defeated by beings like you, the
villains of the story. You have the ability to break through things like fate and destiny in order to kill
those who should not die yet and stop stories that should yet go on. Luck and the protection of a
story are nothing before you and indeed, the greater the fate and more protected by destiny your
opponent is, the more powerful you seem to become when faced against them. The Once and
Future King, despite their lofty purpose, is truly never weaker than when before you."
91,800,Mystic Eyes of Death Perception ,Tsukihime,Destruction,"All things die eventually. No matter how clever you are or what paradox you invoke to escape it, all that which is born ‘alive into this world will eventually leave it. And now, having seen such a thing up close at some point in your life, your body has internalized it in those beautiful eyes of yours. You are able to perceive ‘death’ itself on living beings and physical objects, appearing as thin red lines. When You touch or cut along these lines, the object or being in question is immediately cut deeply regardless of their durability, and attempts at healing or regeneration are greatly stunted -perhaps even made impossible for some beings, though the lines are thinner and more difficult to target the tougher a target is. At first, these lines are all you can perceive and influence, but after some time passes they will become clearer to your eyes and you will eventually see circular ‘points’ on their body that the lines all trace back to. Cutting or stabbing this point of death directly will immediately kill the target in question - no form of reincarnation, resurrection, or regeneration will save them from the bitter taste of death. This is what it means to kill something. With time and continued use, you may eventually be able to understand and perceive the concept of death in less tangible things, such as the spells of Magecraft or the empty space between you and an object, though the same general rules apply- and some things can only be ‘cut’, not ‘killed’, for they have no point of death.

However, perceiving how fragile the world and existence as a whole really is...that’s something no human mind can truly bear witnessing. When your eyes are active, the perception of death trains the mind and can eventually cause a human brain to suffer a fatal aneurysm from continued use, and can also damage one’s sanity as they are constantly made to understand the concept of death all around them. Even to an inhuman mind that can sustain the physical damage and the sanity-straining view of entropy, they are tiring to use in the long-term without preparation or precautions. Secondly, the ‘points’ of death may never appear for certain beings- beings that were never ‘born’ or are free of the concept of death entirely, such as a True Ancestor at the peak of their power during the night of a full moon - you would have to remove the source of their immortality or introduce them to the possibility of mortality in a different way, which is beyond the scope of using these alone. The strain also increases the longer you perceive the death of things beyond living beings or physical objects, which can do great damage to your mind if you’re unprepared for it.
